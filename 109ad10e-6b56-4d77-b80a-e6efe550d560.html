What's on the menu for delivery today?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon, A! We've got a mix of Korean and Western food. Some customers are craving for kimchi jjigae and others want a classic cheeseburger.<p class=message>That sounds like a challenging mix to handle. Do you have any preference?<p class="message sent">I'm definitely going for the kimchi jjigae today. The spicier, the better!<p class=message>Haha, I can see you like a bit of a kick to your food. Don't forget to bring some extra water for yourself!<p class="message sent">Oh, absolutely. Sometimes, even my sweat feels like it's on fire!<p class=message>*laughs* Speaking of spice, I think one of our customers requested for extra hot sauce on their wings. Can you handle that?<p class="message sent">Of course, A. Bring it on! I've developed a high tolerance for spiciness over the years.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. You should try our in-house hot sauce challenge sometime. It's not for the faint of heart!<p class="message sent">Challenge accepted! I'll have to try that on my next break.<p class=message>Sounds like fun! In the meantime, let's make sure we get these deliveries out on time. Our customers are counting on us to satisfy their cravings.<p class="message sent">You got it, A. Time to get these wheels moving!<p class=message>Don't forget to check the delivery addresses carefully. Last week, I accidentally delivered a burger to the wrong house!<p class="message sent">Oh no! I'll definitely double-check this time. Thanks for the reminder, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. And remember, always smile and be polite to the customers. That's our golden rule.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. A friendly smile can brighten up someone's day, especially during these tough times.<p class=message>That's the spirit! Now, let's hit the road and get these orders delivered. Go, team!<p class="message sent">Yeah! Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=109a7cc4-4a56-4514-9552-0a0c9ac2201f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
