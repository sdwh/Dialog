It's a way for organizations to ensure that their third-party vendors are handling sensitive data securely.<p class=message>Exactly! It's about time companies took this seriously.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's not just their own data they have to worry about, but customer data too.<p class=message>Absolutely. And with data breaches being so common nowadays, it's crucial to have these security measures in place.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I just wish more companies would take it seriously, though.<p class=message>Tell me about it. Some companies still think they can just sweep security under the rug.<p class="message sent">Yeah, like it's not important or something. But they'll change their tune once they've had a data breach.<p class=message>Have you seen the requirements for ISO 27001 Third Party Security?<p class="message sent">Yeah, they're pretty comprehensive. But that's a good thing. It means that organizations are taking security seriously.<p class=message>Absolutely. And it's not just about the technical side of things, but also policies and procedures.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's all about having a comprehensive approach to security. It's not just one thing.<p class=message>Exactly. It's like a puzzle. You need all the pieces to make it work.<p class="message sent">And even then, you still need to keep updating and improving your security measures.<p class=message>Definitely. It's a never-ending process, but an important one.<p class="message sent">For sure. It's better to be proactive than reactive when it comes to security.<p class=message>Amen to that!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b130eefb-eaa8-4be9-ba55-88474cd82754.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
