How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">Hi A, it's going pretty good. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain, but hey, I spotted some vulnerabilities in the source code during my security audit.<p class="message sent">Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What did you find?<p class=message>A couple of input validation issues that could allow attackers to inject malicious code into the application.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's definitely concerning. Have you figured out how to patch it yet?<p class=message>Yes, I've already created a report detailing the problem and recommended ways to remediate it.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll take a look at that right away. By the way, how do you always nail these security checks? It's like you have a sixth sense or something.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, I've just had a lot of practice and a keen eye for detail. Plus, it's easier when you work alongside a talented dev like yourself.<p class="message sent">Aw, shucks. You flatter me too much. But seriously, I appreciate you keeping our systems safe.<p class=message>Hey, that's what I'm here for. Speaking of which, have you tried that new pizza place that just opened up down the street?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. Is it good?<p class=message>Oh man, it's amazing. They have this spicy pepperoni pizza that's out of this world.<p class="message sent">You had me at spicy. Let's go there later today and grab a slice.<p class=message>Deal. But first, let's get those patches deployed, huh?<p class="message sent">Yep, we better get on that. Thanks again, A. You're a real lifesaver.<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to help out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=233a1fa0-9338-4763-adc4-40b99d36f2ea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
