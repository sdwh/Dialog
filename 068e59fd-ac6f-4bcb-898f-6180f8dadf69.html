How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent message-content">I want to buy some fresh flowers for my sister's birthday!<p class="message received message-content">That's a great idea! What kind of flowers were you thinking of?<p class="message sent message-content">I was thinking of a bouquet of roses, but I'm not really sure what color.<p class="message received message-content">Well, we have a variety of colors. Red is a classic choice, but some people like pink or yellow for a more cheerful look.<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, I think I'll go with pink then. Can you put together a nice bouquet for me?<p class="message received message-content">Of course! We have a new shipment that just arrived today, so all of our flowers are extra fresh.<p class="message sent message-content">That's perfect. By the way, do you have any recommendations for a vase to go with the flowers?<p class="message received message-content">Sure, we have some really cute ceramic ones that would look great with the pink roses.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds good. I'll take the pink roses and a vase then.<p class="message received message-content">Great! Would you like me to wrap them up for you?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes please, and could you include a card as well?<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely. What message should I write on the card?<p class="message sent message-content">"Happy Birthday, sis! Have a wonderful day. Love, your favorite sibling."<p class="message received message-content">That's very sweet. I'll write that down for you. Here are your flowers and vase, and the total comes to $30.<p class="message sent message-content">Thank you so much! My sister is going to love this.<p class="message received message-content">It was my pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=068e1243-245c-408a-916c-6ce4ad0b65fa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
