I'm trying to fix this harvester but I can't seem to figure out what's wrong with it.<p class=message>Let me take a look. Hmm, it looks like a loose belt. Have you checked that?<p class="message sent">Oh, I haven't. Thanks for pointing that out!<p class=message>No problem. I'm always happy to help out fellow mechanics. So, where are you from?<p class="message sent">I'm originally from the Midwest but I've been travelling all around for work. How about you?<p class=message>I'm from the West Coast. I love the outdoors and the scenic views here on the hills. It's quite peaceful.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's definitely a change of pace from the city life. I've been enjoying it too. Do you have any favorite hobby outside of work?<p class=message>Actually, I love hiking and camping. There are so many beautiful trails around here.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! I haven't gone hiking yet but I've always wanted to try. Maybe you can recommend some beginner-friendly trails?<p class=message>Sure thing! We can definitely plan a trip together sometime.<p class="message sent">That sounds fun! Thanks for the help with the repair and for the hiking recommendation. I appreciate it.<p class=message>Anytime, my friend. It's always nice meeting other people who share the same interests.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=509e33bb-0b62-4f24-a09a-a206f172d3a4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
