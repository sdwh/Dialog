What brings you here today?<p class="message sent">Thanks for seeing me, A. I've got some concerns about my legal situation.<p class=message>Of course. Let's get started. But first, can I offer you a cup of coffee?<p class="message sent">Oh, don't mind if I do. Thank you!<p class=message>So, what's on your mind?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm in a bit of trouble with the law. Long story short, I've been accused of stealing a traffic sign.<p class=message>(chuckles) That'sâ€¦ unusual. Do you mind sharing more details?<p class="message sent">(sheepishly) It was a dare from my buddies. I know it was stupid, but I didn't think I'd actually get caught.<p class=message>I understand. Well, the first thing we need to do is assess the evidence against you. Then, we'll go from there.<p class="message sent">Great. Do you have any experience with cases like mine?<p class=message>I've been practicing law for over a decade, so I've seen my fair share of bizarre cases. But stealing a traffic sign is definitely a first for me.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, I guess it's not your typical crime.<p class=message>Well, the good news is that you came to the right lawyer. I'll do everything in my power to get the best outcome for you.<p class="message sent">I really appreciate that, A. I just want to put this whole thing behind me.<p class=message>Understandably so. Let's get to work then, shall we?<p class="message sent">Let's do it! And thanks again for the coffee.<p class=message>Always happy to offer some hospitality. Now, let's dig into your case.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=67870d37-fdea-4b31-a37d-4bd2a84958bb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
