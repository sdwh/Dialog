I'm excited to explore the fish market here in Nagasaki.<p class="message sent">Hi A! I'm glad you're enjoying your stay in Nagasaki. This fish market is famous for its fresh catch.<p class=message>Awesome! I'm looking forward to cooking with fresh ingredients. What should we choose here?<p class="message sent">How about we start with some local fish? This is Saba, a type of mackerel we use in most Japanese dishes.<p class=message>That sounds great! How do you cook it?<p class="message sent">One popular dish is Saba no Shioyaki, which is grilled with salt. It's simple, but the flavor is fantastic.<p class=message>Can I help? I'm excited to learn some local cooking techniques.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Let's go to my friend's cooking class after we choose our ingredients.<p class=message>That sounds like a fun idea. Oh, look at these plump scallops! Have you tried them before?<p class="message sent">Yes, if you like, we can make Hotate no Gratinee, which is baked scallops with cheese and breadcrumbs.<p class=message>Yum! Let's add them to our basket. This fish market is like a foodie's heaven.<p class="message sent">It sure is. I'm glad that you're enjoying the local cuisine. What's next on our list?<p class=message>How about some fresh vegetables? We can make a salad with them and pair it with our fish.<p class="message sent">Good idea! I recommend this green vegetable, which is called Kogomi. It's a fern shoot that is grown in the wild.<p class=message>Oh, that's interesting. I've never heard of it before. It looks fresh and packed with nutrients.<p class="message sent">It is! Let's add it to our basket. We're all set now. Let's head to the cooking class!<p class=message>I can't wait to cook with you and learn some new techniques. Thanks for showing me around, B.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. It's always fun to share my love for local cuisine with visitors like you. Let's have a great time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5a889248-955e-4f22-9e9f-90304aab0d70.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
