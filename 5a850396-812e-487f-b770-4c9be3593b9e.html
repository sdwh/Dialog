Are you excited to cook some local delicacies today?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! I heard this place is famous for their pork leg vermicelli, so I can't wait to try it.<p class=message>Don't worry, we'll have it up and running in no time. But first, let's prep the pineapple cakes.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love those! I used to eat them all the time as a kid.<p class=message>That's great to hear. We'll make sure we do them justice. Do you remember how they're supposed to taste?<p class="message sent">Well, they should be flaky on the outside and have a sweet, juicy filling.<p class=message>Perfect! That's exactly what we're going for. Let's get started then.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Hey, have you ever tried making any other local snacks?<p class=message>Actually, I have. I used to make this really delicious taro ball dessert at my previous job.<p class="message sent">Really? That sounds interesting. Maybe we could add it to the menu here.<p class=message>Sure, I'd love to! It's not very complicated, and the purple color of the taro makes it look really pretty.<p class="message sent">Great, let's start brainstorming some ideas for how to incorporate it. We could do a taro ball soup, or maybe even a taro milk tea.<p class=message>That all sounds delicious. I can't wait to experiment and see what we come up with.<p class="message sent">Me too! It's always fun to try new things, especially when it comes to food.<p class=message>Definitely. And speaking of food, I think our pineapple cakes are ready to go in the oven.<p class="message sent">Awesome! Let's hope they turn out just as good as the ones we used to have as kids.<p class=message>Fingers crossed. But even if they don't, we'll keep trying until we get it right.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit! With our skills combined, there's no snack we can't conquer.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5a81ab68-5a74-47e1-b91f-e925c5e6dcaf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
