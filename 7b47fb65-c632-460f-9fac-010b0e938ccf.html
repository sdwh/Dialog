Do you know any good places to see in London?<p class="message sent">Of course, there are so many! What kind of things do you like?<p class=message>Well, I really enjoy museums and history.<p class="message sent">Oh, then you must visit the British Museum. It's free and has amazing artifacts from all over the world.<p class=message>That sounds great! Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, many times. I like to bring my kids there on weekends.<p class=message>That's lovely. What about food? Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely go to Borough Market. It's a huge food market with vendors selling everything from fresh produce to gourmet street food.<p class=message>Yum, I'll make sure to check that out. Do you have a favorite restaurant in London?<p class="message sent">The Duck & Waffle is a must-visit. It's on the 40th floor of a skyscraper and has breathtaking views of the city. Plus, their signature dish is delicious.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. Thanks for all the suggestions!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. London has so much to offer, I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time.<p class=message>I'm excited to explore. By the way, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh, about 10 years now. It's a fun job, you get to meet so many interesting people.<p class=message>I bet. Do you have any crazy stories from your time driving?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Oh, plenty. But one time, a passenger accidentally left their pet parrot in the backseat. I had to chase them down the street to give it back.<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious. I'll have to make sure I don't leave anything behind.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Don't worry, it happens all the time. But if you do, just give me a call and I'll make sure to return it to you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7b42ca30-382d-442d-92f1-4889361d91a7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
