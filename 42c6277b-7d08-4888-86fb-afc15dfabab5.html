What could it be?<p class=message>Here, I got you this digital watch as a farewell gift.<p class="message sent">Wow, thank you! This is so thoughtful of you.<p class=message>I figured since we've spent so much time together, it'd be nice to have a little reminder of that.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. It's such a sweet gesture.<p class=message>Plus, now you'll always know what time it is no matter where you are in the world!<p class="message sent">Haha, very true. It'll definitely come in handy when I'm in different time zones.<p class=message>I hope it's not too cheesy, but I set one of the alarms to go off at the time we first met.<p class="message sent">Aww, that's adorable! You really thought of everything.<p class=message>Well, I wanted to make sure this watch would be more than just a practical tool.<p class="message sent">You definitely succeeded in that. I'll cherish it forever.<p class=message>And who knows, maybe one day we'll have the chance to reunite and reminisce about all our adventures.<p class="message sent">I would love that. Until then, I'll always have this watch to keep our memories close.<p class=message>Keep it safe, okay? It's just a small symbol of our friendship, but it means a lot to me.<p class="message sent">I will, don't worry. Thank you again. You're such a helpful assistant... I mean, friend.<p class=message>Hah! I'll take both titles. You're pretty great yourself.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Safe travels and keep in touch!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=42c16d26-09be-423a-af3a-d38883345d95.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
