Can you please have a seat?<p class="message sent">Good morning, officer. Sure thing.<p class=message>So, we're here today to ask you a few questions regarding last night's incident.<p class="message sent">Incident? What incident?<p class=message>A convenience store was robbed at 11 pm, and eyewitnesses reported seeing someone matching your description leaving the scene.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. Well, officer, I can assure you that I was at home all night watching Netflix.<p class=message>Can you tell me what you were watching?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I was watching the new season of "Stranger Things". It's pretty good, you should definitely check it out.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. So, do you have anyone who can corroborate your story?<p class="message sent">My girlfriend was with me, but I'm afraid she's not a big "Stranger Things" fan.<p class=message>Do you mind if we contact her to verify your alibi?<p class="message sent">Not at all. Go ahead, officer.<p class=message>Alright, we'll do that. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to add?<p class="message sent">Just that I'm innocent, officer. I may look suspicious, but I swear I had nothing to do with the robbery.<p class=message>We'll make sure to investigate thoroughly, sir. Thanks for your cooperation.<p class="message sent">No problem, officer. I hope you catch the real culprit soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cbcfc03a-cf9a-48b4-8ad9-41fc64af53f4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
