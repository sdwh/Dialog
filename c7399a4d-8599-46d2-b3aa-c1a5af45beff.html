Are you ready to take some fantastic shots of the Statue of Liberty?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. This monument has been on my bucket list for years.<p class=message>Awesome! This iconic statue was gifted to the US by the French in 1886 as a symbol of freedom and democracy.<p class="message sent">I never knew that. Thank you for sharing that piece of history!<p class=message>No worries. Now, where would you like me to stand so you can capture the perfect shot?<p class="message sent">How about over there where the sun is shining on the statue's face?<p class=message>Excellent choice! Now let's strike a pose and give those cameras a big smile.<p class="message sent">I'm not much of a model, but I'll try my best.<p class=message>Don't worry, just have fun with it. Oh, and don't forget to take advantage of the stunning New York skyline as the backdrop.<p class="message sent">Wow, this view is breathtaking. I'll definitely be adding this photo to my Instagram.<p class=message>Of course! And speaking of photos, have you heard of the famous Lady Liberty selfie?<p class="message sent">No, what is that?<p class=message>It's pretty simple. All you have to do is angle your camera up towards the statue's face like this, and then take a selfie with the statue in the background.<p class="message sent">Oh, I get it. Let me give it a try.<p class=message>Perfect! That's one for the photo album. Thanks for choosing our tour, and enjoy the rest of your time in New York City.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for the amazing experience. I'll definitely recommend this tour to my friends.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c738bc5e-8250-4507-a48c-227c015c942c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
