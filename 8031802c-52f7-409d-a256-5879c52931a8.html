Can you help me with something?<p class="message sent">Of course, what do you need help with?<p class=message>I've never used a life jacket before, and I'm a bit nervous about it. Can you show me how to use one?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! First, you want to make sure that the life jacket is a good fit for you. It should be snug, but still allow you to move your arms and breathe easily.<p class=message>Okay, got it. What do I do next?<p class="message sent">Next, buckle the straps and make sure they're secure. Then, pull on the cords to inflate the life jacket. If it doesn't inflate, blow into the tube.<p class=message>Oh, I see. How do I know if it's working properly?<p class="message sent">Well, if it's inflated, then it's working properly. But to be sure, there should be a whistle attached to the life jacket. If you blow into it and it sounds loud, then it's working.<p class=message>Okay, thanks so much for your help! I feel a lot better about it now.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Do you have any other questions?<p class=message>Actually, yeah. I've always wondered - can you use a life jacket as a floatation device to relax on in the water?<p class="message sent">Haha, well, technically yes, but it's not the most comfortable thing in the world. Life jackets are designed for safety, not for lounging.<p class=message>Fair enough, just had to ask. Thanks again for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Have a great flight. And remember, in the unlikely event of an emergency, your life jacket is here to keep you safe.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=802cdec4-da1c-4539-b67c-0110196dedcf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
