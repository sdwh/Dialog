I'll make sure to feature it on our social media.<p class=message>Speaking of social media, have we been getting a lot of online orders lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have!

By the way, have you tried our new chocolate croissants? They're to die for.<p class="message sent">Yes, I did, and I have to say, they're one of the best I've had in a while. You really do have a knack for creating top-notch pastries.<p class=message>Thank you so much, Boss. I really enjoy baking and making people happy.<p class="message sent">And we enjoy having you as part of our team. You’ve really elevated the quality of our baked goods.<p class=message>That means a lot, Boss. I'm here to contribute to the success of our business as much as I can.<p class="message sent">And we appreciate it.
