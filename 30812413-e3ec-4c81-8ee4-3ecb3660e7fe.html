I'm excited to try it out.<p class=message>Great, let's get started. Can you prepare the ingredients while I check the measurements?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, I'll get right on it.<p class="message sent">Ok, all set. What's the next step?<p class=message>We need to mix the dry ingredients first, then add the wet ingredients slowly.<p class="message sent">Got it. Should I use an electric mixer or mix it by hand?<p class=message>I suggest mixing by hand to get a better feel for the consistency.<p class="message sent">That sounds reasonable. By the way, have you tried any of the cute cafes nearby?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've heard good things about them. Have you?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I went to this one that had adorable animal-shaped desserts. It was too cute to eat.<p class=message>Ha! I should try it out. Have you tried any of the street food yet?<p class="message sent">Of course! The fried chicken and tteokbokki are the best.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll have to give it a try too.<p class="message sent">Definitely! So, how long should we let the dough rest before baking it?<p class=message>It should rest for about an hour to rise.<p class="message sent">Got it. Then we can start shaping it into our desired form and pop it in the oven.<p class=message>Yes, and then we can sample our creation. I'm excited to see how it turns out!<p class="message sent">Me too! And maybe we can try out some Korean drinks to go with it.<p class=message>Sounds like a great plan. Let's finish up and head out to explore more of the city.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3080a95a-efea-47f0-ad73-922669e474c5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
