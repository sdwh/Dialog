I'm here for the cashier position at the hotel, as advertised.<p class="message sent">Good morning, please have a seat. Can you tell me a bit about your experience working in a hotel?<p class=message>Sure! I actually worked at a hotel in Japan for several years, where I was responsible for managing transactions for guests.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. How about your language skills? Many of our guests are international travelers.<p class=message>Yes, I can speak Japanese and English fluently, and I'm also learning Mandarin. I believe I can communicate well with our guests.<p class="message sent">Excellent. Can you tell me about a time when you dealt with a difficult customer or a challenging situation?<p class=message>Of course. One time, a guest was upset because their room wasn't ready on time. I apologized and listened to their concerns. I then worked with the cleaning staff to quickly get the room ready and offered a complimentary beverage while they waited.<p class="message sent">That shows good problem-solving skills. How comfortable are you with computer systems and operating cash registers?<p class=message>I'm quite familiar with computers, and have previous experience using various software programs for record keeping and such.<p class="message sent">Wonderful. Lastly, can you tell me what you believe makes excellent customer service?<p class=message>To me, excellent customer service means being attentive, approachable, and empathetic. Providing a personal touch can go a long way in making guests feel welcome and satisfied with their stay.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. I believe you're a strong candidate for the position. We'll be in touch with you soon.<p class=message>Thank you, B. I appreciate the opportunity and look forward to hearing from you.
