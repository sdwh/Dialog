May I see your passport and boarding pass, please?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Here you go.<p class=message>Thank you. So, are you excited about your trip?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! I’ve never been to New Zealand before. And I heard the scenery is amazing!<p class=message>It is! I’ve been there a few times myself. Are you a nervous flyer?<p class="message sent">A little bit, but I’m trying to relax. Any tips?<p class=message>Well, some people find it helpful to distract themselves with music or a good book. Or you could always try talking to your seat mate – sometimes that helps, too.<p class="message sent">That’s a good idea! Do you have any book recommendations?<p class=message>Depends on what you like to read. Are you into romance, mystery, or adventure?<p class="message sent">I usually read romance novels.<p class=message>Ah, I see. I’m not much of a romance reader myself, but I’ve heard “The Notebook” is a classic.<p class="message sent">Really? I’ve seen the movie but never read the book. I’ll have to check it out!<p class=message>Yes, it’s supposed to be great. Now, let’s see. You’re seated in 17B, which is just three rows behind the emergency exit. Do you have any questions about the safety procedures?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. Can you remind me of what to do in case of an emergency landing?<p class=message>Of course! If we have to make an emergency landing, stay calm and follow the instructions of the flight attendants. Brace yourself in your seat, with your hands on your head and your feet flat on the floor. But don’t worry, we’re trained to handle all kinds of situations.<p class="message sent">Thanks for letting me know. I feel better now.<p class=message>You’re welcome. And don’t hesitate to call a flight attendant if you need anything during the flight. We’re here to make your trip as comfortable as possible.<p class="message sent">Great, thank you! I can’t wait to get to New Zealand.<p class=message>Me too! Have a safe and enjoyable trip. You’ll be boarding in just a few minutes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e741e523-1e5c-44e4-bed0-3fb638df9b3b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
