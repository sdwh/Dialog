Thank you for having me today.<p class="message sent">Hi there, thanks for coming in. Can you tell me a bit about your experience as a doorman?<p class=message>Sure. I worked at a luxury hotel in New York for two years, where I was responsible for greeting guests, assisting with their luggage, and hailing taxis.<p class="message sent">Great, that sounds like great experience. What would you do if a guest approached the hotel with a complaint?<p class=message>Well, I would remain calm and professional. I'd carefully listen to their complaint and do my best to offer a solution, whether it's finding a manager to speak with them or coordinating with other staff to address the issue.<p class="message sent">Very good. And what would you say is your greatest strength as a doorman?<p class=message>I believe my attentiveness is my greatest strength. I make an effort to remember guests' names and any specific requests they have, so they always feel welcome and taken care of.<p class="message sent">Excellent. Lastly, what do you think makes a hotel doorman stand out from others?<p class=message>I think someone who is personable and approachable is key. A doorman should make guests feel comfortable and welcome as soon as they arrive, setting the tone for a great stay.<p class="message sent">Thank you for your time and answers. We'll be in touch soon.<p class=message>Thank you. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ee64679b-bb25-40dc-8d70-fe89bd256411.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
