How do you go about testing website speed and functionality as a website tester?<p class="message sent">Hey, nice to meet you! Our testing team usually uses performance analysis tools like Google's PageSpeed Insights and GTMetrix to get a comprehensive analysis of website performance.<p class=message>That's great. I usually use browser developer tools to test website speed, but those tools seem more analytical. What factors do you look at when testing website speed?<p class="message sent">We usually check the load time, page size, and request count for a website. Those are the key indicators of web page performance.<p class=message>That's really interesting. Do you have any tips on how I can optimize my code to improve website performance?<p class="message sent">Yes, minimizing HTTP requests is a good way to improve website speed. You can also compress image files, minify your CSS and JavaScript, and enable browser caching.<p class=message>Ah, those are some great tips. Thanks for sharing that with me. So how often do you test website performance?<p class="message sent">We usually test website performance after every site update, but we also do regular checks to ensure everything is working optimally.<p class=message>That's important. I'm sure that helps with maintaining a quality website. So, what have you found to be the most common issues with website performance?<p class="message sent">Well, we've found that unnecessarily large images, poor server response times, and bloated code are some of the common issues that affect website performance.<p class=message>I see. Those are definitely things to watch out for. Thanks for that helpful information.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Do you have any other questions or concerns about website performance testing?<p class=message>No, that's very informative. Thanks for taking the time to discuss this with me.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It was nice talking to you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0f1b33b6-6c4c-4a40-840d-e8f4a2dafc2c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
