How about you?<p class=message>Same here. I've been mixing drinks left and right.<p class="message sent">What's the most popular drink tonight?<p class=message>Definitely the margarita. It seems like everyone wants one.<p class="message sent">I'm glad we're in Texas, where margaritas are practically a staple.<p class=message>No kidding. Have you tried our new jalape√±o margarita?<p class="message sent">Not yet. Is it spicy?<p class=message>Just a little kick. Want me to make you one?<p class="message sent">Sure, why not?<p class="message sent">Mmm, that's really good! You have to teach me how to make it.<p class=message>It's easy. I'll show you after we close up.<p class="message sent">Thanks! So, have you heard any good jokes lately?<p class=message>Not really, but I did see a biker walk into a bar yesterday with a parrot on his shoulder.<p class="message sent">Really? What happened next?<p class=message>The bartender said, "Wow, that's cool! Where did you get him?"<p class="message sent">And the parrot said...?<p class=message>"In Mexico. There's lots of them down there."<p class=message>Speaking of Mexico, have you ever been there?<p class="message sent">No, but I've always wanted to go. Especially to try authentic tacos.<p class=message>Oh man, you have to go! I went last summer and the food was amazing.<p class="message sent">Any recommendations?<p class=message>Definitely try the street tacos. The ones with al pastor are my all-time favorite.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! I'll have to add that to my travel bucket list.<p class=message>Last call, folks!<p class="message sent">Well, that's our cue to start cleaning up.<p class=message>Yep. Let's make it quick so we can go get some tacos ourselves.<p class="message sent">Deal. Thanks for working with me tonight, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B. You were awesome as always.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ea688f32-9ec1-49d2-ad3e-543eb8303f0a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
