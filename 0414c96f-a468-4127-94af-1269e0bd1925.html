Why do you ask?<p class=message>I'm just curious. They say it's important for businesses to stay ahead of the game.<p class="message sent">For real? I had no idea.<p class=message>Yup, it's all about protecting your company's information from any potential threats.<p class="message sent">That sounds legit. But how do you even begin to monitor and audit for risks?<p class=message>Well, first you gotta identify any potential risks and then assess the likelihood and impact of those risks.<p class="message sent">Okay, okay. And after you identify and assess the risks, what's next?<p class=message>You gotta develop a risk management plan and implement it, and then regularly review and update it.<p class="message sent">I see. And what's the deal with the auditing?<p class=message>Auditing is basically a check-in to make sure that everything in your risk management plan is working as it should be.<p class="message sent">Gotcha. It's like a safety net to make sure nothing gets overlooked.<p class=message>Exactly. It's always better to be safe than sorry.<p class="message sent">For sure. So, do you think our company needs to implement ISO 27001?<p class=message>Well, that's up for a discussion. But it's definitely something worth considering.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'll bring it up at the next meeting.<p class=message>Great idea. It's always worth taking the time to invest in our company's security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0412d9c2-3c03-4f44-be51-57795c23101b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
