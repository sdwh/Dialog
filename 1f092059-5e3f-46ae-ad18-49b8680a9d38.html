These machines seem to always need some sort of attention.<p class="message sent">Tell me about it. Just yesterday, I spent an hour trying to fix one of the motors.<p class=message>Did you get it working in the end?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but I could have done without the headache.<p class=message>I know how you feel. At least we have job security, right?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, that's one way to look at it.<p class=message>Hey, have you noticed that peculiar smell coming from the ventilation system?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been trying to pinpoint the source. I think it might be a buildup of oil and grease.<p class=message>Gross. But at least that's an easy fix. We just need to clean out the vents.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'll make sure to add that to the maintenance checklist.<p class=message>Hey, did you hear about the new guy who just started working here?<p class="message sent">No, I didn't. What's he like?<p class=message>Seems like a decent guy. He's from out of town and just moved here.<p class="message sent">Well, I'll have to introduce myself and make him feel welcome.<p class=message>That's a good idea. We could use some fresh blood around here.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, the more the merrier.<p class=message>Alright, I'm going to go grab some coffee before we dive back into the maintenance.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. You want to check out the new donut shop down the street?<p class=message>Donuts and coffee? You know the way to my heart.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Let's go then. We deserve a little break.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f08c86f-93c2-4941-85f7-e6a70686dfc3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
