How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I’m doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I’m doing well, thanks! I’m excited to work on some delicious pastries to pair with your coffee today.<p class="message sent">That sounds wonderful! What kind of pastries do you have in mind?<p class=message>I was thinking of making some mini tartlets filled with fresh fruit and a light cream cheese filling. And maybe some chocolate croissants too.<p class="message sent">Yum! That sounds like the perfect addition to our coffee menu. I’m working on a new flavored latte today, would you like to try it?<p class=message>Of course! What’s the flavor you’re experimenting with?<p class="message sent">I’m trying out a lavender honey latte. It’s a bit sweet but also has a floral taste to it.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. I think it would pair well with the mini tartlets.<p class="message sent">I agree! Let’s get started on making them. Do you have any tips on making the perfect tartlet crust?<p class=message>Yes, make sure the butter is super cold before you start mixing it. And remember not to overwork the dough or it might become too tough.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice! And I’ll make sure to froth the milk extra well for the latte.<p class=message>Great teamwork! We’re going to make these customers very happy with our delicious treats.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And I’m already looking forward to trying out new flavors and recipes with you in the future.<p class=message>Me too, I’m always up for experimenting and trying out new things.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d2825f14-b615-4987-a6b0-61d5c9a091c7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
