Please have a seat.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Can I have a cup of coffee?<p class=message>Sorry, we don't have a coffee bar here. So, what brings you to our office today?<p class="message sent">I'm here to turn myself in. I stole a car last night.<p class=message>Well, thank you for being honest. Can you give me your details so I can prepare your paperwork?<p class="message sent">Sure. My name is John, John Smith.<p class=message>Okay, John Smith. May I know why you stole a car?<p class="message sent">Honestly, officer, it was just a joyride. I didn't mean any harm.<p class=message>(chuckles) A joyride? That's not something you hear every day. Mind telling me more about this joyride?<p class="message sent">Well, it was getting late and I was bored, and the car keys were just sitting there in the ignition. So, I thought, why not?<p class=message>(shakes head) I see. Did you know it's against the law to take someone else's property without permission?<p class="message sent">(shrugs) Yeah, I didn't think about that at the time.<p class=message>You're lucky you didn't get caught by the police during your joyride. Anyways, I'll prepare your paperwork and we'll have to detain you for the meantime.<p class="message sent">Alright, officer. Can I at least have a book or something to pass the time?<p class=message>(smirks) Sorry John, it's not a hotel. But you're more than welcome to practice meditation or yoga.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Okay, thanks for the suggestion. I'll keep that in mind.<p class=message>Alright, John. Have a good day and don't hesitate to call us if you need anything.<p class="message sent">Thank you, officer. You have a good day too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=41426131-28d1-4aba-b162-bff6f0ae7ae1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
