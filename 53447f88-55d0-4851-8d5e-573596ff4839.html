I'm headed to Los Angeles, how's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">Hey! My day's just got started, now that I get to drive someone fun like you. Los Angeles, huh? That's my city!<p class=message>I'm excited to check out all the cool places they have there. Have you ever been to the Sunset Strip?<p class="message sent">Oh, a lot of times, I could take you to see the Whisky A Go Go, the Viper Room, you name it. That's where the party's at!<p class=message>That sounds awesome! Speaking of music, what do you like listening to while driving?<p class="message sent">I love good rock n' roll, but sometimes I play classical music too. It's elegant, like a French poodle.<p class=message>Haha, that's an interesting comparison! You must have some crazy taxi stories, huh?<p class="message sent">Oh, let me tell you about this one time when I picked up a guy in a two-foot tall sombrero, and he refused to take it off. We got some looks on the freeway!<p class=message>That's too funny! Maybe I should've brought a sombrero too. Do you have any favorite restaurants in LA?<p class="message sent">You can't go wrong with In-n-Out Burger, but I also love the Korean BBQ places. If you're feeling daring, I know a place that serves ostrich meat!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds exotic. I might take you up on that recommendation. Anyway, thanks for the ride, it's been a blast so far!<p class="message sent">Pleasure's all mine, buddy. Have fun in LA, and remember to enjoy the ride, not just the destination.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=533eae2e-1977-4acd-b565-7d4f63c0aabd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
