What brings you out to the park today?<p class="message sent">Hi grandpa! I just needed some fresh air and exercise. It's such a beautiful day.<p class=message>It sure is. I used to come to this park all the time when I was younger. It brings back good memories.<p class="message sent">Really? What kind of things did you do here?<p class=message>Oh, I used to play a lot of baseball and have picnics with my friends. We'd also go fishing in the pond over there. It was a lot of fun.<p class="message sent">That sounds like fun. Do you still play baseball?<p class=message>No, I'm a bit too old for that now. But I do like to take walks around the park and feed the ducks.<p class="message sent">That's cool. Hey, have you heard of Pokémon Go?<p class=message>Pokémon what? No, I can't say I have.<p class="message sent">It's this game that you play on your phone. You walk around and catch Pokémon in real life.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. You kids and your technology!<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah. Want to try it out with me?<p class=message>I don't know if I can keep up with you young whippersnappers, but I'll give it a shot!<p class="message sent">Alright, let's go catch some Pokémon!<p class=message>This is certainly an interesting way to spend an afternoon. I feel like a kid again!<p class="message sent">Haha, see grandpa? Technology isn't all bad.<p class=message>I suppose you're right. Now let's see if we can catch that Pikachu over there! I've got my walking shoes on, let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e7635a72-da84-432b-ab49-f9d63740b0bb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
