Thank you for leading us up here, B.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A! I love showing people the beauty of Tasmania's wilderness.<p class=message>I can't believe how clear the sky is today. It's not often you get such good visibility up here.<p class="message sent">It definitely makes the hike worth it. Speaking of which, are you feeling okay? Not too tired?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks. It's a bit of a challenge, but I'm enjoying it. How about you, B? You must be used to these hikes by now.<p class="message sent">Haha, well, I've definitely done my fair share of them! But every time is a little different. That's what keeps it interesting for me.<p class=message>Do you ever get nervous about leading hikes like this? I mean, it's pretty remote out here.<p class="message sent">Sure, there's always a bit of risk involved. That's why I take safety seriously and make sure everyone is prepared. But honestly, it's worth it to show people what our amazing wilderness has to offer.<p class=message>Agreed. And it's nice to unplug from modern life for a while, too. I've barely looked at my phone all day!<p class="message sent">That's what I like to hear! Disconnecting is essential sometimes. Speaking of which, want to take a moment to appreciate the view in silence?<p class=message>Definitely. Let's do it. [pause] Ah, that was nice. Okay, I'm ready to head back down now.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Let's get going! I have a surprise for you guys at the end of the trail.<p class=message>Ooh, now I'm even more curious! Thanks again for everything, B.<p class="message sent">Not a problem, A. It's been a pleasure hiking with you today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fa8d7430-c63c-4f2d-8a12-552ac209dab7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
