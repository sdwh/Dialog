I see you're deep in thought. What are you studying?<p class="message sent">Hi, Teacher A! I'm studying for my calculus exam next week. It's going to be a tough one.<p class=message>Calculus can be tricky, but I know you'll do great. Have you tried using any study apps or flashcards?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been using a few apps to practice. But sometimes I just need a break from staring at my phone.<p class=message>I completely understand. Do you want some reading suggestions? I just finished this mystery novel about a detective who solves a crime in a library.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting! What's the title of the book and who's the author?<p class=message>It's called "The Body in the Library" by Agatha Christie. She's a classic author who's written a lot of mystery novels.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'll definitely check it out! Have you read any good books lately?<p class=message>Yes, I just read "Where the Crawdads Sing" by Delia Owens. It's a beautiful story about a young girl who grows up in the marshes of North Carolina.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like a great coming-of-age book. I'll add it to my reading list.<p class=message>Definitely do! And if you need any help with your calculus, don't hesitate to come see me during office hours.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Teacher A! You're always so helpful. I appreciate it.<p class=message>Of course, anytime. Now, let's get back to studying. We've got this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=792eeabc-b1f5-45c3-b35e-5449f44ac214.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
