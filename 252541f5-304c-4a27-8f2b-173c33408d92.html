Welcome to our tea house. What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">Hello there! I would love to try your most popular tea and a traditional Chinese pastry.<p class=message>Sure thing! Our most popular tea is the Long Jing and our traditional pastry is our egg custard tart. Would you like me to prepare that for you?<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! I hope it's as delicious as it sounds.<p class=message>It definitely is! Our egg custard tart recipe has been passed down for generations. So, what made you interested in tea?<p class="message sent">I've always loved the art and ceremony of tea. It's such a beautiful way to take a moment of pause and appreciate the beauty of the world around us.<p class=message>That's so lovely. We share a similar philosophy with our pastry making. We believe that every bite should be beautiful and bring joy.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. I'm really excited to try your egg custard tart. How do you make it so delectable?<p class=message>It's all in the technique. We bake the crust until it's golden brown, and then we fill it with the perfect balance of eggs, sugar, and cream. It's light, sweet, and melts in your mouth.<p class="message sent">Mmm, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. And how do you brew your Long Jing tea?<p class=message>We like to keep things simple and let the tea speak for itself. We use water that's just below boiling point and let the tea steep for about two minutes. It's delicate and will leave you feeling refreshed.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. Thank you for the recommendation. I can't wait to try both!<p class=message>You're welcome. It's our pleasure to share our passion with our guests. I hope you enjoy the tea and pastry.<p class="message sent">I'm sure I will! Cheers to a beautiful afternoon filled with exquisite flavors and aromas.<p class=message>Cheers! We are glad to have you here. Let us know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=25251449-7d8c-40e6-92ec-152c4a32fbdc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
