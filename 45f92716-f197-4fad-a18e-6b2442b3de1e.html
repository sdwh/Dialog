You'll love it there.<p class=message>Yeah, I've always wanted to go there. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. I actually spent a few years living there.

I'm looking forward to exploring the city and trying out some new restaurants.<p class="message sent">Oh, there are so many good restaurants in Miami.

Some of the best seafood I've ever had was in Miami.<p class=message>That's good to know. What other things would you recommend doing while we're there?<p class="message sent">Well, you definitely have to check out South Beach. It's one of the most popular spots in Miami. And if you're into art, the Wynwood Walls are a must-see.<p class=message>Those both sound great. I'll definitely add them to my list.<p class="message sent">You should also try some water activities like kayaking or paddleboarding. The water in Miami is really clear and beautiful.<p class=message>That sounds like fun.
