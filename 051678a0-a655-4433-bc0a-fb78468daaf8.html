Nice to meet you, B, the chef.<p class="message sent message-content">Hi A, it's great to meet you too! I'm excited to learn about the traditional seafood recipes here.<p class="message received message-content">I'm glad to teach you. First, let me show you how to clean and prepare these fresh abalones.<p class="message sent message-content">Wow, these abalones look amazing! I've never seen them so fresh before.<p class="message received message-content">Yes, we catch them daily just a few miles off the coast. Now, slice them thinly and we'll cook them in butter and garlic.<p class="message sent message-content">Mmm, that smells great. What's next?<p class="message received message-content">We'll also make a crispy deep-fried calamari. Have you ever tried it?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I've cooked calamari before, but I'm excited to learn your technique.<p class="message received message-content">Great. First, we'll coat the calamari in a light batter made from flour, egg, and beer. Then we'll deep fry them until crispy.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds delicious! What else can we make?<p class="message received message-content">Let's finish with a traditional seafood chowder. It's made with fresh prawns, mussels, and clams caught right here in our bay.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds amazing! What ingredients do we need?<p class="message received message-content">Just some cream, potatoes, onions, and celery. It's simple but very flavorful.<p class="message sent message-content">I can't wait to try it all! Thank you, A, for teaching me these traditional recipes.<p class="message received message-content">You're welcome, B. It's always great to share our local cuisine with others.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=051361a0-cacd-44d1-8dae-a12ef7e2d8f1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
