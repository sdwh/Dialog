Today we'll be discussing the history behind April Fool's Day.<p class="message sent">Oh, I've always wondered about the origins of that holiday.<p class=message>Well, legend has it that it started in France in the 16th century when they switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. People who were still celebrating the new year in April were considered fools.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. I never knew it had to do with the calendar.<p class=message>Yes, and now it's celebrated all over the world with pranks and practical jokes. Have any of you pulled a good prank before?<p class="message sent">I once convinced my friend that there was a ghost in her house. It was all in good fun, though.<p class=message>That sounds like a classic prank. Did you hear about the time Google announced they were changing their name to Topeka for April Fool's Day?<p class="message sent">No, I missed that one.<p class=message>Yes, it was quite the surprise for many people. But it just goes to show how creative and fun April Fool's Day can be.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm excited to see what pranks my friends will come up with this year.<p class=message>Just remember to keep it harmless and respectful. We don't want anyone getting hurt or offended.<p class="message sent">Of course. Thanks for the reminder.<p class=message>Alright, now let's get back to learning. Who can define the term "irony" for me?<p class="message sent">Ooh, I got this! Irony is when the opposite of what you expect to happen, happens.<p class=message>Very good, B. I think you've got the hang of this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c264b9e8-57fb-40b0-ba9e-4a1e930bb69f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
