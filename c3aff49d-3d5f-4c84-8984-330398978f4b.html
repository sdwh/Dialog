We found so many issues.<p class=message>I know, right? It's a good thing we caught them before they caused any serious problems.<p class="message sent">Definitely. So, how do you suggest we go about fixing the issues?<p class=message>Well, I think we should prioritize the critical issues first and work our way down the list.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. And what about the less severe issues?<p class=message>We can address those over time as we have more resources available.<p class="message sent">Good plan. So, do you have any suggestions on how we can prevent these issues from happening in the first place?<p class=message>One strategy could be to implement strict coding standards and conduct regular code reviews.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a great idea. It'll not only help prevent future issues but also improve the overall quality of our codebase.<p class=message>Exactly. And if we keep our code clean and consistently readable, it'll be easier for other developers to jump in and contribute to the project.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's always easier to work with clean and well-organized code.<p class=message>And one more thing, let's make sure we document everything as we go along. It'll be helpful for future reference and for new members joining the team.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Good documentation saves everyone time and hassle.<p class=message>Well, that's settled then. Let's get to work and fix those issues!<p class="message sent">On it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c3ab9956-8d13-423e-8fdd-5a2ee911ea7d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
