How are you doing?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great! How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing pretty well. So, have you heard about ISO 27001 Change Control?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. It's the process of managing changes to an organization's information security management system.<p class=message>That's right! Have you had any experience with it?<p class="message sent">I've had some experience, but I'd love to learn more about it.<p class=message>Well, it's important to make sure all changes are properly assessed, authorized, and implemented while maintaining the security of the system.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's important to have a well-defined process for implementing changes.<p class=message>Definitely. And it's important to always review and improve the change control process as well.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. I'm sure there must have been some changes in the past that could have been handled better.<p class=message>Yeah, it's always good to learn from past mistakes and improve for the future.<p class="message sent">So true. Hey, have you heard of any recent updates to the ISO 27001 standard?<p class=message>Yes, actually, there were some updates made in 2019. One of the key changes was the introduction of the Annex A.14 control â€“ Information Security Incident Management.<p class="message sent">Ah, interesting. I'll have to read up on that.<p class=message>Definitely. It's always good to stay up-to-date with the latest changes to the standard.<p class="message sent">For sure. Thanks for the helpful information and conversation, A!<p class=message>No problem at all, happy to chat about it anytime.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b0e1e50-667d-4510-acbb-d42a7b62365d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
