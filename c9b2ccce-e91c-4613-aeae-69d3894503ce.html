How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I was thinking about trying some seafood. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Our shrimp scampi is quite popular among our customers. It's made with fresh shrimp in a garlic butter sauce, served over linguine.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. I'll go for the shrimp scampi then.<p class=message>Great choice, sir. Would you like to add a side salad or some breadsticks to your order?<p class="message sent">I'll go for the breadsticks, please.<p class=message>Noted. And how would you like your shrimp scampi cooked, sir?<p class="message sent">I prefer it well-done, please.<p class=message>Understood, sir. Your order will be ready in about 15 minutes. Can I get you anything to drink while you wait?<p class="message sent">How about a glass of red wine?<p class=message>Excellent choice, sir. One glass of red wine coming right up.<p class="message sent">So, how long have you been working here?<p class=message>I've been here for about a year now. But I actually started as a dishwasher before becoming a waiter.<p class="message sent">Oh, wow. That's quite an impressive journey.<p class=message>Thank you, sir. I've always loved working in the hospitality industry.<p class="message sent">Well, you certainly seem to be good at it. By the way, how do you find the time to remember all the menu items and deal with so many customers?<p class=message>Practice, practice, practice. (laughs) But seriously, it's all about having a good memory and excellent multitasking skills.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. It's quite admirable. Well, thank you for taking my order, and I can't wait to try the shrimp scampi.<p class=message>You're welcome, sir. We aim to please. Enjoy your meal.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c9b24ee7-c42e-4a6f-87c8-98a257ad125a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
