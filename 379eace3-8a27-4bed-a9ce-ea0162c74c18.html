I got to pick all kinds of fruits and learned so much about the farming life. How about you A?<p class=message>Well, I was the local farmer who was helping out. It's always fun to see tourists come and enjoy the fruits of our labor.<p class="message sent">That's great! I never appreciated how much hard work goes into growing and harvesting fruits until now.<p class=message>Yeah, it's definitely not as easy as it looks. But it's worth it to see people like you enjoying the fruits of our labor.<p class="message sent">Do you have any tips for picking the best fruits?<p class=message>Of course! First, always look for the biggest and brightest colors. They are the most ripe and flavorful. And second, be gentle when picking so you don't damage the fruit.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tips! I'll keep that in mind for next time.<p class=message>No problem, B! It was great to have you come and join us on the farm.<p class="message sent">I had such a great time, I might just have to come back next season.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! We'll be ready for you with baskets in hand.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=379a9c05-8ecb-4e22-8f5b-f0e0353e6f12.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
