It's a security standard that provides guidelines for information security management.<p class=message>Exactly! And do you know what a firewall is?<p class="message sent">Of course, it's a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.<p class=message>You're absolutely right. So, what do you think are the advantages of having an ISO 27001 Firewall in place?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, it helps protect against hackers and cyber threats.<p class=message>Yes, and it also ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.<p class="message sent">Right, and it can also help companies comply with legal and regulatory requirements.<p class=message>That's true. But it can be a bit complicated to set up and maintain, don't you think?<p class="message sent">Definitely. That's why it's important to have a team of experts who can handle it.<p class=message>Agreed. It's not something you want to mess around with.<p class="message sent">By the way, have you heard about the recent cyber attack on that big company?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What happened?<p class="message sent">Hackers managed to steal a lot of sensitive information and the company had to pay a huge ransom to get it back.<p class=message>Wow, that's scary. That's why it's so important to have good cybersecurity measures in place, like an ISO 27001 Firewall.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's better to be safe than sorry, right?<p class=message>Right. Anyway, thanks for chatting with me about this. I learned a lot!<p class="message sent">No problem, anytime!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=14342ba3-5c01-4c3f-92de-f73c7562aa6b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
