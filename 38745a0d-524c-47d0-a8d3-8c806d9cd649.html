How are you today?<p class="message sent">Hello, A! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, it's always a good day at the café. Speaking of which, have you tried our new blend of coffee beans?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's special about it?<p class=message>It has a rich, chocolatey flavor with a hint of caramel. It's been really popular with our customers.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Maybe I'll have to grab a cup on my break.<p class=message>Definitely do! And while you're at it, why not pair it with one of your freshly baked croissants?<p class="message sent">Good idea. It's always a perfect match. Speaking of baking, have you experimented with any new bread recipes lately?<p class=message>I have. I've been trying out a savory baguette with sun-dried tomatoes and basil. It's been a hit as a sandwich bread.<p class="message sent">Yum! I'll have to try that with some of my homemade pesto.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. We make a great team here at the café, don't we?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's a great feeling knowing that we offer classic French coffee and bread to the people of Strasbourg.<p class=message>Indeed. And it's always nice to see the happy faces of our customers when they take that first bite or sip.<p class="message sent">It definitely is. Well, speaking of happy customers, I better get back to the bread oven.<p class=message>And I should get back to making those lattes. Have a great day, B!<p class="message sent">You too, A! See you later.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=387343b8-545d-436b-8988-2e439aafcce5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
