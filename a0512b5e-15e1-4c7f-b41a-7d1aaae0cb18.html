Nice to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Hi, A. Nice to meet you as well. I'm excited to learn how to make some tasty Spanish desserts.<p class=message>Great! We'll start with a classic - churros!<p class="message sent">Oh, I've heard of those before. How difficult are they to make?<p class=message>Not too difficult if you follow the steps. We'll start with flour, water, salt, and a bit of sugar.<p class="message sent">That sounds easy enough. What's the key to making them perfect?<p class=message>Gotta fry them until they're golden brown and crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. And don't forget the cinnamon sugar!<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds delicious. Do you have any other specialties?<p class=message>Of course! We have flan, which is caramel custard, and turrón, a type of almond nougat.<p class="message sent">I've never tried those before. Can you show me how they're made?<p class=message>Certainly. Flan is made with eggs, sugar, milk, and caramel sauce. Turrón is a little more complicated, but it uses almonds and honey.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like quite the treat. I can't wait to try them all when we're done!<p class=message>Me too. Having a job where I get to make and eat delicious desserts all day definitely has its perks.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a dream job to me. Thanks for showing me the ropes, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. It was my pleasure. Enjoy your sweet treats!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a050dd95-4880-4a1e-9f42-073795fc7292.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
