What do you think, B?<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. I've seen pictures of it before, but in person, it's just breathtaking.<p class=message>It really is. Did you know that the original color of the bridge was supposed to be black and yellow stripes?<p class="message sent">Really? I'm glad they went with the traditional red instead. It's much more eye-catching.<p class=message>Yeah, me too. It's such an iconic landmark in San Francisco. Have you visited any other famous spots?<p class="message sent">I've been to Alcatraz Island and Chinatown so far. What about you?<p class=message>I've been to Fisherman's Wharf and the Museum of Modern Art. The food at Fisherman's Wharf was amazing.<p class="message sent">Oh, I've heard about the clam chowder. I definitely have to try it before I leave.<p class=message>You have to! Also, have you heard of the Lombard Street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What is it?<p class=message>It's a crazy winding street that goes down a steep hill. You should check it out if you have time.<p class="message sent">That sounds like an adventure! Thanks for the recommendation.<p class=message>No problem. I want to make sure you have a great experience in San Francisco. Oh look, we're almost at the end of the bridge.<p class="message sent">What a shame. I could stay here all day.<p class=message>Me too. But don't worry, there are still so many other beautiful sights to see in this city.<p class="message sent">I can't wait! Thanks again for the ride and the great conversation.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4f314204-5b97-45e9-b456-7e023cc78a14.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
