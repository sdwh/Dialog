How can I help you today?<p class=message>I need to go to Boston. Can you take me there?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Hop in and let's go.<p class=message>Thanks. So, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh, about 10 years now. I know these roads like the back of my hand.<p class=message>That's great. Have you seen any interesting things during your time as a driver?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, plenty. Once I had a passenger who tried to pay me with a banana!<p class=message>Ha, that's hilarious! How did you react?<p class="message sent">I just laughed it off and told him he'd have to pay with real money. So, what brings you to Boston?<p class=message>I'm visiting a friend for the weekend.<p class="message sent">That sounds like fun. Have you been to Boston before?<p class=message>No, it's my first time. I'm excited to see the sights.<p class="message sent">Oh, there's plenty to see. The Freedom Trail is a must-visit.<p class=message>That's on my list. And I've heard the seafood is amazing here.<p class="message sent">You've heard right. Have you tried lobster before?<p class=message>No, but I'm looking forward to it.<p class="message sent">You won't be disappointed. It's a Boston specialty.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation. Hey, what's your favorite thing about being a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Meeting interesting people like you, A. It's always a pleasure to chat with passengers and hear their stories.<p class=message>That's such a nice thing to say. Thank you, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. We're almost there, by the way. Can you see the city skyline up ahead?<p class=message>Wow, it looks beautiful. Thanks for the ride, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime. Have a great weekend in Boston!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7b2470dd-1f46-4b31-a092-6d4219f0f85f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
