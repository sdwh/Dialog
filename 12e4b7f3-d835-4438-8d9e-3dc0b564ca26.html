How's business been today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. It's been busy as usual. Our customers just can't get enough of our delicious pastries and coffee.<p class=message>I'm not surprised, considering your sales pitch. You always make everything sound so tempting.<p class="message sent">Ha! Thanks, A. It helps that the pastries practically sell themselves.<p class=message>I have to agree with you there. I love creating new pastry designs each week. It's always exciting to see what our customers will think of next.<p class="message sent">Yes, I've noticed that. Your latest creation, the strawberry tart, has been a real hit with our customers.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear it. It took me a while to perfect the recipe, but it was worth it. It's one of my favourites too.<p class="message sent">It's a good thing we both enjoy what we do, considering the long hours we work.<p class=message>Definitely. I couldn't imagine doing anything else.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, do you fancy a cup of coffee to keep us going?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds great. What blend do you recommend today?<p class="message sent">How about our special blend? It's a mix of Ethiopian and Columbian beans, and it's been a hit with our customers lately.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. And let's try it with the cinnamon Danish pastry.<p class="message sent">Excellent choice! Let me get it for you now.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=12e37555-f5b9-41e4-8c8e-f1409110bbc3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
