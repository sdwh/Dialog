I'm always happy to help a fellow writer out.<p class=message>So, what do you think of the story so far?<p class="message sent">It's great! I really enjoyed reading it. But I do have a few suggestions for some minor tweaks.<p class=message>Sure, what do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, I think we can cut down on some of the dialogue in this scene. It feels a bit repetitive.<p class=message>Ah, I see what you mean. Good catch.<p class="message sent">And in this paragraph, we could add in a little more detail to help the reader visualize the setting.<p class=message>Got it, thank you. Any other areas you think need some work?<p class="message sent">There was one sentence that didn't quite make sense to me. Maybe we can reword it?<p class=message>Absolutely, let's take a look. Oh, I see what you're saying. How about "The sun was so bright it felt like a fist punching me in the face"?<p class="message sent">Ha! That's a great metaphor. I love it.<p class=message>Thanks, I try to keep things interesting. Alright, I think we've addressed everything. Do you have any final thoughts?<p class="message sent">Nope, that's it for me. You did a fantastic job with this piece, A.<p class=message>Thank you, B. Couldn't have done it without your help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=29cbaa48-f7a6-4f00-93e7-7d788dc01463.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
