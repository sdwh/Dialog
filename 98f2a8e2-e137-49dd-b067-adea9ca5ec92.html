Ready to start another day of baking fresh bread and pastries?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Yes, I am! I can't wait to try out the new cinnamon roll recipe we talked about yesterday.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! Let's get started with the bread dough first. I'll measure out the ingredients while you get the mixer ready.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. By the way, did you see the article in the local paper about our shop? They mentioned our croissants were "flakier than the weather report".<p class=message>(laughs) That's great! I'm glad people are enjoying our baked goods. Speaking of croissants, should we make a batch of those too today?<p class="message sent">Definitely! And we can also try out a new flavor for the macarons. How about matcha green tea?<p class=message>Yum, that sounds perfect for our Japanese customers. (pauses) Hey, have you ever thought about making homemade bagels?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I've been practicing my recipe at home. Do you want to give it a try here at the shop?<p class=message>Absolutely! Let's add it to the menu and see how it goes. (pauses) Hey, do you remember that time when we accidentally burned the entire batch of cupcakes but still sold them as "toasted marshmallow flavor"?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yes! And people loved them so much they asked when we were going to make them again.<p class=message>(smiling) We should have more baking mishaps like that then! It could be our new marketing strategy.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I don't know about that, but I do know that we make a great baking team.<p class=message>Agreed! And our customers can't get enough of our freshly baked goods. Another successful day at the shop, my friend.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=98eebd6a-74aa-46ad-9f48-63523cb2e987.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
