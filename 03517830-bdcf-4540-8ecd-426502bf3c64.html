How are you doing today?<p class="message sent message-content">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How about you? How's your week going?<p class="message received message-content">It's going alright so far. I've been busy with classes and assignments, but I think I'm keeping up with everything.<p class="message sent message-content">That's great to hear. How's your coursework been going? Is there anything you'd like to discuss or any questions you have?<p class="message received message-content">Actually, I've been struggling a bit with the readings for my literature class. Do you have any tips for analyzing poetry?<p class="message sent message-content">Of course! Poetry can be tough, but I find it helpful to read through the poem a few times and take note of any repeated words or phrases. It's also important to pay attention to metaphors and symbolism.<p class="message received message-content">That's really helpful advice. Thank you, Professor. On a completely different note, I noticed the new coffee shop on campus has some interesting drinks. Have you tried anything there yet?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I have! I'm a big fan of their matcha latte. Have you tried it?<p class="message received message-content">Not yet, but it sounds tasty. Maybe I'll have to give it a try next time I'm on campus.<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely do! It's a nice treat to have during a long day of classes.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds like a good idea. Well, thank you for the tips on analyzing poetry and for the coffee shop recommendation. I'll talk to you soon, Professor.<p class="message sent message-content">You're welcome, A. Good luck with your coursework!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0339f224-b8af-45d8-86a5-83cac4af69cd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
