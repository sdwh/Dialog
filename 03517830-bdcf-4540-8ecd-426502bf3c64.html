How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How about you? How's your week going?<p class=message>It's going alright so far. I've been busy with classes and assignments, but I think I'm keeping up with everything.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. How's your coursework been going? Is there anything you'd like to discuss or any questions you have?<p class=message>Actually, I've been struggling a bit with the readings for my literature class. Do you have any tips for analyzing poetry?<p class="message sent">Of course! Poetry can be tough, but I find it helpful to read through the poem a few times and take note of any repeated words or phrases. It's also important to pay attention to metaphors and symbolism.<p class=message>That's really helpful advice. Thank you, Professor. On a completely different note, I noticed the new coffee shop on campus has some interesting drinks. Have you tried anything there yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! I'm a big fan of their matcha latte. Have you tried it?<p class=message>Not yet, but it sounds tasty. Maybe I'll have to give it a try next time I'm on campus.<p class="message sent">Definitely do! It's a nice treat to have during a long day of classes.<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea. Well, thank you for the tips on analyzing poetry and for the coffee shop recommendation. I'll talk to you soon, Professor.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A.
