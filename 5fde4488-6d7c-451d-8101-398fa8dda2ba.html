May I know how many are dining with you today?<p class="message sent">Yes, just me. Do you have any recommendations for today's special dish?<p class=message>Our chef's special dish today is the grilled salmon with spinach and lemon butter sauce. It's a must-try.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! I'll have that, please.<p class=message>Great choice. Would you like any sides with that?<p class="message sent">How about roasted potatoes and a side salad?<p class=message>Excellent choice. I'll place your order right away. Would you like anything to drink?<p class="message sent">I'll have a glass of white wine, please.<p class=message>Definitely. Our house chardonnay is quite popular. Would you like to try that?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll trust your judgment.<p class=message>(chuckles) Thank you. Your order will be ready in about 15 minutes. In the meantime, let me know if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Actually, could you recommend a good dessert?<p class=message>Of course. Our crème brûlée is a customer favorite.

I'll be back with your food and wine shortly.<p class="message sent">Thank you very much.<p class=message>Here's your grilled salmon with roasted potatoes and side salad.

Would you like to try the crème brûlée now?<p class="message sent">Yes, please.<p class=message>(brings out the dessert) Here you go. Enjoy!<p class="message sent">(takes a spoonful) Mmm, this is so good. It's creamy and the caramelized topping gives it a nice crunch.<p class=message>I'm glad you like it. Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class="message sent">No, everything was perfect. Thank you for your great service.<p class=message>You're very welcome.
