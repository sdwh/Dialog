I'm Officer A. Can you please state your name for the record?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Officer A. My name is Tony.<p class=message>Alright, Tony. We have some questions for you regarding the robbery at the convenience store on 5th street. Do you know anything about that?<p class="message sent">Robbery? I have no idea what you're talking about. I was just out for a jog.<p class=message>A jog, huh? Is that why you were running with a mask on your face and a bag full of cash in your hand?<p class="message sent">Uh... I didn't think anyone could recognize me that way.<p class=message>Well, you thought wrong. Now, can you tell me why you did it?<p class="message sent">I lost my job, I needed money, and I thought it was an easy way to get some.<p class=message>That's not an excuse, Tony. You're aware that stealing is a crime, right?<p class="message sent">Of course, officer. I'm sorry. I regret what I did.<p class=message>Alright then. Let's get this paperwork done and we'll talk about your options.<p class="message sent">Thank you, officer. I appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem, Tony. Just remember, crime doesn't pay.<p class="message sent">I sure learned my lesson. Can I at least keep the mask as a souvenir?<p class=message>Nice try, Tony. That's evidence and it's going straight to the evidence locker.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c1ec95f4-a6c3-4b2a-98b9-8f3d3c9b574a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
