Thanks for joining me in this meeting today. I was wondering, what do you think would be the best approach to keep our company's network secure?<p class="message sent">Well, first and foremost, we need to ensure that we have strong passwords in place. They should be a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.<p class=message>That's a great point! We should probably consider using a password manager to keep track of all the different passwords we use.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Another way to protect our network is to have a strong firewall in place. That way, we can block any unauthorized access.<p class=message>What about phishing attacks? How can we prevent those from happening?<p class="message sent">We can train our employees on how to recognize phishing emails and how to report suspicious activity. We can also set up filters to block emails that contain certain keywords.<p class=message>That's a good idea! We should also limit access to sensitive data to only those who need it.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And we should make sure that everyone is using the latest software and operating systems. That way, we can patch up any vulnerabilities.<p class=message>For sure! This has been really helpful, B. Do you have any other suggestions for us?<p class="message sent">Just keep in mind that security is an ongoing process. We need to stay up to date on the latest threats and be proactive in protecting our network.<p class=message>That's a great point. Thank you so much for your help, B. Let's make sure to implement these measures to keep our network safe.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cafad096-753f-4217-ad51-e0bcd09a0b33.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
