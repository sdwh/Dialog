I'm excited to work on it. How about you, A?<p class=message>I'm pretty stoked too. But, I must admit that I find Razor Pages a bit intimidating.<p class="message sent">Really? But it's user-friendly and easy to use. You just need to get used to it.<p class=message>That's good to hear. By the way, do you have any idea on how we can integrate that cool feature?<p class="message sent">Oh, you mean the one that makes the website sparkle and glow?<p class=message>Yeah, that one! But, I was thinking more of the one that lets you customize the background.<p class="message sent">That's possible, but we need to find the corresponding APIs to make it work.<p class=message>APIs? You mean those things that rely on HTTP requests to access web services?<p class="message sent">You got it! But there's more to it than just that.<p class=message>Wow, I had no idea. Do you often use them in your backend work?<p class="message sent">Yes, they're very useful in handling data processing and retrieving.<p class=message>I see. I'm amazed by what backend developers can do.<p class="message sent">And I'm equally amazed by what front-end developers are capable of doing. It's a great teamwork.<p class=message>Yeah, that's for sure. We always complement each other's skills.<p class="message sent">Speaking of skills, have you seen the latest update on CSS?<p class=message>Oh, do you mean the new CSS grid layout?<p class="message sent">Exactly! It's a game-changer in web page layout design.<p class=message>I've heard that it's flexible and responsive, making it easier to adjust and create dynamic web pages.<p class="message sent">Definitely. With these new features, we can create even more stunning web designs for our clients.<p class=message>Agreed! I can't wait to try it out.<p class="message sent">Same here. The world of web development is constantly evolving and it's exciting to be a part of it.<p class=message>It's definitely an ever-changing world, but that's what makes it fun and challenging at the same time.<p class="message sent">For sure. Let's strive to be the best in our field and create something great for our company.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ffecd429-37fe-4de3-b2a7-9b245b8a5ba4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
