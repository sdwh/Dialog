How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">It's going great, A! It's been busy, but it's always fun working here at the Mexican restaurant.<p class=message>Absolutely. Speaking of which, have you tried our new signature dish yet?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. What is it?<p class=message>It's called the "Baja Fish Tacos." It's a grilled mahi-mahi with cabbage slaw and jalapeno mayo on a warm tortilla.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! I'll have to try it on my break.<p class=message>Definitely do. And speaking of breaks, how's your shift looking?<p class="message sent">It's looking good. We have a few tables come in for lunch, but nothing I can't handle.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Remember to upsell some of our famous margaritas to go with their meals.<p class="message sent">Will do, A! By the way, did you hear about the new salsa flavor we're adding to our menu next month?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What is it?<p class="message sent">It's a mango-pineapple salsa! I tried it during our last tasting and it's really good.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. Our customers are going to love it.<p class="message sent">For sure! And speaking of customers, we have some regulars coming in today. I already have their usual order memorized.<p class=message>Excellent work, B. Keep it up and you'll be up for a promotion in no time.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I really appreciate your support as always.<p class=message>Of course, B. Now, let's get back to work and keep serving up those delicious Mexican dishes!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a89b0e6f-0a9e-4f95-be72-234b7a2b8c4f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
