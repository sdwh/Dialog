It's becoming more and more important for companies to have it these days.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I heard that it's a pretty intense process.<p class=message>Yeah, it definitely requires a lot of preparation and planning.<p class="message sent">Do you know what the evaluation criteria are?<p class=message>Well, there are 114 controls in total that need to be implemented and assessed.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a lot. I don't think I could handle that.<p class=message>It's definitely not for the faint of heart, but it's worth it in the end.<p class="message sent">Can any company get certified or are there certain criteria they have to meet?<p class=message>Well, any company can apply for certification, but they do have to meet certain requirements in terms of their information security practices.<p class="message sent">Got it. It sounds like a lot of work, but it's probably worth it for the peace of mind.<p class=message>Definitely. And not to mention, it looks good to clients and investors.<p class="message sent">Well, you've convinced me. I think I'll start looking into it for my company.<p class=message>That's great!
