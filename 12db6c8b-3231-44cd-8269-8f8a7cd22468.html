Thank you for coming in for your financial report meeting today.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Thank you for having me.<p class=message>So, let's take a look at your financial statements. How are sales looking this quarter?<p class="message sent">Well, the sales are not as high as we hoped for, but we’re working on new marketing strategies.<p class=message>That’s great to hear. How about your expenses?<p class="message sent">We’ve made some cost-cutting measures that helped us save a bit of money.<p class=message>Excellent. What about the projections for next quarter?<p class="message sent">We are expecting an increase in sales as well as better profit margins. Fingers crossed!<p class=message>That’s really great news, B. And speaking of fingers crossed, have you tried the new sushi restaurant that opened up near your office?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually! It was fantastic – I’m craving it again already. Have you tried it too?<p class=message>I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but it's been all the buzz around the office. Maybe we should plan a team lunch there sometime.<p class="message sent">That’s a great idea! I’m sure everyone would love that.<p class=message>Alright, let’s get back to business. Overall, your financial statements look good. Do you have any questions or concerns before we finalize them?<p class="message sent">No, I think everything is clear. Thank you for your help and the sushi restaurant recommendation!<p class=message>Anytime, B. And don't forget to save your receipts for that team lunch – we can expense it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=12d72899-97a4-4ade-bbb6-e69c0d65df17.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
