You're on point. But don't let its name scare you, it's not a horror movie.<p class="message sent">Haha, true. But it can be scary if you're not compliant, and a hacker gets into a company's systems.<p class=message>I agree. And when that happens, the company will have to say "bye bye" to their reputation.<p class="message sent">Exactly. But you know what, it's not all bad news. ISO 27001 could be the best ally against threats.<p class=message>How's that?<p class="message sent">By implementing its requirements, companies can identify and mitigate risks, averting potential attacks. Plus, they can show clients that they take security seriously.<p class=message>Oh, that's a good point. You're right, ISO 27001 can be a game-changer.<p class="message sent">Yup, it could be the security blanket that helps businesses sleep peacefully at night.<p class=message>Haha, that's a nice way to put it. I hope every company realizes its importance.<p class="message sent">Fingers crossed. By the way, have you heard about the new ISO 27002 update?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's new in it?<p class="message sent">Well, it includes guidelines for cloud security and mobile devices. It's like a cool security update for our tech-savvy world.<p class=message>Amazing, ISO is always on the lookout for new security challenges. I can't wait to read it.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's like an exciting book, but with less dragons and more firewalls.<p class=message>Haha, love the comparison. With ISO 27001 and a bit of humor, we're prepared for any threat that comes our way!<p class="message sent">You got that right!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=50b33aaf-30c1-4531-a392-50b8ce03bd92.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
