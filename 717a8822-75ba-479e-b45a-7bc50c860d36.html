Can you help me with that?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! What kind of car are you looking for?<p class=message>I'm not really sure, something practical but not too boring. I'm traveling with my family of four.<p class="message sent">Well, we have some great options for you. How about a Subaru Outback? It's spacious and comfortable, with plenty of room for luggage.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds perfect! And do you have any suggestions for an itinerary while we're here?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Melbourne is a great city with lots to see and do. You could start by visiting the Queen Victoria Market for some delicious food and shopping. Then, you can head over to St. Kilda Beach for a relaxing afternoon by the sea.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! What else do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Well, if you're interested in art, you can check out the National Gallery of Victoria. And if you're a sports fan, you can't miss the Melbourne Cricket Ground.<p class=message>Wow, it sounds like there's so much to do here! Thanks for all the suggestions.<p class="message sent">No problem at all! And if you have any questions or need any more recommendations, just let me know.<p class=message>Actually, do you have any recommendations for family-friendly restaurants?<p class="message sent">Yes, for sure. You should definitely try out the Pancake Parlour - they have delicious pancakes and great options for both kids and adults.<p class=message>Great, we'll definitely check that out. Thanks again for all your help!<p class="message sent">No problem at all, enjoy your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7174724c-25fe-4c5b-9875-582c8d7f3f0b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
