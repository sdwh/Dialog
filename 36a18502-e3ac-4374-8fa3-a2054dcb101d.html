How about you, A?<p class=message>I'm doing well, but there's something I wanted to discuss with you.<p class="message sent">Sure, what's on your mind?<p class=message>Well, I've been noticing some littering around the store lately.<p class="message sent">Really? That's not good. Have you reported it to the manager?<p class=message>Yes, I have, but I was wondering if there's anything more we can do about it.<p class="message sent">I see what you're saying. Personally, I think it starts with education.<p class=message>Education?<p class="message sent">Yes, if we can make customers aware of the importance of keeping the store clean, they'll be more likely to dispose of their trash properly.<p class=message>I completely agree. And what about encouraging them to bring their own bags instead of using plastic ones?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We should put up some signs and maybe even offer some incentives.<p class=message>Like a discount for customers who use reusable bags?<p class="message sent">Exactly. We can also make sure our trash bins are easily accessible and not overflowing.<p class=message>It sounds like we have a plan. I'm glad we could make a difference together.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's always good to take a proactive approach to these kinds of problems.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's do our best to keep the store clean and inviting for everyone.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=36a04d6e-a5c6-4381-840a-42f944a9a7b8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
