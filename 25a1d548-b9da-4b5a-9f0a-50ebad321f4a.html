Can you tell me how to use it?<p class="message sent">Of course! It's a great way to stay active during your stay here. Have you played before?<p class=message>I have a few times, but I'm not exactly an expert.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. We have racquets and balls available for rent at the front desk, would you like to rent them?<p class=message>That sounds perfect. How much does it cost?<p class="message sent">It's $5 per person per hour. You can book the court in advance at the front desk or simply walk in if it's not being used.<p class=message>That's very reasonable. Is there anything else I should know before I start playing?<p class="message sent">Well, the court is available from 9 AM to 9 PM daily. We ask that you wear non-marking shoes, and it's important to keep the noise level down so as not to disturb other guests.<p class=message>No problem, I'll keep that in mind. How long can I rent the court for?<p class="message sent">You can rent it for multiple hours if you'd like, just speak to the front desk and they will arrange it for you.<p class=message>Great, I'm looking forward to playing. Is there a maximum number of players allowed on the court?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a one-on-one game so only two players can use the court at the same time.<p class=message>I see. Thanks for your help, I'll head to the front desk to rent everything now.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Have a great time playing. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2599d8c9-23aa-41ff-bb21-ca6eea06defe.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
