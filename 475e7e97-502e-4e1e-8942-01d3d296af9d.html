How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks. Hey, I heard you're in charge of the database for this company. That must be a lot of work!<p class="message sent">It definitely keeps me busy, but I enjoy it. What brings you over to my department today?<p class=message>I'm here to perform a compliance audit for ISO 27001. I'm sure you're familiar with it?<p class="message sent">Yes, of course. We've been working hard to ensure our database meets all the necessary requirements.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, let's get started. Are there any areas in particular you'd like me to focus on?<p class="message sent">Well, we've recently implemented a new security feature that I'm very proud of. It'd be great if you could take a look at that and give us some feedback.<p class=message>Perfect. Let's start there. Oh, by the way, have you seen the new coffee machine in the break room? It's amazing!<p class="message sent">Oh, no, I haven't had a chance to check it out yet. I'm a bit of a tea drinker myself.<p class=message>Ah, gotcha. Well, they have a ton of different tea options too. Maybe we can take a quick break later and grab a drink.<p class="message sent">That sounds great to me. In the meantime, let me show you what we've been working on.<p class=message>Sounds good. Let's dive in.<p class=message>Alright, I think we're good to wrap up here. Thanks so much for your time, B.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, A. Thanks for making the audit process fun and light-hearted.<p class=message>Anytime. Have a great day, and enjoy that tea!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=475dd655-b670-4e1e-b36c-351baef08a09.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
