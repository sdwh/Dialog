Today we have a very special guest - B, a software engineer who will be introducing us to the latest backend development technologies. Welcome B!<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, A. It's great to be here.<p class=message>So B, can you tell us a little about the latest backend development technologies?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. One of the exciting technologies that has become popular recently is serverless architecture.<p class=message>Serverless? That sounds interesting. Can you explain what that means?<p class="message sent">Sure. Serverless means that developers don't have to worry about managing servers. Instead, they can focus on writing code and simply deploy it to the cloud.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a game-changer. What are some of the benefits of this approach?<p class="message sent">Well, for one, it saves developers a lot of time and effort. They don't have to worry about scaling or maintenance, as the cloud provider takes care of all of that.<p class=message>That sounds incredible. But what about security concerns? Don't you need to have more control over your servers to ensure safety?<p class="message sent">Actually, serverless computing can actually be more secure since most of the security concerns are handled automatically by the provider. Plus, you can focus on writing secure code rather than worrying about security.<p class=message>That's actually a really great point. Thank you so much for sharing all of this with us, B. Do you have anything else you'd like to add?<p class="message sent">I'd just like to say that the world of back-end development is constantly evolving, and it's important to always stay up to date with the latest technologies to stay relevant in the industry.<p class=message>Thank you, B. It was a pleasure to have you on our show today. And thank you, audience, for tuning in. Join us again next week for another exciting episode.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=86067069-c377-468f-bd6d-61c4d7f6591f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
