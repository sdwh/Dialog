Welcome to the Statue of Liberty. Is this your first time here in New York?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. I'm so excited to finally see Lady Liberty up close!<p class=message>That's great to hear! I'm your tour guide for today. My name is John.<p class="message sent">Hi, John. Nice to meet you! Is it always this crowded here?<p class=message>Yes, it's always busy here especially during peak tourist season. But we'll try to get some good photos of you with the statue.<p class="message sent">That sounds awesome. Can you recommend the best angle to get a perfect shot?<p class=message>Sure thing! We can start by standing right in front of the statue and angling your camera upwards to capture her face and torch.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see what you mean. How about the background? Should I include the city skyline as well?<p class=message>Definitely. That would make for a great shot. You can also try to position the statue to one side to get the Manhattan skyline in the frame.<p class="message sent">Thank you! I really appreciate your tips. By the way, do you know any interesting facts about the statue?<p class=message>Well, did you know that the statue was gifted to the United States by France as a symbol of friendship?<p class="message sent">That's interesting! How long did it take to complete the statue?<p class=message>It took about 9 years to complete and was finally unveiled in 1886.<p class="message sent">Wow, I didn't know that. Thanks for sharing! I can't wait to share these facts with my friends back home.<p class=message>You're welcome! Now let's get those pictures taken, shall we?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's do it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=05ce181f-f471-4610-a06e-32e173596b7d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
