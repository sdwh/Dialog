What kind of meat are we grilling?<p class=message>We've got some prime beef, juicy chicken, and savory pork all ready to go.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious. I'll make sure to recommend the perfect red or white wine to pair with each meat.<p class=message>You're the expert when it comes to wine. What do you suggest for the beef?<p class="message sent">A bold Cabernet Sauvignon will complement the meat's rich flavors perfectly. And for the chicken, I recommend a crisp and refreshing Sauvignon Blanc.<p class=message>That sounds like a perfect pairing. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.<p class="message sent">Same here! Can't wait to see the customers' reactions when they take their first bite.<p class=message>Speaking of customers, have you had any inquiries about the event?<p class="message sent">Yes, we've had quite a few people reserve their tables already.
