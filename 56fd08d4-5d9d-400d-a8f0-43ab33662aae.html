What kind of math is it?<p class="message sent">Just some basic algebra. I think I've got it down.<p class=message>Ah, algebra. That was my favorite subject in high school.<p class="message sent">Really? Why? It's kind of boring, isn't it?<p class=message>Well, I always found it satisfying to solve the problems and get the right answer.<p class="message sent">I guess I see what you mean. It feels good when you finally figure it out.<p class=message>Exactly. Plus, it's a skill that comes in handy in real life too.<p class="message sent">I guess you're right. I just want to finish this as quickly as possible so I can play some video games.<p class=message>Hey, don't forget about getting some exercise too. You don't want to be cooped up inside all day.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know. I'll take a break later and go for a run or something.<p class=message>That's the spirit! You don't want to end up like me, all out of shape and wheezing after climbing a flight of stairs.<p class="message sent">Haha, don't worry Dad, I won't let that happen.<p class=message>Good to hear, son. Keep up the good work on your math and make sure to get some fresh air too.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks, Dad.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=56fa31f6-8e1b-47e6-8da5-d91b489750a5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
