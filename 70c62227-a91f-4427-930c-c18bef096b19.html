I see you're also taking a break. How's your day going?<p class="message sent">Pretty busy actually, but it's not too bad. I just need a break to catch my breath.<p class=message>I know what you mean! Sometimes, being a cleaner can be tiring too.<p class="message sent">Speaking of cleaning, have you noticed any recurring problems that need to be addressed in this supermarket, sanitation-wise?<p class=message>Oh, yes. One issue is the amount of garbage that people leave behind. Especially near the snack aisles, it can get pretty messy.<p class="message sent">That's true. Do you know if we have enough trash bins placed in the aisles, perhaps?<p class=message>Hmm, I'm not exactly sure. But I think they could use a few more bins. Also, we should consider placing signs that remind customers to throw their trash in the bins provided.<p class="message sent">Great idea! Another thing I noticed is that the floors can get pretty slippery when they are wet. Maybe we can place more caution signs and wet floor mats to avoid accidents.<p class=message>That's a good point! Slippery floors can cause accidents, and that's the last thing we want. I think I going to suggest that to management.<p class="message sent">Awesome! It's great having you as a partner in ensuring a clean and safe environment. By the way, have you tried the new sandwich from the deli?<p class=message>Not yet, how is it?<p class="message sent">It's delicious! I definitely recommend it for your lunch break.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation. I'll have to try it out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=70c246e5-dc62-4d40-a06b-15e4ec72ccc1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
