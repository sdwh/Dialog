I'm a travel consultant, and I have a client who's interested in renting a car for a week to explore Melbourne.<p class="message sent">Great! We have a wide range of vehicles for hire. What type of car is your client looking for?<p class=message>My client prefers a compact car that's easy to handle and fuel-efficient. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Our Toyota Corolla is perfect for city driving and has great gas mileage.<p class=message>That sounds good. Could you give me an idea of the rental price for a week?<p class="message sent">The rental fee for a Toyota Corolla is $350 for a week, with 1000 km included.<p class=message>That seems reasonable. My client wants to visit the Great Ocean Road. Do you have any advice on the best route to take?<p class="message sent">Of course! The Great Ocean Road is a must-see attraction in Victoria. I suggest starting in Torquay and following the coast all the way to Port Fairy. You'll see breathtaking views of the ocean and limestone cliffs.<p class=message>That route sounds amazing. What about food stops along the way? Any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely try the seafood at Apollo Bay, and don't miss the Twelve Apostles Gourmet Food Trail. You can sample local cheeses, chocolates and wines!<p class=message>My client will love that. What else would you recommend to see and do in Melbourne?<p class="message sent">Melbourne has so much to offer! I suggest visiting the Royal Botanic Gardens, taking a tram ride around the city, and exploring the laneways for street art and trendy cafes.<p class=message>Those are great suggestions! Thank you so much for your help. I'll let my client know about the Toyota Corolla and the recommended route and stops.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions. Enjoy your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9ce89693-4be9-4063-84d1-500f7aa2695a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
