Where would you like to go today?<p class="message sent">Good morning. I need to get to the Willis Tower, please.<p class=message>Alright, we'll be there in no time. Do you mind if we discuss some traffic rules while we're on the road?<p class="message sent">Not at all. I'm all ears.<p class=message>Great! Did you know that in Chicago, it's illegal to pass a stopped school bus that has its stop arm extended?<p class="message sent">Wow, I had no idea.<p class=message>It's also important to always stop for pedestrians in crosswalks, especially in busy areas like downtown.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. How about speeding?<p class=message>Well, you definitely want to avoid that. The speed limit on most streets here is 30 miles per hour.<p class="message sent">Got it. And what about turning?<p class=message>You need to make sure you use your turn signals at least 100 feet before turning, and always yield to pedestrians and oncoming traffic before making a left turn.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tips. This is really helpful!<p class=message>No problem at all. We'll try to follow all of these rules and get you to your destination safely.<p class="message sent">I appreciate that. By the way, do you have any recommendations for good restaurants in the area?<p class=message>Definitely! Let me tell you about my favorite pizza placeâ€¦</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5dd868b9-775a-4e3e-956c-11d67bda477b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
