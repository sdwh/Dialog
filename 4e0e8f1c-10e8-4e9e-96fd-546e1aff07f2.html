Can you help me with that?<p class=message>Sure, we have several meeting rooms available in different sizes. What are your requirements?<p class="message sent">I need a room that can fit around 20 people, with audio and visual equipment.<p class=message>Not a problem. We have a few options that meet your needs. How long do you need the room for?<p class="message sent">Just for a day, from 9am to 5pm.<p class=message>Okay, perfect. May I know what kind of presentation you'll be doing? Maybe I can suggest some additional equipment to enhance your meeting.<p class="message sent">It's just a standard PowerPoint presentation. But if you have any suggestions, I'm all ears!<p class=message>How about a projector and a screen, and maybe some extra flip charts and markers? It's always good to have some backups.<p class="message sent">Great idea, let's go with that.<p class=message>Alright, let me check the availability for you. (pause) We have the 'Sunrise' meeting room available on that day, would you like to book it?<p class="message sent">Yeah, that sounds good. How much does it cost?<p class=message>It's $500 for the whole day, with the equipment included. Is that within your budget?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. Let's book it.<p class=message>Perfect. Can I get your name and contact information?<p class="message sent">Sure, my name is John Smith and my phone number is 123-456-7890.<p class=message>Thank you, John. We'll send you a confirmation email shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class="message sent">No, that's all. Thank you so much for your help!<p class=message>You're welcome, John. Have a great day and good luck with your presentation!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e0c6698-3dfe-4d9e-ae7b-c1ef95615635.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
