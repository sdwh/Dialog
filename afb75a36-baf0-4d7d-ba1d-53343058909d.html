I heard you're the guide for our chocolate-making class today?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. Welcome to Barcelona's chocolate factory!<p class=message>Thanks! I'm excited to learn about making authentic Spanish chocolate.<p class="message sent">You're in the right place. Before that, let me give you a quick background of our chocolate history.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. I'm all ears.<p class="message sent">Did you know that Spain has been enjoying chocolate since the 16th century?<p class=message>Really? That's quite impressive. How did it all start?<p class="message sent">It all began when the conquistadors brought cocoa beans back from the New World. The Spaniards then added sugar and vanilla to create a sweet drink, which quickly became a national obsession.<p class=message>Fascinating! Now I'm even more eager to start the class.<p class="message sent">Great! Here we are at the production floor. Let's wash our hands and put on our aprons.<p class=message>Sure thing. I feel like a real chocolate artisan now.<p class="message sent">You sure look like one. Let's begin by roasting the cocoa beans.<p class=message>Mmm, the smell is heavenly. What's next?<p class="message sent">We have to grind the beans to release the cocoa butter and create a liquid form called chocolate liquor. Then, we temper and mold the chocolate.<p class=message>I see. That's quite an intense process. But I'm sure the taste is worth it.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And the best part is getting to taste the finished product.<p class=message>I can't wait! This has been a delicious experience.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you enjoyed it. Remember, you can always come back to our factory whenever you're in Barcelona.<p class=message>Thank you, B, I'll be sure to do that. I'll take a box of chocolate as a souvenir, too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=afb05aa9-4bf1-4310-af49-275a3b03e3f3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
