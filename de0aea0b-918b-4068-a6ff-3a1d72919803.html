How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It was great. I spent most of my time binge-watching my favorite TV show.<p class=message>Sounds like fun. What show were you watching?<p class="message sent">I was watching Friends. It's an old show, but it still makes me laugh.<p class=message>Oh, I love Friends too. Who's your favorite character?<p class="message sent">I have to say Chandler. His sense of humor is just too good.<p class=message>Yes, Chandler is hilarious. So, do you have any questions about last week's lesson?<p class="message sent">Yes, I was a little confused about the grammar rules you explained. Could you go over it again?<p class=message>Of course, I'd be happy to. Let me grab the whiteboard marker.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. You're such a helpful teacher.<p class=message>No problem, B. Speaking of grammar, have you heard the joke about the past, present, and future walking into a bar?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's the punchline?<p class=message>It was tense. (laughs)<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's a good one, A. You always make class fun.<p class=message>Thanks, B. As they say, a little bit of humor goes a long way. Speaking of which, our class is almost over. Don't forget about the quiz on Friday.<p class="message sent">Thanks for reminding me, A. I'll make sure to study.<p class=message>Great. Keep up the good work, B. See you next class.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A.
