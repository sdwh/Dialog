Are you ready for our quest to find the missing wizard?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A! With my strength and your archery skills, we'll be unstoppable.<p class=message>Haha, thank you for the compliment. But we both know we'll need more than just brawn and arrows. Any ideas on where to start?<p class="message sent">Well, the last time anyone saw the wizard was in the forest near the old castle. Maybe we can start our search there.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. But be on the lookout, I heard rumors of trolls and goblins lurking around that area.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, A. I have my sword and shield ready to take them on. And your arrows should do the trick too.<p class=message>Good point. Speaking of weapons, have you seen the wizard's magical staff anywhere?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I'm sure we'll come across it during our journey. That staff is like a beacon of power, it's hard to miss.<p class=message>Agreed. And with that staff in our hands, we'll have a better chance of finding the wizard and defeating any foes that come our way.<p class="message sent">Let's not get ahead of ourselves, A. We still have a long way to go. But I have faith in us, we make a pretty great team.<p class=message>Haha, I couldn't agree more. We'll stick together and face whatever challenges come our way.<p class="message sent">And when we do find the wizard, we'll throw him a celebratory feast for all his hard work and magical talents.<p class=message>I like the way you think, B. But let's focus on finding him first. The fate of the kingdom rests in our hands!<p class="message sent">Onward, to adventure and glory!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2fb5410d-b3a5-4c0d-83e7-6d3aa09bef6a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
