It's all about keeping data and information secure, right?<p class=message>That's right! It's a set of standards that businesses can implement to ensure their data and information are secure and protected.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds pretty important. Do you know who needs to comply with it?<p class=message>Any business that handles sensitive data or information, especially those in the tech and banking industries.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. So, what does it take to become compliant with ISO 27001?<p class=message>Well, it requires a lot of work and dedication to ensure that all employees are aware of the security policies and procedures. It's all about creating a culture of security awareness.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. Do you think you could become certified in it?<p class=message>Of course! It's definitely possible for anyone who puts in the effort and has a good understanding of the standards.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I think it's important for everyone to be aware of cyber security these days.<p class=message>Absolutely! It's becoming more and more important as technology continues to advance.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, have you heard about the recent data breaches in the news?<p class=message>Yes, it's pretty scary stuff. That's why ISO 27001 Security Awareness is so important.<p class="message sent">Totally agree. Do you think we should recommend it to our company?<p class=message>Definitely! It could only benefit us and our customers to have a stronger security culture.<p class="message sent">Alright then, let's bring it up in our next meeting.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Thanks for the chat, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, A!
