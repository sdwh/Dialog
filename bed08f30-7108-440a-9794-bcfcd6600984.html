Do you have any tips for someone who's just starting out with SQL Server?<p class=message>One thing I always recommend is to practice coding every day. Consistent practice will help you get comfortable with the syntax and commands so that you'll be able to write code more efficiently.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. How long do you think it will take to become proficient in SQL Server?<p class=message>It really depends on how much time you dedicate to learning and practicing. Some people learn it quickly while for others it might take a bit longer. But with consistent effort, you should be able to feel comfortable with SQL Server within a few months.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice! Are there any common mistakes that beginners make when learning SQL Server?<p class=message>One mistake that people often make is not understanding the importance of data normalization. It's important to understand how to structure data in a way that avoids redundancy and inconsistency.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Are there any exciting developments in SQL Server that you're excited about?<p class=message>Yes, actually! SQL Server 2019 has some exciting new features, including support for big data clusters and the ability to run SQL Server on Kubernetes.
