What did you think of it?<p class=message>I just tried it for the first time and I must say, it was quite delicious.<p class="message sent">I agree, the sauce was lovely and tangy. Not too spicy, but with just enough kick.<p class=message>I also appreciate the presentation. The way it was served in a champagne flute really made it feel like a fancy treat.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And the shrimp themselves were cooked just right. Not too tough or too soft.<p class=message>I've had shrimp cocktail before, but this one definitely stood out to me.<p class="message sent">Same here. It's the perfect appetizer. Light and refreshing, but still satisfying.<p class=message>I wonder if they make the sauce in-house.<p class="message sent">I was curious about that too. I'll have to ask our waiter.<p class=message>I could definitely see myself ordering this again.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's a classic for a reason.<p class=message>And the portion size is just right. Enough to share, but not too much that it fills you up.<p class="message sent">Good point. It's the perfect start to a meal.<p class=message>I'm glad we both enjoyed it.<p class="message sent">Same here. Now, let's see what else is on the menu.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ec068491-6075-4028-bb30-614b09111d98.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
