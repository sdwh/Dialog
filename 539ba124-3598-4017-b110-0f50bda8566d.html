How's the business going?<p class="message sent">Hey, buddy! Pretty good! But I am always looking for ways to improve. Speaking of which, have you caught any big fish lately?<p class=message>I've been lucky this week. I got a lot of salmon and some tuna. Would you be interested in some?<p class="message sent">Definitely! Fresh salmon and tuna are crowd-pleasers! And what about the crabs and lobsters? I need them for my signature dishes.<p class=message>I know a spot where the crabs and lobsters are always abundant. You can count on me to go there tomorrow.<p class="message sent">You're the best, buddy. By the way, I've been thinking about adding some exotic fare to the menu. What do you think?<p class=message>Hmm, like what?<p class="message sent">Maybe some grilled octopus or spicy squid? Or even sea urchin! People love trying new things.<p class=message>Sounds adventurous! I like it. I think they'll be a hit with the customers.<p class="message sent">Great! And speaking of the customers, do you have any suggestions on how we can improve our dishes and service?<p class=message>Well, I noticed some customers like their seafood really spicy, so maybe we should offer some spicier options. And it might be nice to offer some gluten-free and vegetarian dishes too.<p class="message sent">Good point! We'll definitely take that into consideration. Thanks for the feedback!<p class=message>No problem! It's all about making our customers happy.<p class="message sent">You got that right, buddy. And with your help, we'll keep delivering the freshest and tastiest seafood in town.<p class=message>That's what it's all about. Til next time, boss!<p class="message sent">Take care, buddy! See you soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5399f3f9-fa13-4718-9f1e-4f6138deee0d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
