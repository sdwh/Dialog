I heard you want to learn ASP.NET Core. Do you have any programming experience?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. Yes, I have some experience in Java programming language.<p class=message>That's great. ASP.NET Core is a web framework similar to Java Spring. I suggest getting started with some basic tutorials on the Microsoft website.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll check it out. How long do you think it will take me to get the hang of it?<p class=message>Well, it depends on how much time you devote to learning it. But if you're consistent, you should be able to get a basic understanding within a month or two.<p class="message sent">That sounds reasonable. Is there anything else I need to know?<p class=message>Yes, one thing that makes ASP.NET Core stand out is its dependency injection feature, which makes application development easier and more maintainable. You'll learn more about that as you go along.<p class="message sent">Cool, I'll keep that in mind. By the way, do you have any tips for learning a new programming language?<p class=message>Sure. I suggest starting with small projects and gradually increasing their complexity. Also, don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's how you learn. And finally, make sure you enjoy the process!<p class="message sent">Thank you for the tips, A. This has been really helpful.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=43b8e0b3-bd45-4327-9d5f-00ca1ea59870.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
