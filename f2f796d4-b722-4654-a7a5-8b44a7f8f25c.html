You must be B the photographer. Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hello Chef A, yes I'm B. I'm excited to be learning how to make traditional wagashi with you in Kyoto.<p class=message>I'm glad you're here. So, have you worked with food photography before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. But shooting desserts has always been my favorite subject. How about you? Have you ever been in front of the camera?<p class=message>(laughs) No, not really. I'm more comfortable behind the scenes. I'm excited to teach you though. Today, we'll be making daifuku and dorayaki.<p class="message sent">Those sound delicious! What ingredients do we need?<p class=message>For daifuku, we'll need sweet rice flour, red bean paste and potato starch. And for dorayaki, flour, eggs, sugar, honey and red bean paste.<p class="message sent">It seems simple enough. Can we get started?<p class=message>Let's do it! We'll start with the daifuku. First, we'll make the dough with the sweet rice flour and water.<p class="message sent">This looks fun! Can I take some photos of the process?<p class=message>Of course! Let's get creative with the shots.<p class="message sent">Alright! I'll try to capture the textures and colors of the ingredients.<p class=message>Great idea. I'll make sure to demonstrate how to wrap the dough around the red bean paste filling.<p class="message sent">Mmm, that looks amazing. I can't wait to try them.<p class=message>Now let's move on to the dorayaki. We'll mix together the flour, eggs, sugar and honey.<p class="message sent">I'm loving the smells in here. The sweetness of the honey is so inviting.<p class=message>Yes, the honey adds a unique flavor. And once we sandwich the red bean paste between two pancakes, it's going to be delicious.<p class="message sent">I think this has been my favorite photography session so far. I love the colors and shapes of the wagashi.<p class=message>It's great to hear that. It's important to appreciate the aesthetics of food in order to capture it properly.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And your expert guidance throughout this process has been greatly appreciated. Thank you, Chef A.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, B. Remember to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Now let's take some photographs of the finished products!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f2f732f1-c382-4279-a170-9578d5b81532.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
