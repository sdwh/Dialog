How can I help you?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm interested in some aerobic training. Can you give me some advice?<p class=message>Of course, what's your goal? Weight loss, endurance or something else?<p class="message sent">I want to lose weight and improve my fitness level.<p class=message>That's great. We have a lot of classes and machines for cardio training. Which one do you prefer?<p class="message sent">I'm not sure. Can you recommend some classes?<p class=message>Sure. How about the dance-inspired classes like Zumba or BodyJam? They're fun and effective.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. Can I try it first?<p class=message>Of course, we have a free trial class today. Would you like to join?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. What time does it start?<p class=message>It starts at 11am in the group fitness room. I'll reserve a spot for you.<p class="message sent">Thanks a lot. What should I wear?<p class=message>Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. And bring a towel and water bottle.<p class="message sent">Ok, got it. Do I need to eat something before the class?<p class=message>It's better to have a light meal or snack 1-2 hours before the class. But don't eat too much.<p class="message sent">I see. Is there anything else I should know?<p class=message>Yes, listen to your body and don't push yourself too hard at the beginning. And if you have any health issues, please consult your doctor before doing any exercise.<p class="message sent">Thank you for the advice. I'm excited to try the class.<p class=message>You're welcome. Enjoy your workout and feel free to ask me any questions. I'll be around.<p class="message sent">Sure, thanks again.
