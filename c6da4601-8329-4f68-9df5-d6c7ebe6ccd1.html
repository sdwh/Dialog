My name is A and I work in food processing. What about you?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm B, the owner of this candy store. Nice to meet you! So you're involved in food processing, what's that like?<p class=message>It's actually really interesting. We recently started producing traditional candies here in Chaozhou. Have you ever tried them?<p class="message sent">Of course! I sell them in my store. They're some of our best sellers.<p class=message>That's great to hear! I've always wondered what the process is like on your end. How do you source your ingredients?<p class="message sent">We source our ingredients locally, especially for our signature flavors. We want to support other local businesses in the area.<p class=message>That's really nice to hear. Quality ingredients definitely make a difference in flavor. Do you have any favorites?<p class="message sent">I personally love the white rabbit candy. It's a classic and always reminds me of my childhood. What about you?<p class=message>I'm a fan of the peanut candy. The balance of sweet and salty is just perfect.<p class="message sent">I agree, the peanut candy is definitely a fan favorite too. We even had a customer come all the way from another province just to buy it!<p class=message>Wow, that's a testament to how good it is. Have you thought about expanding to other cities or even internationally?<p class="message sent">We have considered it, but we're taking it one step at a time for now. There's still so much we can do locally to improve and expand our offerings.<p class=message>That's understandable. It's always important to focus on improving what you have before expanding. I wish you all the best with your business, B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A! It was really nice talking to you. Don't forget to stop by my store sometime to try our new flavors.<p class=message>I definitely will! Thanks and have a great day, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c6d83e61-4955-41ee-9eb6-8055828dc49e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
