Basically, it provides a framework for keeping data secure.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. What sort of controls does it include?<p class=message>There are quite a few, but some examples are access controls, risk assessment, and incident management.<p class="message sent">Hmm, interesting. Are there any specific requirements for the controls?<p class=message>Yeah, there are certain things that need to be met in order to be compliant with the standard.<p class="message sent">Do you think it's worth implementing for a company?<p class=message>Definitely. It's becoming more and more important to protect sensitive data, and being ISO 27001 certified can give clients confidence in your company's security.<p class="message sent">I hadn't thought about that. Do you think it's difficult to implement?<p class=message>It can be a bit of work, but there are consultants who can help guide a company through the process.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. Have you worked on an ISO 27001 project before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It was a bit of a challenge, but we were able to get our client certified within a year.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. I might have to pick your brain some more about this later.<p class=message>Anytime! It's an important topic and definitely worth discussing.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a2956cd9-18e0-4fa8-9467-4e7479b0d857.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
