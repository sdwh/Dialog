I'm the manager of this hotel. Nice to meet you, B. Are you enjoying Tokyo so far?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! Yes, I am. Tokyo is amazing, especially the food! Speaking of which, where's a good place to try some local cuisine?<p class=message>Oh, I know just the place. It's a small restaurant nearby that serves traditional sushi. Have you tried it yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Sounds exciting! What do they offer?<p class=message>They have a great selection of fresh seafood, like tuna and crab. You also have to try their sake. It's a type of Japanese rice wine.<p class="message sent">I'd love to! But what if tourists don't eat seafood?<p class=message>Good point. You can also try tempura or teriyaki chicken. Japanese cuisine has a lot of options for non-seafood eaters.<p class="message sent">That's great to know. I'm going to tell my guests about that. But is there anything else they should know about Japanese dining culture?<p class=message>Absolutely! In Japan, it's customary to say "Itadakimasu" before beginning a meal to show gratitude. And remember to use chopsticks properly!<p class="message sent">Ah, interesting. So, it's not impolite to slurp noodles or soup loudly?<p class=message>Actually, it's considered a compliment to the chef if you slurp your noodles. It shows that you're enjoying the food!<p class="message sent">Haha, I guess I'll have to slurp loudly, then. Thanks for the tip! And how about tipping?<p class=message>There's no need to tip in Japan. The service charge is already included in the bill.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's very different from my country. I'm really learning a lot!<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that, B. Japan has a rich culinary culture, and it's always great to share it with others. Let's go and enjoy some sushi!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a41345b0-c712-4a88-b97e-951fcf2392f9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
