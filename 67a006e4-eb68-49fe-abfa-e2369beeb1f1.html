It’s a set of standards for keeping sensitive information safe, right?<p class=message>Yep, that’s exactly it. I’m thinking of implementing it in our company.<p class="message sent">That’s a good idea. It’s important to ensure confidentiality for our clients and our business.<p class=message>Exactly! But, to be honest, I’m a bit overwhelmed. There’s so much information to take in.<p class="message sent">I hear you. It can be a bit daunting. But, it’s definitely worth it in the end.<p class=message>I hope so. Have you implemented it before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we did last year. It was tough at first, but now it’s just a part of our routine.<p class=message>That’s reassuring to hear. What were some of the challenges you faced during implementation?<p class="message sent">The biggest challenge was getting everyone on board. We had to explain the importance of confidentiality and ensure that everyone was following the standards.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work.<p class="message sent">It was, but it’s worth it. We’re now able to assure our clients that their information is in safe hands.<p class=message>You’re convincing me more and more. Do you have any tips for getting started?<p class="message sent">Start by reviewing the standards and identifying areas where you need to improve. From there, create a plan and work with your team to implement it.<p class=message>Got it. I’ll definitely take that advice. Thanks, B!<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. It’s always good to improve our standards and ensure confidentiality for our clients.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=679fd6b7-3e88-4d71-b26b-12d2e70ba9eb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
