Just finished packing up orders to be delivered to customers in Zhuhai.<p class=message>Ah, I see. I'm the delivery guy, here to pick them up.<p class="message sent">Awesome! I've got everything ready for you. What types of food are you delivering today?<p class=message>It's quite a mix, actually. From seafood to dim sum, and even some durian-flavored snacks.<p class="message sent">Durian snacks? That's definitely an acquired taste.<p class=message>Yeah, it is. But some people just can't get enough of that pungent smell.<p class="message sent">More power to them, I guess. Do you have any delivery tips for me?<p class=message>Well, I'd suggest making sure the cold items stay cold, and keeping the hot items hot. And always double-check the address before you head out.<p class="message sent">Good advice. What's the craziest delivery experience you've had so far?<p class=message>Actually, I once delivered a whole roasted pig to a customer's house. That was definitely a first for me.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's insane. I hope they had a big enough oven to fit it in.<p class=message>Yeah, they did. And they were having a big party that night, so it worked out perfectly.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Well, good luck with the deliveries today. Stay safe out there!<p class=message>Thanks, I will. Have a good one!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=57e5da92-f98c-433b-a609-f7fff21a507e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
