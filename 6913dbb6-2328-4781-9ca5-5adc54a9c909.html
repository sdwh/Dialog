I'm happy to have you here with us today.<p class="message sent">Hi, thank you for having me. I've never been to a farm before, so I'm really excited about this.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, are you ready to do some fruit picking?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What kind of fruit are we picking today?<p class=message>We're picking some delicious peaches and apricots. They're in season now and we have a great crop this year.<p class="message sent">Yum, I can't wait to try them. Is there anything I need to know before we start?<p class=message>Well, it's pretty easy. You just need to look for the ripe fruit, gently twist it off the tree, and put it in your basket. Be careful not to damage the tree or the fruit. And if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.<p class="message sent">Got it. This is so much fun! I feel like a real farmer now.<p class=message>(laughs) You sure do. And you're doing a great job. I think you have a talent for this.<p class="message sent">Thank you! Maybe I'll start my own farm someday.<p class=message>(jokingly) Hey, you never know. Maybe you'll be our competition one day.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I don't think I could compete with your amazing produce. These peaches and apricots are the juiciest I've ever tasted.<p class=message>(smiling) It's all in the love and care we put into growing them. That's what makes them so special.<p class="message sent">I can definitely taste the love. Thank you for showing me around and teaching me how to pick fruit. This has been a wonderful experience.<p class=message>You're very welcome. It's always fun to share the joy of farming with others. And who knows, maybe you'll come back and visit us someday.<p class="message sent">I would love to. Maybe I'll even bring some friends and we can all go peaches and apricots picking together.<p class=message>(smiling) That sounds like a great plan. We'll be waiting for you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=69125bd2-aac5-491e-ae68-8ecf58ff3a88.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
