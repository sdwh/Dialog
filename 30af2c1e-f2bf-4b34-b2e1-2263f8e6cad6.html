Can I interest you in some local delicacies from San Francisco today?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too! Sure, what do you recommend?<p class=message>Our must-try dish is the seafood chowder. It's made with fresh seafood caught right here in San Francisco.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! How much is it?<p class=message>It's $10 for a bowl, but I promise it's worth it. We use only the freshest ingredients.<p class="message sent">Well, I'll give it a try then. Can I also get a side of garlic bread?<p class=message>Of course! That'll be an additional $5. Anything else for you?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about a soft drink? Do you have any Coke or Pepsi?<p class=message>Sorry, we only have organic sodas. They're a bit more expensive, but they're healthy!<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll try one. How much are they?<p class=message>They're $3 each. Which flavor would you like? We have lemon-lime, orange, and raspberry.<p class="message sent">I'll have the raspberry. Thanks for validating my parking coupon! How long have you been running this food truck?<p class=message>My family has been in the food business for generations, but I started this food truck about five years ago. It's been a great experience.<p class="message sent">That's so cool! Have you thought about opening up a restaurant someday?<p class=message>Actually, I have! That's my next big dream. Do you have any recommendations on a good location?<p class="message sent">Well, if you're looking for a trendy spot, Hayes Valley or the Dogpatch would be good. But if you want more foot traffic, the Financial District would be ideal.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendations! Let me get your order ready. Enjoy your lunch!<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! I'm excited to try the chowder. Good luck with your restaurant dreams!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=30ace780-af2d-4f04-80ce-9751314de622.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
