Looks like you're really focused on that book.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's really fascinating. I could barely put it down!<p class=message>Well, that's great to hear. What is it about that book that is capturing your attention?<p class="message sent">It's a mystery novel. I just have to find out who did it!<p class=message>Ah, I see. What's the title of the book?<p class="message sent">"The Mysterious Disappearance of Mr. Jones." Have you read it?<p class=message>Can't say that I have. I tend to stick to nonfiction myself. What type of books do you usually read?<p class="message sent">I like all sorts of genres, but mystery is definitely my favorite. What about you?<p class=message>I'm a big fan of history books. Have you ever read "The Guns of August" by Barbara Tuchman? It's a fascinating book about the first month of World War I.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I haven't read that one yet. Maybe I'll check it out after I finish this one.<p class=message>Great idea! Say, are you finished with that book? I saw someone else looking for it earlier.<p class="message sent">Oh, sure! Here you go. Enjoy!<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. By the way, have you ever considered writing your own mystery novel?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have! I've been working on one for a while now.<p class=message>That's fantastic. I bet it would be a great read. Let me know when it's published!<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks for the support!<p class=message>Of course! It's always great to see young people with a passion for literature. Good luck with your writing!<p class="message sent">Thank you, I appreciate it.
