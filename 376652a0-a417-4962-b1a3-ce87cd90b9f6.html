How's it going?<p class="message sent">Pretty good, A. Just working on some automated testing scripts. What about you?<p class=message>Same here. We both work in different fields of testing, but I was wondering what tools you use for your automated testing?<p class="message sent">Well, personally, I prefer Selenium. It's versatile and easy to use.<p class=message>Oh, cool! Yeah, I've heard a lot about it. I usually use Appium for mobile testing.<p class="message sent">Appium is great too. Do you ever use any load testing tools?<p class=message>Yeah, JMeter is my go-to for load testing. What about you?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of LoadRunner. It's an oldie but a goodie.<p class=message>Haha yeah, it's been around for quite some time. So, have you ever faced any challenges while automating tests?<p class="message sent">Definitely. One of the biggest challenges I've faced is maintaining the scripts. With different versions of software and updates, the tests can sometimes fail.<p class=message>Yeah, that can be annoying. But that's where version control comes in handy, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And having a good bug tracking tool is important too. What do you use for bug tracking?<p class=message>We use JIRA. It's one of the most popular ones out there.<p class="message sent">JIRA is great, but sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming. Have you ever tried Trello?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's good about Trello?<p class="message sent">Well, it's a simpler, more visual way to track bugs, as well as the status of the tests.<p class=message>Interesting, I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. And if you ever need any help with automated testing, just let me know.<p class=message>Thanks, B. Same goes for you if you need anything related to manual testing. It's always good to have a diverse team.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Alright, I better get back to my automated scripts. Talk to you later, A!<p class=message>See ya, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=37621422-6bec-4d1d-aaa2-68fcf28c64bc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
