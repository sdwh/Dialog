I've been experiencing some backache lately and it's been really bothering me. Do you have any idea what might be causing it?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Backaches can be caused by a lot of things such as poor posture, muscle strain, injury or even stress. Can you tell me more about your daily routine and activities?<p class=message>Well, I work in an office most of the day and I sit at my desk a lot. I don't do much exercise, to be honest.<p class="message sent">That could be the cause then. Sitting for long periods without moving can put a lot of pressure on your lower back muscles. How bad is the pain on a scale of 1 to 10?<p class=message>I would say it's about a 7 or 8 at times.<p class="message sent">Alright, we need to come up with a plan to manage the pain. I suggest some physical therapy sessions to help strengthen your core muscles and improve your posture. We can also try some pain relief medication for the time being.<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea. I'll definitely try to be more active and take breaks to walk around during my workday. Thanks for your help, doctor.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Don't forget to come back for a follow-up soon so we can monitor your progress.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=18501248-a68c-4563-b6ce-dbb24651b077.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
