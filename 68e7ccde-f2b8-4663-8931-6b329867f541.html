It's so addictive, I couldn't put it down.<p class=message>I know the feeling, I've been playing Mario Kart all week. It's probably my favorite game on the Switch so far.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love Mario Kart too! Have you tried playing online with friends? It's even more fun.<p class=message>Yes, I have! I always end up yelling at my screen when someone hits me with a blue shell right before the finish line.<p class="message sent">Haha, I know the feeling! Speaking of online play, have you tried playing Splatoon 2? It's so much fun and you can team up with your friends too.<p class=message>No, I haven't tried it yet, but I've heard good things about it. Maybe we can play together sometime?<p class="message sent">Definitely! Let me know when you're free and we can schedule a match.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. By the way, have you heard about the new Switch Lite that's coming out soon?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. It looks pretty cool, but I think I'll stick with my regular Switch for now.<p class=message>Same here. I like the option of being able to switch it up between TV and handheld mode.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Plus, there's just something satisfying about being able to dock it and play on a big screen.<p class=message>Definitely. Hey, have you ever played Super Smash Bros. on the Switch? It's another great multiplayer game.<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's so much fun, but I always end up getting my butt kicked by my friends.<p class=message>Haha, it can be pretty intense. But that's part of the appeal, right? Competitive but still fun.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And I love how the characters are all from different games, it makes it feel like a huge crossover event.<p class=message>Yes, and the addition of DLC characters adds even more variety. Did you hear that Banjo-Kazooie is coming to the game soon?<p class="message sent">No way, that's awesome! I used to play that game all the time when I was a kid.<p class=message>Me too! I can't wait to see how they'll play in Smash Bros. And on that note, I think I'm gonna go play some more Mario Kart. Chat with you later, B!<p class="message sent">Have fun, A! Catch you later.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=68e784e3-957b-4a5f-b73a-7252098f58f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
