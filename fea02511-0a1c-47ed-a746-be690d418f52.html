How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I'm looking for something sweet to go with my coffee. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Well, we have a variety of pastries and cakes. Our raspberry lemon cake is a popular choice, or perhaps our almond croissants.<p class="message sent">Hmm, those both sound delicious. Which is your personal favorite?<p class=message>Honestly, I can never resist our chocolate hazelnut cake. It's definitely a customer favorite too.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll take one of those and a latte please.<p class=message>Great choice! Coming right up. So, what brings you in today? Just looking for a treat or do you have a specific occasion?<p class="message sent">No occasion, just a typical Monday morning caffeine and sugar fix.<p class=message>I hear you on that one. You know, our cakes and pastries are all made fresh daily by our pastry chef.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that's impressive. Do you have any specials today?<p class=message>Actually, we have a new cherry and almond tart that just came out of the oven. It's not even on the menu yet.<p class="message sent">Ooh, that sounds intriguing. I might have to try one of those next time.<p class=message>Definitely give it a try. It's been a hit with our taste testers.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendation. This cake and latte are amazing, by the way. You guys really know how to make a mean coffee and pastry.<p class=message>Thank you so much, that means a lot. We take pride in our craft and love to hear feedback like that.<p class="message sent">I can tell â€“ the quality really shows. Keep up the great work, and I'll see you next time!<p class=message>Thanks again, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fe988773-c95b-46d2-a8fc-ba8ea94bb34a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
