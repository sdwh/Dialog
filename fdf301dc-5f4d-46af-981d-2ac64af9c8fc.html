Are you ready for the surgery today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Nurse A. Yes, I am ready to operate on this patient. How is the patient doing?<p class=message>The patient is doing fine, Doctor. The anesthesia is already in effect and the vital signs are stable.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. We will be performing a laparoscopic surgery today. Have you assisted in this type of procedure before?<p class=message>Yes, I've assisted in several cases before. I'm very familiar with the procedure.<p class="message sent">Excellent. That will make things easier. Have you had breakfast yet?<p class=message>Not yet, Doctor. Why do you ask?<p class="message sent">I thought we could share a funny surgical joke while we prepare for the operation. Do you have one?<p class=message>Sure, Doctor. What did one cell say to his sister cell when she stepped on his toe? "Mitosis!"<p class="message sent">Hahaha! That's a good one. I'll have to remember that for future surgeries.<p class=message>Glad you liked it, Doctor. Let's get ready for the surgery now. We don't want to make the patient wait too long.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's scrub in and get to work. Thanks for your assistance, Nurse A. You're a great help.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, Doctor. Let's make sure everything goes smoothly today. Best of luck to us!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fdf1f56b-d6a9-43d0-ae45-bc28d8000353.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
