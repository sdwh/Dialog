How's your shift going so far?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. It's been pretty busy, but we're managing well.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Have you recommended any dishes to our customers today?<p class="message sent">Yes, I suggested our signature steak dish to a couple, and they absolutely loved it.<p class=message>Fantastic. And how about our new dessert menu?<p class="message sent">It's been a hit, especially the chocolate lava cake. One customer even ordered a second portion!<p class=message>That's music to my ears. I'm glad our customers are enjoying their dining experience.<p class="message sent">Speaking of our customers, I had an interesting conversation with a group of tourists earlier. They were fascinated by the South African cuisine and wanted to know more about our local ingredients.<p class=message>That's wonderful. We should offer a food tour or cooking class for them in the future.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a great idea. I'm sure they'll appreciate it. By the way, I also talked to a regular customer of ours. He asked me about your special recipe for the marinade used in our grilled chicken.<p class=message>Ah, that's a trade secret. But I can tell you that it's a blend of different herbs and spices that I've perfected over the years.<p class="message sent">I'll let him know. Our customers always appreciate the personal touch and attention to detail we have here.<p class=message>Absolutely. That's what sets us apart from other restaurants. Keep up the good work, B.<p class="message sent">Will do, A. I'm proud to be part of this team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=79210727-4e9f-476e-a1c9-9391e76d789b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
