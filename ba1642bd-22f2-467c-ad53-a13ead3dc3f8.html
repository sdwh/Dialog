I think we may need more storage space in the future.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I agree. But have you considered how we should deploy it?<p class=message>Hmm, what do you mean by deployment?<p class="message sent">I mean, should we have a centralized database or a distributed one?<p class=message>Oh, I get it. I think we should go for the distributed one. It's more scalable.<p class="message sent">Interesting. But don't you think it's more complex to manage?<p class=message>Maybe, but it can also save us from a single point of failure.<p class="message sent">Good point. But what about performance? Will it have an impact?<p class=message>I don't think so. With the right configuration, it can be even faster.<p class="message sent">Okay, I see your point. But do we have the expertise to set it up?<p class=message>Well, we can always hire someone or learn it ourselves. It's not rocket science.<p class="message sent">Ha! I like your attitude. How about security? Will it be more vulnerable?<p class=message>Not necessarily. We can implement encryption and access control. Plus, we can also monitor it closely.<p class="message sent">Wow! You seem to have it all figured out. How about the cost?<p class=message>I think it may cost more upfront, but in the long run, it will be more cost-effective.<p class="message sent">Okay, I agree. But before we make any decisions, let's do some research and compare the options.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. I will start gathering more information about distributed database deployment.<p class="message sent">And I will do the same for centralized deployment. Let's meet again in a week and share our findings.<p class=message>Perfect! This will be a fun challenge.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm excited about it. Let's make our database great again!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ba15b5ff-2a1a-4d8b-af85-28d26737dde8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
