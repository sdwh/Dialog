I learned so much about the local cuisine and drinks.<p class=message>That sounds great! What did you bring back for us to try?<p class="message sent">I have some awamori, a type of Okinawan liquor, and some purple yams to make some taro smoothies.<p class=message>Wow, I've never had either of those before. How do we make the taro smoothies?<p class="message sent">It's really simple. Just blend the boiled taro with some milk and sugar until it's smooth and creamy.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! Can't wait to try it.<p class="message sent">And for the awamori, we can have it on the rocks or mix it with some pineapple juice for a sweeter taste.<p class=message>I think I'll go for the pineapple mix. Cheers!<p class="message sent">Cheers indeed! And don't forget to try the local delicacy, 'chanpurÅ«'. It's a stir-fry dish with lots of vegetables and meat.<p class=message>I'm already salivating. Let's definitely make that for the restaurant menu.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And we can also make 'goya champuru', a dish with bitter melon that's famous in Okinawa.<p class=message>Bitter melon? Hmm, sounds interesting. I'll trust your judgement on this one.<p class="message sent">I promise it's delicious! And we can use fresh tuna to make some 'tuna tataki', another local favorite.<p class=message>This trip was truly worthwhile. Thanks for bringing back so many great ideas for our restaurant.<p class="message sent">My pleasure! I'm excited to share the flavors of Okinawa with everyone back home.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=beb7527f-3664-4873-83cd-17cdc0e8f1a1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
