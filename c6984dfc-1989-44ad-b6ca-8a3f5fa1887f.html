How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, A! Just finishing up some croissants for the morning rush. How about you?<p class=message>I'm feeling good too. I'm about to start on some baguettes. They're always a crowd favorite.<p class="message sent">Oh, I agree. I love making croissants, but there's nothing like the smell of freshly baked bread.<p class=message>You're right. It's hard to beat the aroma of a good loaf of bread. Have you tried experimenting with any new recipes lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. I've been trying to perfect my cinnamon roll recipe. People seem to love them, but I want them to be just as good as the ones my grandmom used to make.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. Maybe we can collaborate and create a croissant-cinnamon roll hybrid.<p class="message sent">That could be interesting. We could call it a "croun."<p class=message>(laughs) A "croun," I like it. We could change the game with that one.<p class="message sent">Yeah, definitely. Speaking of changing the game, have you seen some of the new pastry trends coming out of Paris?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's new?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters there's the "cronut," which is half croissant, half donut. And then there's the "merveilleux," which is layers of meringue and whipped cream.<p class=message>Wow, those sound amazing. Maybe we can try to put our own spin on those and bring a taste of Paris to Avignon.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. I think our customers would love it.<p class=message>Hey, speaking of customers, look at the line forming outside. We better get back to work.<p class="message sent">Right. Let's finish up these pastries and make some people happy.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. It's great working with you, B.<p class="message sent">Same to you, A. Let's keep making magic in the kitchen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c6962e28-7ab9-4b1e-8e7b-cc96bdc228bf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
