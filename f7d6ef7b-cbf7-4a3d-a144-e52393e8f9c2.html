How's business going today, B?<p class="message sent">It's going really well, A. I have a feeling that we'll sell out of our chocolate desserts by the end of the day!<p class=message>That's fantastic news! I'm glad we've been working so well together.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's been great collaborating with you on these desserts. By the way, have you tried the new chocolate ganache tart that we made?<p class=message>Not yet, but it sounds delicious. Can I have a taste?<p class="message sent">Of course! Here you go.<p class=message>Mmm, this is amazing. The ganache is so creamy and rich.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it. And speaking of new creations, have you come up with any new pastry ideas lately?<p class=message>Actually, I have. I was thinking of making a mango coconut tart that would be perfect for summer.<p class="message sent">That sounds refreshing! Can I taste it when it's ready?<p class=message>Definitely. I'm planning to make a batch tomorrow, so I'll bring some over for you to try.<p class="message sent">Great, I can't wait! And in exchange, I'll make some dark chocolate truffles for you to sample.<p class=message>That sounds like a fair trade. I love how our collaboration leads to such tasty results.<p class="message sent">Me too. The combination of your pastries and my chocolates is a match made in dessert heaven.<p class=message>Agreed. I'm so glad we decided to open this shop on Sentosa Island. It's the perfect place to indulge in life's little pleasures.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And there's always room for more treats in the world, don't you think?<p class=message>Definitely. As far as I'm concerned, you can never have too many cakes and chocolates!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f7d014f3-7dd8-4912-be2a-38c8d8ae7462.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
