Nice day outside, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it is! So, where are we headed today?<p class=message>I'm going to Hiroshima. I've never been there before, so I'm really excited.<p class="message sent">Hiroshima? It's a beautiful city with a rich history. You'll love it.<p class=message>That's why I'm going there. I really want to see the Peace Memorial Park and the Hiroshima Castle.<p class="message sent">Those are great choices! You should also try the local cuisine. Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki is a must-try.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard of that. It's like a savory pancake or omelet, right?<p class="message sent">Exactly! You can find it in almost every restaurant in Hiroshima. And while you're at it, you should also try the local sake. It's called Hiroshima sake and it's really good.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. I'll definitely give it a try. By the way, have you ever been to Hiroshima yourself?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. I used to take tourists there all the time. It's always nice to see new people experience the city for the first time.<p class=message>That's great. I appreciate your recommendations. By the way, do you have any favorite music or radio stations?<p class="message sent">Oh, I listen to all kinds of music. But right now, I'm really into jazz. Have you ever listened to it?<p class=message>I have, a little bit. I didn't know it was popular here in Japan.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it is! There's a jazz festival in the nearby city of Miyajima every year. You should definitely check it out if you have the chance.<p class=message>I will. Thanks for the suggestion. Looks like we're almost there. Thanks for the ride and the conversation!<p class="message sent">No problem, anytime! Have a great time in Hiroshima!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a6cb0b56-db35-4a98-929c-2786c41d2430.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
