Would you mind telling me your name and what brought you here today?<p class="message sent message-content">Hi, officer. My name is Jack, and honestly, I'm not quite sure how I ended up here.<p class="message received message-content">Well, we have reason to believe that you were involved in a convenience store robbery last night. Do you have any knowledge of this?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh no, officer. That is definitely not me. I was actually at home last night catching up on my favorite TV show.<p class="message received message-content">Is there anyone who can confirm your alibi from last night?<p class="message sent message-content">Well, my cat Mr. Whiskers was with me, but I don't think he can vouch for me.<p class="message received message-content">I see. That could be a problem. But don't worry, we will need to look into this further before we come to any conclusions.<p class="message sent message-content">Thank you, officer. I understand completely.<p class="message received message-content">Can you tell me where you were before you went home last night?<p class="message sent message-content">Sure thing, officer. I was actually at the comic book store down the street. I just wanted to buy the latest Spider-Man comic.<p class="message received message-content">Ah, I see you're a fellow comic book fan. Who's your favorite superhero?<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely Batman. He's so dark and brooding, like me sometimes.<p class="message received message-content">(smiling) I can see the resemblance. Well, thank you for your cooperation, Jack. We will be in touch soon.<p class="message sent message-content">No problem, officer. I'll be more than happy to help clear my name.<p class="message received message-content">(walks away) This one's a little different than the usual suspects we get. I'm definitely intrigued.<p class="message sent message-content">(to himself) That was close. I'm glad I thought of the comic book store alibi. Time to lay low for a bit.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=08331dea-900c-4b8f-9f4d-d3cd2de03bca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
