How's it going?<p class="message sent">Good! How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. So, what's the schedule looking like for the next few months?<p class="message sent">Well, we've got a few offers on the table. One is for a comedy tour in the UK.<p class=message>Oh, awesome! I love performing in the UK. What's the itinerary?<p class="message sent">It's a two-week tour, hitting up major cities like London, Manchester, and Glasgow.<p class=message>Sounds like a blast. What about the venue sizes?<p class="message sent">They range from around 500 seats to 2,500 seats. We're trying to keep it intimate but also give you the chance to play to big audiences.<p class=message>Perfect, that's exactly what I'm looking for. Any other options?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we've also been asked to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.<p class=message>The Fringe! That's huge. What's the show looking like?<p class="message sent">They're giving us a prime time slot at a 300 seat venue. We've gotta make sure it's a killer show.<p class=message>No pressure, right?<p class="message sent">(laughs) None at all.<p class=message>So, what's the timeline like for deciding on these offers?<p class="message sent">We've got a few days to make the final call. Which one are you leaning towards?<p class=message>Honestly, I think the Fringe Festival would be an incredible opportunity. It's such a unique and fun atmosphere.<p class="message sent">I agree. And who knows, maybe we'll get to try some haggis while we're there.<p class=message>(laughs) I'll stick to the vegetarian options, thank you very much.<p class="message sent">Duly noted. Let's make it happen then.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2baf2daa-b2b7-4512-b78d-d0dd1dd9d91c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
