Our strategy is to make sure that the products that are commonly purchased together are placed near each other.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. Can you give me an example?<p class=message>Sure. For instance, we place peanut butter and jelly next to each other since they're commonly purchased together.<p class="message sent">I see where you're going with this. Do you also take seasons into consideration?<p class=message>Absolutely. Our display changes depending on the time of year. For instance, during summer, we put more barbecue sauces on display.<p class="message sent">That's great. What about colors? Do you follow a specific color scheme?<p class=message>Not necessarily, but we make sure that the products don't clash with each other. We also try to make the displays look visually appealing.<p class="message sent">I see. Do you ever experiment with different display strategies?<p class=message>Definitely. We're always trying new things to see if they work better than what we're currently doing.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Well, thank you for sharing your strategy with me!<p class=message>You're welcome! Feel free to come by any time if you have more questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=925ef5b1-67bb-4281-b09f-e9062363ad64.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
