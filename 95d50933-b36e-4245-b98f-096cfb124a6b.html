It's a pleasure to work with you again today.<p class="message sent">Morning, A. Likewise. I heard we have a large tea party scheduled for this afternoon.<p class=message>Yes, we do. I'm glad we'll have plenty of orders to keep us busy. What type of tea do you recommend with our Osmanthus cake?<p class="message sent">I think a nice Oolong tea would complement its floral flavor well. How about you?<p class=message>I agree. I'll prepare the cake, and you can start brewing the tea. Do you have a favorite type of tea to prepare?<p class="message sent">Definitely Pu-erh tea. It has such bold and complex flavors, and the brewing process is so unique.<p class=message>I see. I prefer the lighter teas, such as White tea. The delicate taste and aroma are perfect for enjoying with our mooncakes.<p class="message sent">That's a good choice. Have you tried our new Jasmine Green tea, though? It has a lovely floral scent and refreshing taste.<p class=message>I haven't had the chance yet, but I'd love to try it. Maybe we can make some for ourselves after we finish preparing for the party.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Oh, I almost forgot â€“ we have a request for a gluten-free option for the party. Do you have any ideas?<p class=message>Yes, we do have a recipe for red bean mochi that's naturally gluten-free. It's a bit time-consuming to make, but definitely worth it.<p class="message sent">That's perfect. I'll inform the customer that we can accommodate their dietary needs. Thank you for your help, A.<p class=message>Of course, B. That's what colleagues are for. Let's get started on making the best tea and pastries for our customers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=95d22343-bff2-42f0-ad94-32e9d7ad80ca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
