I'm A, the musician tonight.<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm B. I'm excited to hear you play tonight!<p class=message>Thank you, B! I've been practicing for weeks to make sure it's perfect.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of work. What kind of music will you be playing?<p class=message>I'll be playing a mix of classical and contemporary pieces. I hope you'll enjoy it.<p class="message sent">I'm sure I will! How did you become a musician?<p class=message>I've been playing music since I was a child. My parents were both musicians and they inspired me.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. Do you play any other instruments besides the one you'll be playing tonight?<p class=message>Yes, I play ten different instruments. But my favorite is the one I'll be playing tonight.<p class="message sent">Wow! You're very talented. How do you keep calm before performing in front of such a large crowd?<p class=message>I do some breathing exercises and remind myself that I love playing music. Plus, the Sydney Opera House is such a beautiful venue, it's a privilege to be able to play here.<p class="message sent">I bet it is! Have you ever had any embarrassing moments on stage?<p class=message>Oh yes, one time I forgot the words to a song and had to ad-lib. It was pretty embarrassing, but the audience seemed to enjoy it.<p class="message sent">It's always good to be able to improvise. Do you have any other performances lined up after this one?<p class=message>Yes, I have a few concerts in different cities over the next few weeks. It's a busy schedule, but I love it.<p class="message sent">That sounds exciting. What advice would you give to young musicians who want to become successful like you?<p class=message>Practice as much as you can, listen to a lot of different types of music, and never give up on your dreams. Hard work pays off.<p class="message sent">That's great advice. Thank you for sharing! I can't wait to hear you play tonight.<p class=message>It was my pleasure, B. And thank you for coming to the concert. I hope you have a great time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=98162d22-e5e3-465e-ba54-5ddfac215682.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
