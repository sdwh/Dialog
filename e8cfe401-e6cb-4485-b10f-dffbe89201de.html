Nice to meet you, and you're the cybersecurity expert, right?<p class=message>Correct! It's good to see you taking network security seriously.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, we take it very seriously. Any tips on how to better manage network risks?<p class=message>Well, one easy tip is to make sure all employees are educated on basic security protocols.<p class="message sent">That's a great suggestion. We can also implement two-factor authentication for our systems.<p class=message>Yes, that would add an extra layer of security. Another idea is to use firewalls to protect our network from unwanted access.<p class="message sent">That's already in place, but we can always improve it further. What do you think about using a VPN tunnel for employees who work from home?<p class=message>That's another great idea! It's important to secure remote access since it can pose a greater risk.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And what do you think about monitoring our network for suspicious activity?<p class=message>That's essential. We have to be proactive in detecting and responding to attacks.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's better to be safe than sorry. Thanks for sharing your insights with me.<p class=message>My pleasure. Let's continue working together to ensure the security of our network.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e8cdd94d-f9bb-4a18-97db-de5ca3d82132.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
