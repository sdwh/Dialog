How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad! How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. So, have you traveled overseas?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have been to a few countries, how about you?<p class=message>Same here! I absolutely fell in love with the culture in Japan.<p class="message sent">Ah, Japan! You know, they have a really interesting custom of bowing when they greet each other.<p class=message>Yes! That's so true! Did you also know that it's considered rude to leave chopsticks standing up in a bowl of rice?<p class="message sent">No way! I had no idea.<p class=message>It's funny how every culture has their own unique customs and etiquette.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And it's so important to be aware of them when traveling to a foreign country.<p class=message>For sure! I remember feeling really awkward when I accidentally hugged someone in France instead of shaking their hand!<p class="message sent">Haha, I can imagine! In India, it's considered respectful to remove your shoes when entering someone's home.<p class=message>Interesting! In the US, shaking hands is pretty standard, but some people take it to the next level with fist bumps and high-fives!<p class="message sent">I've noticed that too! It's a lot of fun.<p class=message>So, do you have any other memorable cultural experiences from your travels?<p class="message sent">Well, in South Korea, it's considered rude to pour your own drink, so if someone else is pouring, you should hold your cup with both hands.<p class=message>Oh wow, I had no idea! It's fascinating how these little things can make a big difference.<p class="message sent">Totally! It's all about respecting and understanding each other's cultures.<p class=message>Definitely! Well, it's been great chatting with you about this. Let's plan our next overseas adventure soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ceabac10-2e9f-49ff-8b54-91d874ba9908.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
