How's the audit going?<p class="message sent">Hello! It's going well, just trying to make sure everything is secured and follows ISO 27001 standards.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, have you discovered anything interesting so far?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I found out that some employees were still using weak passwords. But we quickly enforced them to change it to a stronger one.<p class=message>Yes, that's important. Any funny incidents during the audit?<p class="message sent">Well, I did come across a server named after a character from Game of Thrones. That brought a smile to my face.<p class=message>Haha! That's cool. It's always interesting to see the creativity of the IT team. Did you find any areas that need improvement?<p class="message sent">Yes, there were a few communication gaps between different departments. But we suggested solutions to improve it.<p class=message>Good job. It's great to see that we proactively identify issues and come up with solutions. Do you have any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">I'm planning to play soccer with my friends. How about you?<p class=message>I'm thinking of going hiking with my family. Hopefully, the weather allows for it. Do you play soccer often?<p class="message sent">Yes, I try to play every weekend. It's a good way to stay active and de-stress after a busy week at work.<p class=message>That sounds nice. Hiking is also a great way to enjoy nature and clear your mind. Do you have any favorite hiking spots?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I love hiking on a trail that leads to a waterfall. It's breathtaking and refreshing.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I haven't tried a waterfall hike yet, but it's on my bucket list. Enjoy your soccer game and have a great weekend!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=493396a4-ed3d-4349-bce9-46bdcc6ec09c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
