How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Hello, A! It was great, thank you. How about yours?<p class=message>It was fantastic! By the way, thank you for taking time to meet with me today to discuss the ad campaign.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. I'm excited to hear your ideas.<p class=message>Great! So, first off, I think we should have a catchy jingle that will stick in people's heads.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. Do you have a sample?<p class=message>Actually, I do. *humming* "I'm lovin' it." You've probably heard it before.<p class="message sent">Of course! So, what other ideas do you have?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of having a funny commercial that will go viral on social media.<p class="message sent">Ooh, I like that. What kind of humor were you thinking?<p class=message>Maybe something like a talking animal that represents your brand. Or we could have a spoof of a popular movie.<p class="message sent">That sounds hilarious. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class=message>Yes, I think we should have a celebrity endorsement. It will give your brand more credibility and exposure.<p class="message sent">I agree, but do you think we can afford it?<p class=message>Absolutely. We don't have to get a famous A-lister. We can reach out to a rising star or an influencer with a huge following.<p class="message sent">That's a great plan. I'm impressed with your creative ideas.<p class=message>Thank you. I'm confident that our campaign will be successful.<p class="message sent">Me too. Thank you for presenting your ideas. I look forward to working with you.<p class=message>Likewise, B. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9de0ff7b-7993-49ef-ba52-16a0b1b7e6c2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
