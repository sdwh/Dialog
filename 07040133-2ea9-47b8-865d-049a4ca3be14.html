But we work well together so it shouldn't be a big deal.<p class=message>Absolutely! Say, have you heard about that new movie that just came out?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had the chance to catch up on the latest movies. What's it about?<p class=message>It's a comedy about two guys who start a car repair shop and get into some crazy trouble.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a fun time. I think I'll take my wife to see it this weekend.<p class=message>Good idea. Have you noticed any issues with the engine on this tractor?<p class="message sent">Actually, it's the transmission that needs some work, but I've got it under control.<p class=message>Nice, let me know if you need any help. By the way, did I tell you about my fishing trip last week?<p class="message sent">No, you didn't. How was it?<p class=message>It was awesome! Caught a bunch of rainbow trout and had a great time with my buddies.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a blast. I haven't been fishing in ages. Maybe we should plan a trip one of these days.<p class=message>Definitely! We could take a day off and hit up the lake nearby.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I'll bring the beer!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0700b078-9cfc-4620-86db-d988a006f249.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
