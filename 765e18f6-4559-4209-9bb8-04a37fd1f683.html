This is one of the most scenic bridges in the world.<p class="message sent">Thanks for driving me here, A. The view is amazing!<p class=message>Absolutely! Did you know that the bridge was built in 1937 and it took four years to complete?<p class="message sent">That's incredible! How do they maintain it in such great condition?<p class=message>Well, they have a special paint that's orange-red called international orange. It helps protect the bridge from the salty mist that comes from the bay.<p class="message sent">Interesting! By the way, what's that island over there?<p class=message>That's Alcatraz Island. It used to be a prison and now it's a popular tourist attraction.<p class="message sent">I've heard about that! Did any famous prisoners escape from there?<p class=message>Yes, three prisoners escaped in 1962 and they were never found. It's still a mystery to this day!<p class="message sent">Wow, that's crazy! Hey, can we stop and take a picture of the bridge?<p class=message>Of course! There's a great spot just up ahead.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! You're the best tour guide ever!<p class=message>(laughs) No problem, B! It's always a pleasure to show off this beautiful city.<p class="message sent">I can see why. San Francisco is definitely one of my favorite places to visit.<p class=message>Mine too! Let's make sure we come back and see more of it.<p class="message sent">Definitely! I would love to explore more of the city with you.<p class=message>Sounds great, B! Let's make a plan for next time.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Thanks again for showing me around, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B! Safe travels back home.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=765a9d7c-0219-4adc-b9f7-c61e2ec59503.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
