What size are you looking for?<p class=message>I think I need a medium instead of a small.<p class="message sent">Great, let me see what we have in the back. So, have you found anything else you like in the store?<p class=message>Yes, actually. I've been eyeing those cute floral dresses over there.<p class="message sent">Oh, those are lovely! Would you like me to bring one in the fitting room for you to try on?<p class=message>That would be amazing, thank you! Do you think it would look good on me?<p class="message sent">I think it would look great on you! Plus, the yellow flowers on it would complement your skin tone really well.<p class=message>(smiling) You're too kind. So how long have you been working here?<p class="message sent">I've been working at this store for about a year now. It's been really fun, and I've been able to help a lot of customers find clothes they like.<p class=message>That's awesome. Do you have any tips for me on how to find the perfect outfit?<p class="message sent">Well, I like to start with picking a color that I feel comfortable wearing, and then looking for styles that flatter my body shape. And don't forget to accessorize!<p class=message>Good tips! I'll have to keep those in mind. (looks in the mirror with the new dress on) Wow, I love it! Thank you so much for your help.<p class="message sent">I'm so glad you like it! You look stunning. Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>No, that's all for now. Thanks again for your help, I appreciate it.<p class="message sent">My pleasure! Have a great day, and enjoy your new clothes!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e3624d90-b3a6-4bde-85f8-b0a3680e84c3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
