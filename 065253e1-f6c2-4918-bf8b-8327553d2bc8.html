How's your day so far?<p class="message sent">It's been busy, A, but I am excited to work on this project with you. Have you made any progress with the SQL Server?<p class=message>Yes, I have set up the database and imported some data. We can start working on the queries.<p class="message sent">Excellent! Let's get to it. By the way, have you heard about the new coffee shop that opened nearby?<p class=message>Oh, really? I haven't heard about it. What's special about it?<p class="message sent">They have this unique blend of coffee that they make with locally sourced beans. I tried it yesterday, and it was amazing!<p class=message>That sounds great. We should go there sometime.<p class="message sent">Definitely! So, what query do you want to work on first?<p class=message>Let's start with the SELECT statement for the customer table. We can join it with the orders table to get the total amount spent by each customer.<p class="message sent">Good idea! That will give us some useful insights into the data. By the way, have you watched any good movies recently?<p class=message>Yes, I watched the latest sci-fi movie last weekend. The special effects were really impressive.<p class="message sent">Oh, I heard about that one. I am planning to watch it soon. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class=message>No problem. Alright, let's test the query for the average order amount. It should show us the typical spending behavior of the customers.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Hey, it's almost lunchtime. Are you hungry?<p class=message>Yes, I am. Do you have any suggestions for a good place to eat?<p class="message sent">How about the new sushi place that opened across the street? I tried it last week, and it was delicious.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. Let's finish up this query, and then we can take a break for lunch.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's dive back into the code.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=065095b4-78a8-4ec5-ba7f-e2ee3ed9ca2f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
