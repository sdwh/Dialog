I seem to have found myself in a bit of trouble.<p class="message received message-content">Well, let's see what we can do to help you out. Can you tell me why you were caught stealing that bike?<p class="message sent message-content">Honestly, officer, it was a moment of weakness. I just needed to get somewhere quickly and I saw the bike unlocked.<p class="message received message-content">Right, well stealing is never the answer. You realize that you could have just borrowed someone's bike, right?<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, I know that now. I just wasn't thinking straight.<p class="message received message-content">Well, we'll have to process you for the theft, but I'll see what I can do to make your stay as comfortable as possible.<p class="message sent message-content">Really? Thanks, officer. I appreciate it.<p class="message received message-content">Alright, let's get started. Do you have any other crimes you'd like to confess to?<p class="message sent message-content">No way, officer. I think I've done enough damage for one day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0cddf184-c690-4277-ad12-c5ffa672e222.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
