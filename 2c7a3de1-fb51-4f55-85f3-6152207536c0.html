I'll do my best to assist you. What exactly are you looking for?<p class=message>Well, I wanted to know the quickest route to get to the Taipei 101 building from the airport.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. You'll want to take the Taoyuan Airport MRT line and transfer to the Taipei Metro Blue Line at the Taipei Main Station. From there, take the Blue Line to the Taipei City Hall Station and it's just a short walk from there to Taipei 101.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds easy enough. Are there any cool sights to see along the way?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! You'll pass through some bustling areas like Zhongshan and Xinyi, which are filled with shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Plus, you'll get a great view of the city from the train window.<p class=message>So, what's the frequency of the trains?<p class="message sent">The frequency of the trains varies depending on the time of day, but during rush hour they come every 2-3 minutes, and during off-peak hours they usually run every 5-10 minutes.<p class=message>Wow, that's pretty frequent. What about the cost? Is it expensive?<p class="message sent">Not at all! The cost of a one-way trip from the airport to Taipei City Hall Station is only around NT$160, which is about $5 USD.<p class=message>That's way cheaper than I expected. Thanks for all the great info, you've been a huge help!<p class="message sent">No problem, glad I could assist you. Have a safe and enjoyable trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2c73619e-f665-40be-a6f8-512f96f139c5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
