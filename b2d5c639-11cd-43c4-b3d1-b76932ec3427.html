I found some errors and inconsistencies in the source code.<p class=message>Oh no! That doesn't sound good. What did you find?<p class="message sent">Well, there were some variables that were not properly initialized and some inconsistent formatting.<p class=message>Ah, that's not too bad. It's normal to have some errors here and there. Did you document all your findings?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. And I also came up with some suggested solutions for the issues I found.<p class=message>Great. That makes things easier for us. Did you talk to the original developer who wrote the code?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. We went through the issues together and he agreed that there were problems.<p class=message>Awesome. So what's the next step?<p class="message sent">We need to start fixing the problems. We can either fix the code ourselves, or create a ticket for the original developer to fix them.<p class=message>Yeah, that sounds like a plan. What do you need from me?<p class="message sent">Well, since you have more experience, I was hoping you could review my suggested solutions before we start.<p class=message>Of course. Let's go through them together and make sure they're the best solutions for these issues.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Thanks for your help, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B. It's always good to have consistent code and make sure we deliver quality software.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b2d163fe-c5d9-4d4a-9d60-92f8c8a01469.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
