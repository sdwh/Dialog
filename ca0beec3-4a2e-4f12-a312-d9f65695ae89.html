Have you decided on our travel itinerary yet?<p class="message sent">Not really, any suggestions?<p class=message>How about we visit Japan? I heard it's a beautiful country.<p class="message sent">I agree, but what places should we go to?<p class=message>We could go to Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. They're all popular tourist spots.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me! What about our accommodation?<p class=message>I found a few hotels online. Do you have any preferences?<p class="message sent">I don't want anything too expensive or too shabby. Something reasonable, ya know?<p class=message>How about this hotel I found? It's a four-star hotel and the price is reasonable.<p class="message sent">That looks great! Does it include breakfast?<p class=message>Yes, it does! Plus, it's near public transportation, so it's convenient for us.<p class="message sent">Awesome! How about the activities we'll do there?<p class=message>We can go sightseeing, try out some local cuisine, and shopping.<p class="message sent">Sounds fantastic! Do we need to buy tickets for attractions or anything?<p class=message>Yes, we should buy tickets in advance for popular attractions, so we don't have to wait in long lines.<p class="message sent">Good idea! How about the budget? How much should we set aside for the whole trip?<p class=message>I did some rough calculations, and I think we should set aside around $2000 each, including flights, accommodation, and daily expenses.<p class="message sent">That seems reasonable. When should we book the trip?<p class=message>We should book the flights and accommodation as soon as possible to get the best deals. How about two months from now?<p class="message sent">Perfect! I'm excited for this trip! Thanks for planning it with me.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help! Let's make some unforgettable memories!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ca05ad8c-afdb-4874-aff7-188de4bae7d5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
