How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Well, to be honest, not great. I've been feeling really run-down and tired lately.<p class=message>I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what symptoms you're experiencing?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been having headaches, stomach pains, and just feeling generally unwell.<p class=message>Hmm, it sounds like you might have a case of the flu. Let's do some tests and see if we can get to the bottom of it.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I really appreciate it. I was worried it could be something more serious.<p class=message>No problem, we're here to make sure you're taken care of.
