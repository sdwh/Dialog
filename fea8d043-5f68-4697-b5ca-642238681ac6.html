I'm stuck here in this police station.<p class=message>Ah, yes. The joy of being a suspect. So, what brings you here today?<p class="message sent">Apparently, I was caught red-handed stealing a box of donuts from the convenience store.<p class=message>Well, you can't blame them for being protective of their food supply.<p class="message sent">I know, I know. But I was really hungry, and those donuts looked so delicious.<p class=message>I understand your pain, but stealing is not the solution. Let's get down to business, shall we?<p class="message sent">Sure. What do you want to ask me first?<p class=message>Can you tell me what happened before you got caught stealing?<p class="message sent">Well, I was walking down the street and saw the store. I couldn't resist going in and checking out what they had. Then, I saw the donuts, and my hunger took over.<p class=message>I see. Do you realize what you did was illegal?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. But in my defense, those donuts were calling my name!<p class=message>(Laughs) If only those donuts could talk, they would probably say the same thing. Alright, let's wrap this up. Any last words?<p class="message sent">Just that I'm sorry for my actions, and that I won't do it again. And if possible, can I request a box of those delicious donuts as my punishment?<p class=message>(Laughs) Nice try, but I think we'll stick to a warning for now. Thanks for cooperating with us, and have a good day.<p class="message sent">Thank you. Same to you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fea2d75b-1d58-4879-99a3-0b91a5de61ca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
