How's everyone doing today?<p class="message sent">Great, except I had too much coffee this morning and my hands won't stop shaking.<p class=message>Oh, no! Maybe you should switch to tea or water next time.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I definitely need to cut back. Anyway, what are we learning today?<p class=message>We're going to continue our discussion on Shakespeare's sonnets. Last time we talked about love, but today we're going to focus on the theme of time.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. I remember reading one of his sonnets about time and death.<p class=message>Yes, that's a common theme in his work. It's amazing how he was able to capture such deep emotions and ideas in just a few lines of poetry.<p class="message sent">Speaking of deep emotions, did you hear about the new romantic comedy movie coming out this weekend?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class="message sent">It's called "Love on the Rocks". It's about a young couple who fall in love over a shared love of rock music, but their relationship is tested when one of them starts to become famous.<p class=message>Sounds like a fun movie to watch with some popcorn. Maybe we should all go see it together this weekend.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! It would be a fun way to bond as a class outside of the classroom.<p class=message>Alright, let's plan on it then. Now, back to Shakespeare. Let's open up our textbooks and dive into his beautiful language once again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e72d629d-5ef2-439f-b8c8-bd41a873e6cc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
