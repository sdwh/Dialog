I'm a foodie and I heard that this restaurant offers Great Britain cuisines. Can you tell me what dishes are included?<p class="message sent">Certainly! We have Yorkshire pudding, fish and chips, Shepherd's pie, and Cornish pasty on our menu. Have you tried any of these before?<p class=message>Oh yes, I've had fish and chips before, but I've never heard of Shepherd's pie or Cornish pasty. What are they like?<p class="message sent">Shepherd's pie is made with ground beef and mashed potatoes, and sometimes carrots and peas. It's a hearty and comforting dish. Cornish pasty is a savory pastry filled with meat and vegetables, like a handheld pie.<p class=message>That sounds really interesting. I think I'll have to try them both! Do you have a personal favorite among these dishes?<p class="message sent">Definitely the Yorkshire pudding. It's a traditional British side dish made with a batter of milk, flour, and eggs that's baked until it's crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It's perfect with gravy.<p class=message>Wow, I've never had that before either! It all sounds delicious. I think I'll have to come back here a few times just to try everything.<p class="message sent">We'd love to have you back! And don't forget to try our desserts, like sticky toffee pudding and Eton mess.<p class=message>Of course, I wouldn't miss out on dessert. Thanks for telling me about these dishes!<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6d2bcb8b-1601-407b-944e-b784aacf0134.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
