Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, my boss told me that our company needs to be compliant with ISO 27001, and I have no idea where to start.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I went through a similar process last year. It's not that difficult, just takes a bit of time and effort.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Any advice on how to get started?<p class="message sent">First, you need to understand the requirements of the standard. Have you read the document yet?<p class=message>No, I haven't. It looks boring.<p class="message sent">(laughs) It can be, but it's the foundation of the whole thing. You need to know what you're dealing with.<p class=message>Alright, I'll take a look at it. What else should I know?<p class="message sent">You'll need to identify the risks that your company faces, and come up with a plan to manage them. That's where you'll spend most of your time.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work. Is it necessary?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's not just about compliance, it's about making your company more secure and resilient.<p class=message>I can see that. So, once we have a plan in place, what's next?<p class="message sent">You'll need to implement the controls that you've identified in your plan. This is where you'll need to involve all the departments in your company.<p class=message>That's true. It's not just an IT thing, right?<p class="message sent">Nope, it's a company-wide effort. Everyone needs to be on board.<p class=message>Got it. Once everything is implemented, what happens then?<p class="message sent">You'll need to monitor and review your controls on a regular basis to ensure that they're working effectively. And every year, you'll have an external auditor come and assess your compliance.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work. But I can see how important it is for our company's security.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And it's a good selling point for your clients, too. They'll feel more confident working with a secure company.<p class=message>You're right. Thanks for explaining all of this to me, B. It's not as daunting as I thought.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. Just let me know if you need any further advice.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=758bb05c-2c3f-40c0-991f-2f9c62491e9d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
