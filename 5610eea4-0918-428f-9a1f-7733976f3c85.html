How's it going?<p class="message sent">Good, good. Just trying to keep up with these guests and the updates on the scoreboard.<p class=message>Yeah, it's tough huh? I mean, we have to make sure we're updating the inning, home team, ball count, strike count, and outs too.<p class="message sent">Don't forget about updating the scores for both teams too!<p class=message>Right, right. But you know what's funny? Every time I hear "strike" or "out" I can't help but think of that old game show catchphrase, "Strike one! Strike two! Strike three! You're out!"<p class="message sent">Haha, that always gets me too. But sometimes I feel like the umpire is taking too long to call a strike or an out.<p class=message>Yeah, and when it comes to balls, I just want to yell out "ball four! Take your base!"<p class="message sent">Oh man, that would be great. Maybe we can do a sound effect or something to make it seem like commentator yelling out the play-by-play.<p class=message>Yes! Let's do it. And who knows, maybe we'll become famous commentators ourselves.<p class="message sent">Haha, that would be a dream come true. But for now, let's just focus on keeping the scoreboard up-to-date and making sure the guests have a great time at the game.<p class=message>Agreed. Alright, let's get back to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=560f6e6b-98c8-45e6-afef-d40e128628c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
