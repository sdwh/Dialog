It’s a mystery story.<p class="message received message-content">Ooh, sounds interesting. What’s it about?<p class="message sent message-content">It’s about a detective trying to solve a crime that happened in a small town.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds like a classic plot. I love mysteries.<p class="message sent message-content">Me too! It’s so much fun trying to guess who did it before the detective reveals the answer.<p class="message received message-content">I agree. Have you read any other mystery books recently?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I just finished one about a group of friends investigating a haunted house.<p class="message received message-content">Oh, I think I’ve read that one. Did you like it?<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, it was pretty scary, but also funny in some parts.<p class="message received message-content">That's great. Have you ever considered writing your own mystery story?<p class="message sent message-content">Actually, I have. I’ve been working on a story for a while now, but I’m not sure how it’s going to end.<p class="message received message-content">Don't worry, that happens to many writers. Just keep writing and the story will find its way.<p class="message sent message-content">Thanks for the advice. I’ll keep that in mind.<p class="message received message-content">No problem. By the way, have you had a chance to check out the library’s new book club?<p class="message sent message-content">No, I haven't. What is it about?<p class="message received message-content">It’s a group of people who read and discuss a book together once a month. I’m already a member and we’re reading a romance novel this month.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds like fun. I’ll definitely look into joining.<p class="message received message-content">Great! The more the merrier. Do you have any favorite books or authors?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I really enjoy reading J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. The characters and world she created are so immersive.<p class="message received message-content">I agree. Those books are timeless classics. Well, I better get back to my work. Have a good day!<p class="message sent message-content">Thanks, you too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0d8716c1-58d8-4db6-8d37-3a3ad2f3b945.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
