Looks like you had quite the race earlier.<p class=message>Yeah, I did. Thanks for taking such good care of my baby.<p class="message sent">No problem, that's what I'm here for. So, what happened out there?<p class=message>Well, I got a little too aggressive with the turns and ended up clipping the wall.<p class="message sent">I see. Well, considering the shape your car is in, you got out pretty lucky.<p class=message>Yeah, you're right. Good thing you're around to keep me in one piece.<p class="message sent">Ha! I see your ego is doing just fine.<p class=message>Hey, I never claimed to be perfect. But I do appreciate a little friendly ribbing every now and then.<p class="message sent">Speaking of friendly ribbing, have you heard about the new guy on the circuit? They call him "Lightning Lips" because he won't stop talking!<p class=message>Oh man, I hope I don't have to talk to him anytime soon. I need my peace and quiet to focus.<p class="message sent">Ha! You sound like an old man. But I hear you, it's important to stay focused.<p class=message>You know it. So, when do you think my car will be ready to go again?<p class="message sent">Give me another thirty minutes and it should be good as new.<p class=message>Awesome, thanks again B. You rock.<p class="message sent">No problem A, glad I could help. And hey, good luck in your next race. Maybe try to keep it away from the walls this time, huh?<p class=message>You got it. See you around, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fd8de2bd-3afa-4f85-8fc5-37f8fe845f77.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
