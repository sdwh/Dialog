I am excited to finally start testing out our new pastry recipe today.<p class="message sent">Hi there! I can't wait to get started as well. What kind of pastry are we making today?<p class=message>We are making a cream cheese filled croissant. It's a bit of a twist on the classic croissant recipe.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that sounds delicious. I'm curious to see how the cream cheese filling affects the flakiness of the pastry.<p class=message>Yes, it will definitely add some moisture to the croissant. But we've adjusted the recipe to account for that, so it should still come out light and crispy.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. So, what's our first step?<p class=message>First, we need to mix the dough. Then we roll it out and let it chill for a bit before adding the butter.<p class="message sent">Got it. And how long do we have to wait for the dough to chill?<p class=message>About half an hour. In the meantime, we can prepare the cream cheese filling.<p class="message sent">Perfect. And what else do we need to do to make sure the croissants come out perfect?<p class=message>Well, we'll need to make sure the butter is evenly distributed in the dough, and we'll have to be careful not to overwork it as we're rolling it out.<p class="message sent">Right, those are important things to keep in mind. But I think we're up for the challenge. Let's get started!<p class=message>Agreed. I'm excited to see how our recipe turns out. And if all goes well, we can add it to our menu at the caf√©.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I can already imagine the smell of fresh croissants wafting through the bakery.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7b000260-87be-47af-962e-56d37b797d2c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
