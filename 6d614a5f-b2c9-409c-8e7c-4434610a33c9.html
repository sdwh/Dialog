Have you ever tried churros before?<p class="message sent">Hello A! Yes, I have. I once had them while on a trip to Spain. They were amazing!<p class=message>I completely agree. The first time I had churros was in Mexico, and I instantly fell in love with them.<p class="message sent">Oh, Mexico! That must have been an experience for your taste buds.<p class=message>Absolutely! The churros were really delicious. It was an explosion of flavors in my mouth.<p class="message sent">I know what you mean. I particularly enjoy them dipped in hot chocolate. It's the perfect combination.<p class=message>That sounds so good! I've heard that churros can also be served with caramel or strawberry sauce.<p class="message sent">That's right. I've tried them with caramel, and they were just as delicious as with chocolate. I haven't had them with strawberry sauce yet, though.<p class=message>I guess we have something to look forward to the next time we have churros!<p class="message sent">Definitely! I'm really looking forward to trying them with some strawberry sauce. Do you know any good places nearby that serve churros?<p class=message>Yes! There's a little caf√© by the park that serves amazing churros with chocolate sauce. We should go there sometime.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! I can't wait to try them. How many churros do you usually eat?<p class=message>Oh, I can easily eat four or five, depending on the size. What about you?<p class="message sent">Haha! I think I can eat a similar amount. They're so irresistible.<p class=message>That's so true! Churros are definitely one of my favorite desserts.<p class="message sent">Mine too! I'm already salivating just thinking about them.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6d60a08f-2db6-4905-aefa-1944e29212ca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
