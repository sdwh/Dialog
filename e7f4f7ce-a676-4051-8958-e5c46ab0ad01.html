We have some amazing fresh fruits and vegetables today.<p class="message sent">Oh, really? What's in season right now?<p class=message>Well, we have some gorgeous summer peaches and plums, as well as juicy watermelons and crisp green beans.<p class="message sent">Yum, I'll take some of each! Do you have any recommendations for recipes?<p class=message>Definitely! For the peaches and plums, they're perfect for a refreshing summer salad with some arugula and goat cheese.

We have our own website where we list all of our products and also share some cooking tips and tricks.<p class="message sent">Excellent, I'll definitely check that out.
