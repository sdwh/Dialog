Do you need any help with the baked goods or pastries?<p class="message sent">No, but thanks for offering! I'm the ice cream maker here. Want a sample of our newest flavor?<p class=message>Of course! What's the flavor?<p class="message sent">It's called "Key Lime Pie." It's got chunks of graham cracker crust and swirls of tangy lime curd running through it.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. Let me grab a spoon.<p class="message sent">So, what's your favorite pastry here?<p class=message>I'm a fan of the citrus tart. It's got a buttery shortbread crust and a bright lemon filling. It's the perfect balance of sweet and sour.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! Do you make it here?<p class=message>Yes, I do. I've been here at the bakery for four years now, so I've got a good handle on our top-selling desserts.<p class="message sent">That's impressive! I've only been here a month, but I feel like I'm getting the hang of the ice cream game.<p class=message>Definitely. I think it's fascinating how we both play with fresh ingredients and unique flavors. It keeps things exciting.<p class="message sent">And we both have our fair share of regulars who come in every week for their favorites.<p class=message>Yes, that's true. I always love seeing the same faces and hearing their feedback.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, have you tried our salted caramel ice cream yet?<p class=message>Oh my goodness, yes. That's my absolute favorite. The creamy caramel with the little kick of salt - it's perfection.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it! And your citrus tart is definitely on my list for after my shift.<p class=message>Happy to hear it! And if you ever want to collaborate and make a Key Lime Tart with me, just let me know.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. It's always fun to experiment with new recipes.<p class=message>Exactly. Well, I better get back to the oven. It was great chatting with you!<p class="message sent">You too. Have a good rest of your shift!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=26ed5fd3-ed58-4678-837a-2503c397dbe8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
