Another day of bread baking ahead of us.<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too! Yes, and I can already smell the fresh dough. It's going to be a good day.<p class=message>I sure hope so. I'm excited to try out this new recipe I found. It's supposed to be a healthier bread with a unique taste.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting! You know what would pair perfectly with that? Our new Kenyan coffee blend.<p class=message>I have tried that coffee, and it is amazing! It has a fruity and floral taste that I've never experienced before.<p class="message sent">Exactly! That's what I thought when I first tried it too. We should make a special combo deal with your new bread and our Kenyan coffee. How about calling it "The London Special"?<p class=message>I love it! That's an excellent marketing strategy. I'm sure our customers will enjoy the combination.<p class="message sent">Speaking of customers, have you seen that regular customer who always orders the same thing, croissants and cappuccino?<p class=message>You mean Sarah? Yes, I've seen her. She's very particular about her order, always the same.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's the one. I thought of a friendly prank to play on her. Instead of a cappuccino, I'll put in a tiny bit of hot sauce in her latte.<p class=message>Oh, that's so devious! But I like it. Let's see how she reacts to her "spicy latte."<p class="message sent">Haha, she'll probably think it's some new fancy latte flavor until the heat kicks in.<p class=message>Speaking of heat, why is it so warm in here today? Can we turn the AC down?<p class="message sent">One of our customers complained that it was too cold last time. Maybe we should have a vote and see what temperature our customers prefer.<p class=message>Good idea. I don't want to melt while I'm kneading dough.<p class="message sent">Yeah, nobody wants a pool of melted bakers in the middle of the bakery. Let's get started on that bread making.<p class=message>Agreed! Let's bake and make some delicious concoctions!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ec3bc800-2baa-4a72-8835-81b027470d0a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
