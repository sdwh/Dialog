How's it going with the database maintenance?<p class="message sent">Pretty good, A. Just finishing up some routine checks. What brings you over here?<p class=message>I actually discovered a vulnerability during the penetration testing. I wanted to discuss it with you.<p class="message sent">Oh, well, we're always trying to improve our security here. What did you find?<p class=message>It turns out that the password for the admin user was too weak. It was "password123".<p class="message sent">(laughs) Oh no, I thought we got rid of all those weak passwords. Thanks for catching that.<p class=message>No problem. I even wrote some suggestions for a stronger password.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll take a look at them. Did you find anything else?<p class=message>Yeah, I also noticed that some database tables had unnecessary privileges. I think we could tighten them up a bit.<p class="message sent">Sounds like another great catch. I'll make sure to look into that.<p class=message>And one last thing. The database server was running an outdated software patch. We should update that ASAP.<p class="message sent">(sighs) Yeah, I knew that one was coming. We'll get right on it.<p class=message>Hey, don't worry. It's better to find these things before any real damage can be done.<p class="message sent">(smiling) You're right, A. Thanks for being on top of our security. We make a pretty good team.<p class=message>Agreed! Maybe we should come up with a cool team name, like "The Cyber Defenders" or something.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I like it! We'll have to get some matching t-shirts.<p class=message>(chuckles) You know it. But seriously, let's keep up the good work and keep this database safe.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We'll show those hackers who's boss.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f2133769-5231-4760-ad73-2b212fa9e085.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
