How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, thanks! What about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. Hey, I was looking at the results of the penetration testing and noticed a few critical vulnerabilities. Did you have a chance to take a look?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I remember seeing those. What did you think of them?<p class=message>Well, we definitely need to address them ASAP. I was thinking of preparing a report outlining the details and recommendations for remediation. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan to me. Anything specific you had in mind?<p class=message>For one thing, we need to make sure that all input fields are properly validated to prevent SQL injection attacks. And we should also review the access controls to tight them up where necessary.<p class="message sent">Good points. I also remember that we had a weak password policy in place. That's something we should address as well.<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's get on top of this and knock out those vulnerabilities. We can't afford to leave these things unaddressed.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's always better to be proactive than reactive when it comes to security.<p class=message>That's right. So, I'll get started on that report and we can work together to get everything patched up. Thanks for your help, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help out. Let's make sure we get this done right.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=96070b9b-3b66-490a-b4c9-6b37029a4492.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
