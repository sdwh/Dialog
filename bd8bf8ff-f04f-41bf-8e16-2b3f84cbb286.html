I'm a reporter from the Daily News. Mind if I ask you a few questions?<p class="message sent">Not at all, go ahead!<p class=message>Great, so what brings you to this event today?<p class="message sent">Well, I heard there was going to be free food and drinks, so I couldn't resist!<p class=message>(laughs) I hear you, I'm a big fan of freebies too. But seriously, what do you think about the event overall?<p class="message sent">Actually, it's quite impressive. There are so many interesting exhibits and activities to take part in. I could spend the whole day here!<p class=message>That's awesome to hear! What's your favorite exhibit so far?<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough question. But I'd have to say the virtual reality experience. It's so immersive and realistic!<p class=message>I tried that too and I totally agree. It's like you're really there in the game. So, do you think events like this are important for the community?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's a great way to bring people together and showcase some of the latest technologies and developments. Plus, it's just plain fun!<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. By the way, do you mind if I snap a quick photo of you for our paper?<p class="message sent">Go ahead, but let me just fix my hair first.<p class=message>No problem, I'll wait. And while you do that, can you tell me one last thing? If you could invent any technology, what would it be and why?<p class="message sent">Hmm, well I've always wished there was a way to instantly clean your house without lifting a finger. So maybe a robot that could do all the cleaning for you?<p class=message>(laughs) I think a lot of people would love that invention too. Thanks for sharing that with me, and for the great interview!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bd8b1d1d-c8bd-41d8-b44f-b24dc1eef0c5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
