How are you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I'm doing pretty well, thanks! How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great! So, tell me, how has your English learning experience been so far?<p class="message sent">It's been good, but I feel like I could use some improvement in my speaking skills.<p class=message>That's understandable. Have you tried practicing with a language partner?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have, but it's hard to find someone who has the same schedule as me.<p class=message>I see. Well, have you tried practicing on your own or listening to English podcasts?<p class="message sent">No, not really. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Sure, there are some great language learning apps you can try, like Duolingo or Babbel. And for podcasts, I recommend "Stuff You Should Know" and "TED Talks Daily."<p class="message sent">Thanks for the suggestions, I'll definitely check them out!<p class=message>No problem. One more thing, have you tried setting goals for yourself?<p class="message sent">Like what kind of goals?<p class=message>Well, you can set short-term goals, like practicing vocabulary every day, and long-term goals, like taking the TOEFL or TOEIC exam.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. That makes sense.<p class=message>It's important to have a plan and stick to it. Learning a language is a process, so don't get discouraged if it takes longer than you thought.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the encouragement, A! I'll try my best and see how it goes.<p class=message>That's the spirit! Remember, practice makes perfect, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.<p class="message sent">I'll keep that in mind. Thanks again, A!<p class=message>My pleasure, B. Let's touch base next week to see how your progress is going.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, see you then!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aa10c9f1-28ce-454b-af27-2cf40f92a478.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
