Can't complain! How about yours?<p class="message received message-content">Same here! I was thinking, have you started thinking about how we're going to test the new e-commerce site we're working on?<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, I've been thinking about it. I was thinking of starting with some manual testing to get a feel for the site before we automate anything.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds like a good plan. I was thinking we could also try using some automation tools, like Selenium or Cypress.<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, those tools are great for streamlining our testing process. But we shouldn't rely on them too heavily. It's important to manually test features as well to catch any edge cases that the automation might miss.<p class="message received message-content">That's a good point. We should also create some test cases with different scenarios to make sure the site is working correctly.<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely. And we should try to come up with some creative scenarios that could happen in the real world, like a customer checking out with a coupon code or adding an item to their cart while logged in as a guest.<p class="message received message-content">Agreed. It's always better to be thorough with our testing so we can catch any potential bugs before the site goes live.<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely. And we should also make sure we're communicating any issues we find to the rest of the team so they can be addressed in a timely manner.<p class="message received message-content">Good idea. We'll also want to keep a record of any bugs we find and the steps to reproduce them so we can fix them efficiently.<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, that will definitely help us stay organized during the testing process. It's looking like we have a solid plan for testing this new e-commerce site!<p class="message received message-content">Definitely. And hey, now that our work talk is out of the way, do you have any fun plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent message-content">Actually, I was thinking of trying that new sushi place that just opened up. Want to join me?<p class="message received message-content">Sounds great! I'm always up for trying new sushi spots. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0af44267-dd60-4c00-a2a9-31521d521f24.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
