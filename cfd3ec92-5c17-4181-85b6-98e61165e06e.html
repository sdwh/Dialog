I think we have a deck of cards somewhere around here.<p class="message sent">Great, let's get started! By the way, have you ever played poker before, Nurse A?<p class=message>Yes, I have. We used to play it at home with my family during the holidays.<p class="message sent">Ah, that's fantastic! I think we're in for a great game then.<p class=message>Definitely! But before we start, let me check your blood pressure and make sure you're healthy enough to play.<p class="message sent">Of course, do what you need to do. I appreciate the care you give me.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, Mr. B. Alright, your blood pressure looks good, and you're good to go.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Nurse A! Let's shuffle these cards and start dealing them out.<p class=message>Okay, let's do it!
