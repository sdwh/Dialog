Welcome aboard! Are you excited for your trip?<p class=message>Yes, we are! We've heard great things about the beaches there. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes. Several times, actually. It's a beautiful place. There are so many things to do and see.<p class=message>That's great to hear! What do you recommend we should do while we're there?<p class="message sent">Well, you could try surfing or visit the theme parks. There are also some great restaurants and bars along the beach.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Do you have a favorite restaurant or dish that we should try?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I can't recommend just one. There are so many great places to eat at. Just try some of the local seafood â€“ it's delicious!<p class=message>That's a great tip, thank you! Do you have any funny stories from your previous trips to Gold Coast?<p class="message sent">Actually, I remember taking a couple to a restaurant, and they accidentally left their car keys in my taxi. We had to go back to the restaurant to retrieve them.<p class=message>(laughs) Oh wow, that's quite a coincidence! Do you have any tips for us to have a smooth and trouble-free vacation?<p class="message sent">Just remember to stay hydrated and put on sunscreen. And don't forget to bring a map or GPS, unless you want to rely on me to drive you everywhere!<p class=message>Haha, we'll make sure to be prepared. Thank you for your advice and for being our driver!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Enjoy your trip to Australia Gold Coast!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2ce27082-f204-45ec-a870-77217c5e5632.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
