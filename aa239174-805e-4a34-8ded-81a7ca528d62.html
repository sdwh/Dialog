How's business going in the restaurant?<p class="message sent">Oh, I can't complain. Things are going pretty well. We're getting a lot of customers for our seafood dishes.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Have you tried getting your seafood from some local fishermen here at the beach?<p class="message sent">Actually, I haven't thought of that. Do you know any of them?<p class=message>Yes, I'm one of them! I catch all sorts of fish and shellfish right here in this part of the sea. You can be sure they're fresh from the water.<p class="message sent">That's perfect! I’m always looking for fresh seafood to serve in the restaurant. What kind of fish do you have today?<p class=message>Well, I caught some salmon and tuna earlier this morning. I also have some crabs and oysters too.<p class="message sent">Hmm, those all sound great. How about we make a deal? I'll buy your fresh seafood, and you can have your meals here in the restaurant for free!<p class=message>Sounds like a plan to me! Just come down to the shore tomorrow morning, and I'll have your fresh seafood ready for you.<p class="message sent">Excellent! I’m looking forward to it. I'll make sure to make some special dishes and add them to our menu.<p class=message>That's awesome! I can't wait to try them. By the way, do you have any recommendations for the best way to cook the crabs?<p class="message sent">Hmm, my favorite way is to steam them with some lemon juice and garlic butter. It's simple and really brings out the natural taste.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! Thanks for the tip. I'll try that myself at home sometime.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always great to share cooking tips with fellow food enthusiasts.<p class=message>Absolutely! Well, I better get going and check on my fishing nets. I'll see you tomorrow, B.<p class="message sent">See you, A! Thanks for the freshest seafood supply for our restaurant.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aa200186-e685-43b2-81fa-b3c8bfe9794d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
