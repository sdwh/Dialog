Thank goodness we made it in time for the press briefing.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's intense. I hope we can get some good shots for the article.<p class=message>Definitely. So, what's your plan for the photo coverage?<p class="message sent">Well, I'll start by taking some wide-angle shots of the overall scene. Then, I'll focus on details, such as the markings on the road and any relevant signage.<p class=message>Great idea. I'll be interviewing the authorities and witnesses. I hope I can find someone who can provide some insight into what happened.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Hey, check out that protester waving his sign around. That would make for a good photo.<p class=message>I see him. Let's get a closer look. Hey buddy, would you mind posing for a picture?<p class="message sent">Perfect, hold that pose. That shot's going to be iconic.<p class=message>You know what, we've been working hard. Let's take a coffee break.<p class="message sent">Good idea. I could use a pick-me-up.<p class=message>Sorry, but there's only decaf. Health and safety regulations.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Ah well, I guess I'll just have to pretend.<p class=message>Hey, look over there. There's a group of kids playing ball. Let's join in.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. It'll be a nice break from all the seriousness.<p class=message>(throws ball) Heads up! (laughs)<p class="message sent">(catches ball) Nice one! Let's do this again sometime.<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's get back to work now. We have a deadline to meet.<p class="message sent">Agreed.
