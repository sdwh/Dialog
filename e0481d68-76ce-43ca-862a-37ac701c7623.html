So, let's start with the interview.<p class=message>Sure, so B, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?<p class="message sent">Of course. Well, I'm a musician and I've been performing for about 10 years now. I play the guitar and sing.<p class=message>That's awesome! Do you have any upcoming gigs?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do have a show next week. You should come and check it out.<p class=message>I definitely will! So, what inspired you to become a musician?<p class="message sent">I actually started playing guitar when I was a teenager, and it just became my passion. I love how music can bring people together and create a mood.<p class=message>I totally agree with you. Speaking of moods, what type of music do you usually play?<p class="message sent">I play mostly indie and folk music, but I also like experimenting with different genres.<p class=message>That's interesting. So, what's the biggest challenge you've faced as a musician?<p class="message sent">I think the biggest challenge for me is staying true to myself and my music, while still trying to appeal to a wider audience.<p class=message>That can be tough. Well, thank you for taking the time to talk with us today, B.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, it was fun!
