How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>Not too bad, thanks for asking. I'm a fisherman around these parts. I was wondering if we could have a chat about seafood procurement?<p class="message sent">Of course! I'm always interested in talking about seafood. What kind of fish do you specialize in catching?<p class=message>I typically catch salmon, trout, and halibut. But lately, I've come across some really big lobsters too. What do you have on your menu that could feature these different types of seafood?<p class="message sent">We have some amazing seafood dishes on our menu. We offer grilled salmon with a lemon butter sauce, fish and chips made with fresh halibut, and baked lobster with a garlic butter sauce. We also have some Lobster mac and cheese and Lobster rolls.<p class=message>Wow, those sound amazing! How do you acquire the seafood that goes on your menu?<p class="message sent">We partner with local fishermen and fishermen's markets to ensure that we get fresh and high-quality seafood. We also have suppliers who bring us exotic seafood from other parts of the world.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I think it's important to have fresh seafood for great dishes. What is your most popular seafood dish?<p class="message sent">Our most popular dish would have to be our seafood platter, which includes a bit of everything - fish, shrimp, scallops, and calamari. It's a fan-favorite for those who can't decide on just one dish.<p class=message>That sounds appetizing! I'll have to give that a try the next time I visit. It's remarkable to see such a variety on your menu. I'll keep it in mind for customers too.<p class="message sent">Thank you! We try to keep the menu fresh and exciting for our customers. If you ever come across any unique seafood, be sure to let me know, and we can add it to the menu.<p class=message>Sure thing! Thanks for your time and expertise. I feel confident about the quality of your seafood after our conversation.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. We strive to offer the best seafood in the area, and we value the input of local fisherman's like you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=996e95c2-b6dd-4946-b79d-8d5d1e68af8c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
