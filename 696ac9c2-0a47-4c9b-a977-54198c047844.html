Found quite a few issues that need to be addressed.<p class=message>Oh really? Which ones specifically caught your attention?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, I noticed some code duplication in the authentication module.<p class=message>Ah, that's not good. Any other major issues?<p class="message sent">Yes, the input validation in the payment gateway module needs to be improved.<p class=message>Hmm, that's definitely something we should tackle. Any suggestions on how to fix these issues?<p class="message sent">We could try implementing a design pattern to avoid the code duplication, and add more robust input validation checks to the payment gateway module.<p class=message>Great idea, we'll take that approach. Have you already started working on these fixes?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've already created a branch to work on these issues.<p class=message>Perfect, let's make sure to test rigorously before we merge any changes.<p class="message sent">Definitely, we don't want to introduce any new bugs.<p class=message>By the way, have you seen that meme about programmers and their love for coffee?<p class="message sent">Haha, no, I haven't. What's it about?<p class=message>It's a picture of someone frustrated with their code, and the caption says "why won't this work?! I've had three cups of coffee already!"<p class="message sent">(laughs) Oh, that's relatable. I go through at least two cups a day!<p class=message>Same here! But I'm also guilty of snacking too much while coding.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, coding can be stressful, but snacks make everything better.<p class=message>Agreed. Speaking of snacks, want to grab some lunch after this?<p class="message sent">I'm down. Let's take a break from coding and recharge.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6964c03d-ff8e-431f-8e1e-2f58d2bbf6ac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
