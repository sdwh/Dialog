How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm a new student here and I'm curious about the enrollment process. Can you tell me more about it?<p class=message>Of course! The enrollment process starts with submitting an application form online. Once we receive it, we will contact you to schedule an interview.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. What kind of questions will be asked during the interview?<p class=message>We will ask you about your educational background, your goals, and why you're interested in studying here. It's also an opportunity for you to ask us any questions you may have.<p class="message sent">I see. Is there anything else I need to prepare before the interview?<p class=message>Just be yourself and bring along any necessary documents, such as your academic transcripts or resume.<p class="message sent">Okay, thanks for the advice. How many students do you usually accept each year?<p class=message>We don't have a fixed number, but we do have a limited number of spaces available each year.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. How do you promote the school to potential students?<p class=message>We participate in education fairs and events, we advertise online and on social media, and we also rely on word of mouth from our satisfied students and alumni.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a comprehensive marketing strategy. I'm looking forward to joining this school.<p class=message>Great to hear! We're excited to have you as a student. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns about the enrollment process.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f15eebff-086c-4f15-8ea8-1f606649e1ea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
