Did you have a good time learning how to make Okinawan dishes and drinks?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it was amazing! I can't wait to try these recipes back at our restaurant.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. What was the most interesting drink you learned to make?<p class="message sent">Definitely the awamori. It's so unique and has a distinct flavor.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard of awamori before. It's a popular drink in Okinawa, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. It's made from rice and has a high alcohol content.<p class=message>Sounds strong! Did you try any of the local Okinawan dishes?<p class="message sent">Yes, I tried a few. Goya champuru was my favorite. It's a stir-fry dish with bitter melon, tofu, and pork.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! We should definitely add that to our menu.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And we could pair it with the awamori for a true Okinawan dining experience.<p class=message>Speaking of our menu, I'm sure our customers will love the new additions.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And it's exciting to be able to offer something unique and different.<p class=message>Absolutely. Plus, it's a great opportunity to share Okinawan culture with our customers.<p class="message sent">That's right. There's so much more to Okinawa than just beautiful scenery and beaches.<p class=message>It's always great to learn and experience new things. Thank you for bringing back these amazing recipes, B.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. Can't wait to see how our customers enjoy them!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fe394b65-f631-4e5a-9844-2dcf9b4ee7e8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
