I'm really excited to be travelling to Istanbul. Have you been there before, B?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's a great city with so many things to see and do. Do you have anything specific in mind?<p class=message>Well, I definitely want to see the Blue Mosque and the Grand Bazaar. Oh, and I hear the food is amazing too!<p class="message sent">You're right about that! Have you tried any Turkish food before?<p class=message>Not really, but I've heard of kebabs and baklava. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class="message sent">How about trying some Turkish tea? They serve it everywhere and it's really good. And don't forget to try the Turkish delight!<p class=message>Oh, I love tea! And I'm definitely looking forward to trying Turkish delight. Is there anything else I should know before we go?<p class="message sent">Well, be prepared for some bargaining at the bazaar. It's part of the experience and you can get some great deals!<p class=message>Good to know. I'll make sure to brush up on my bargaining skills. Do you have any favourite spots in Istanbul, B?<p class="message sent">I really enjoy walking along the Bosphorus and taking in the views. And there are some great rooftop bars with amazing views of the city.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. I'm really excited for this trip. Thank you for the recommendations, B!<p class="message sent">No problem.
