What is it about?<p class=message>It's a set of guidelines for managing and preventing social engineering attacks.<p class="message sent">Social engineering? Is that like a fancy term for manipulation?<p class=message>Yeah, it's when someone gains access to confidential information by tricking people into revealing it.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. So how do these guidelines work?<p class=message>They outline strategies for detecting and preventing social engineering attacks, such as increasing employee awareness and implementing stricter access controls.<p class="message sent">Sounds useful. But do you think everyone at our company would take it seriously?<p class=message>Maybe not everyone, but it's important to educate them on the risks and consequences of social engineering attacks.<p class="message sent">True. So have you seen any success with this approach?<p class=message>Yeah, I've heard of companies reducing their risk of social engineering attacks by up to 50%.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. Maybe we should suggest this to our boss.<p class=message>Definitely. It's better to be safe than sorry, right?<p class="message sent">Agreed. Thanks for bringing this to my attention, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to share information that helps keep us secure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5b3f07d3-2daf-465f-ad0b-be6c189c11eb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
