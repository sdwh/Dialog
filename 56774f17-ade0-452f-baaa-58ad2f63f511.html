How long do you think the ride will take?<p class="message sent">It depends on traffic, but it usually takes around 2-3 hours.<p class=message>Oh, that's not too bad. Do you have any good recommendations for things to see or do while we're there?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out the Confucius Temple and the Qin Huai River. They're both quite lovely places to visit.<p class=message>Sounds great! Have you ever had any strange experiences while driving?<p class="message sent">Well, one time a passenger fell asleep and started snoring really loudly, I didn't know what to do!<p class=message>Haha, at least it's better than a passenger who talks non-stop.<p class="message sent">That's true! But I'm always happy to chat with interesting passengers like you.<p class=message>Aw, thanks! So what's the most interesting place you've ever driven to?<p class="message sent">I once drove a group of tourists to the Great Wall of China. It was a bit of a long drive, but it was well worth it.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. I've always wanted to go there.<p class="message sent">You should definitely go, it's incredible.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation, and for being such a friendly driver.<p class="message sent">No problem, it's always a pleasure meeting interesting people like you.
