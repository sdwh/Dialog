How about you?<p class=message>Just playing some games on my new phone. Speaking of which, any new games in development?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we just finished designing a new puzzle game. Want to try it out?<p class=message>Sure, I love puzzles. What's the objective?<p class="message sent">Basically, you have to solve increasingly complex puzzles by manipulating tiles on the board.<p class=message>That sounds like a challenge. What's it called?<p class="message sent">It's called "Tile-Twist".<p class=message>Sounds intriguing. When can I get my hands on it?<p class="message sent">We're still in the testing phase, but hopefully it'll be released in a few months.<p class=message>Can't wait. Speaking of games, have you ever played any of the classics like Pac-Man or Space Invaders?<p class="message sent">Of course! Those games were classics for a reason.<p class=message>I've been thinking about creating a retro-style game, what do you think?<p class="message sent">Remembering the good old days, huh? I think it's a great idea.<p class=message>What about adding some modern twists to it?<p class="message sent">That could work. Maybe some new power-ups or obstacles to spice things up.<p class=message>Awesome, let's make it happen. By the way, have you heard any good jokes lately?<p class="message sent">Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything.<p class=message>(laughs) That's a good one. How about this: What did the grape say when it got stepped on? It let out a little whine.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Classic. Thanks for the laugh!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=67e028ed-f472-4762-a737-cd666bff409c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
