How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Not great, to be honest. I've never been to a police station before.<p class=message>Well, we're not here to harm you. We just want to ask you a few questions about the incident last night.<p class="message sent">What incident?<p class=message>The one where you were caught stealing a garden gnome from Mrs. Johnson's front yard.<p class="message sent">Oh, that. Look, I didn't mean to take it. I was just drunk and thought it would be funny.<p class=message>I understand that alcohol can cloud judgment, but taking someone's property is never a joke. Can you tell me why you thought it was amusing?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I don't even remember thinking that. It was just a stupid decision I made in the moment.<p class=message>I see. Do you have anything else to add about the situation?<p class="message sent">Not really. I'm sorry for what I did, and I promise it won't happen again.<p class=message>Alright then. We'll let you go with a warning this time, but please think twice before doing something like this again.<p class="message sent">Thank you, officer. I appreciate it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=82735867-dd35-411e-865a-2fb81d92990b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
