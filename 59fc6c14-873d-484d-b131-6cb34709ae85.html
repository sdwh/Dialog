B, can you start us off with your progress report?<p class="message sent">Sure, I've been working on implementing a new feature for the app. It has been challenging but I am making good progress.<p class=message>Great news. And what about the team's blocker, has anyone encountered any issues that need addressing?<p class="message sent">Well, there was a brief moment when our server went down, but we were able to quickly resolve it thanks to our talented DevOps engineer.<p class=message>Thank you for bringing this up. I'll be sure to give a shoutout to them. On a lighter note, has anybody watched anything interesting lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, I just finished watching a horror movie over the weekend. It was so scary, I couldn't even sleep properly that night!<p class=message>Oh no! I'm not a horror fan at all. I prefer documentaries or comedies.<p class="message sent">I love comedies too! Have you watched any good comedy shows recently?<p class=message>Yes, I've been really enjoying "Brooklyn Nine-Nine". The characters are hilarious and I love the lighthearted nature of the show.<p class="message sent">That's such a great show, I've seen it too! Maybe we can have a Netflix party this weekend and watch some episodes together?<p class=message>That sounds like a fun idea! Let's organize it. Okay, everyone, let's wrap up the meeting. Keep up the good work, and have a great day!<p class="message sent">Bye guys, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=59f891d3-41e6-4a33-9300-0345762bc5c3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
