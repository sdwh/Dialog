How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hi, doctor. I'm feeling a bit under the weather today. I think I caught a cold.<p class=message>I see. Let's check your temperature and see if there are any other symptoms.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Can I ask you a question first though?<p class=message>Of course, what's on your mind?<p class="message sent">Do you have any tips for staying healthy during the cold and flu season?<p class=message>Well, staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest can help boost your immune system, but also try to avoid touching your face and wash your hands frequently.<p class="message sent">Thanks, doctor. That's really helpful.<p class=message>Alright, let's take your temperature. Hmm, it looks like you have a mild fever.<p class="message sent">Oh no, does that mean I need to take antibiotics?<p class=message>Not necessarily. If it's just a cold, antibiotics won't be effective. But I'll prescribe you some medication to help relieve your symptoms.<p class="message sent">Okay, thank you. By the way, have you had any interesting cases lately?<p class=message>Actually, I had a patient who had hiccups for an entire week! It turned out to be caused by stress.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's crazy. I hope they were able to find some relief.<p class=message>Yes, we were able to work on reducing their stress levels and the hiccups eventually stopped.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Thank you for your help today, doctor.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Get some rest and stay hydrated. Take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ecdaf050-ef23-4ada-a825-ab93a5086910.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
