Shall we bring our frisbee?<p class=message>Absolutely! Do you think you can beat me this time?<p class="message sent">Oh, we'll see about that! But first, let's enjoy the beautiful scenery.<p class=message>Ah, look at those ducks over there. Have you ever seen such beautiful feathers before?<p class="message sent">No, they're so colorful! And oh, there's a lonesome squirrel!<p class=message>Speaking of lonely, how are you doing in school? Are you making any new friends?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have a new friend and he’s always making jokes in class.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Laughter is always the best medicine.<p class="message sent">You're right dad. But sometimes his jokes are not funny.<p class=message>Haha, well everyone has their own sense of humor. Maybe you can share some of your jokes with him as well.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'll give it a try. Oh, look at that beautiful butterfly!<p class=message>Yes, the orange and black colors are striking! Did you know that monarch butterflies are known for their long migration journeys?<p class="message sent">Really? That's amazing! Dad, what other interesting facts do you know?<p class=message>Well, did you know that a group of crows is called a murder?<p class="message sent">Wow, I had no idea! That's so cool.<p class=message>Yes, it is. And did you also know that laughter is said to boost the immune system?<p class="message sent">No way! Maybe that's why you never get sick because you’re always cracking jokes!<p class=message>Haha, I wish my jokes were that good! But this walk with you is certainly lifting my spirits. How about yours?<p class="message sent">Definitely dad. Spending time with you always makes me feel better.<p class=message>That’s all I can ask for, son. Shall we continue our walk?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And this time, I'll really try to beat you at frisbee.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ea183405-df8f-46c2-9334-ad8d45f589dd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
