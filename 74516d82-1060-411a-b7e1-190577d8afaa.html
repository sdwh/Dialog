How do you think the future of fishing is going to look like?"<p class="message sent">"Well, I think it's going to be more technology-driven. We're already seeing drones and underwater robots being used, and I bet there's more to come."<p class=message>"That's true. But I also think we need to focus more on sustainability. We can't keep catching fish at the rate we are now, or else we'll run out."<p class="message sent">"Right, that's a good point. Maybe we should start looking into farm-raising fish instead of only relying on wild ones."<p class=message>"That could be a good solution. But it might take time for people to get used to it. Some people are still hesitant about eating farm-raised fish."<p class="message sent">"Yeah, I see your point. But we can also educate them on the benefits and how it can help conserve our fish population."<p class=message>"True. And I think another trend we'll see is more focus on niche markets. People are willing to pay more for sustainably caught fish and exotic varieties."<p class="message sent">"That's a possibility. It could also mean smaller boats and crews, but a higher price per pound."<p class=message>"Exactly. And who knows, maybe there will be new species discovered in the future that we can target."<p class="message sent">"Ha! That would be amazing. Imagine catching a new type of fish and being the first to bring it to market."<p class=message>"Almost sounds like a dream come true, doesn't it?"<p class="message sent">"It does indeed. But overall, I think the future of fishing will require us to adapt and be creative."<p class=message>"Agreed. Change can be difficult, but I think we have the skills and knowledge to make it work."</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=74515efd-e272-4ddd-852c-aa13edebab1c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
