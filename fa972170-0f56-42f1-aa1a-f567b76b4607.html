How about you?<p class=message>Not too bad, just trying to keep up with the demand for the sandwiches.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, those are always a popular item here. What kind of sandwiches are you making?<p class=message>We have a variety of options, including ham and cheese, turkey and avocado, and roast beef and cheddar.<p class="message sent">Yum, those all sound delicious. Are they made fresh daily?<p class=message>Yes, we make them early in the morning and they're ready to go by the time the store opens.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. Do you also make any other food items?<p class=message>Yes, we also make salads, wraps, and sushi.<p class="message sent">Sushi? That's unexpected for a supermarket.<p class=message>Yes, we recently added it to our menu and it's been a hit. It's a great option for customers looking for something healthy and light.<p class="message sent">I'll have to give it a try next time I'm on my lunch break. Speaking of breaks, do you get to try any of the food you make?<p class=message>Yes, we have a tasting station where we can sample our products to make sure they meet our standards.<p class="message sent">That sounds fun! I bet you get to try some really tasty things.<p class=message>Definitely! It's also a great way for our team to give feedback and make any necessary improvements.<p class="message sent">Well, keep up the good work. I'm sure your tasty sandwiches are making a lot of customers happy.<p class=message>Thanks, it's nice to hear positive feedback. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You too!
