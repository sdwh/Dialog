Could you take me to Guangzhou city, please?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, sir! It's a pleasure to be your driver today.<p class=message>Thank you! How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been doing this for over 20 years. I've seen so many changes in the city, it's incredible.<p class=message>Really? What's the most interesting thing you've seen during your time as a driver?<p class="message sent">One time, a couple got in my taxi and they were speaking a language I couldn't understand. Turns out they were speaking Parseltongue, like in the Harry Potter movies. It was a weird ride, but definitely memorable.<p class=message>That's crazy! I'm such a big Harry Potter fan. Have you read the books?<p class="message sent">Not really, sir. I'm more of a movie guy. But I can appreciate a good story, though!<p class=message>I get it. What's your favorite movie, then?<p class="message sent">Oh, without a doubt, it's Back to the Future. Marty McFly and Doc Brown are the best!<p class=message>That's a classic for sure. I love that movie too. Do you like to travel, Mr. Taxi Driver?<p class="message sent">I can't say I do, sir. I feel like my work takes me all over the city as is it is. But my wife likes to travel, so I go with her sometimes.<p class=message>Well, it's always good to have a change of scenery, right? I love to travel. My favorite place I've been to so far is Japan. How about you?<p class="message sent">I've never been there, sir. But I hear the people are very polite and the food is fantastic!<p class=message>Yes, you're right! The food is amazing. Speaking of food, do you have any recommendations of must-try foods in Guangzhou?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! You have to try the dim sum in Guangzhou. It's world-renowned.<p class=message>I love dim sum! What's the best place to go for that?<p class="message sent">There's a place called Dim Sum Garden that's really good. They have a huge variety and it's always busy.<p class=message>Sounds perfect! I'll have to give it a try. Thank you so much for the recommendation and for the pleasant conversation on this ride.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, sir. Have a great time in Guangzhou!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4972cf16-4e06-47d2-a6d6-c7ae5a66dbd7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
