Make sure to keep an eye on it while it's on the grill.<p class="message sent">Got it! And how about the katsuobushi? Any tips for preparing that?<p class=message>For the best flavor, I recommend using freshly shaved bonito flakes. It'll make all the difference.<p class="message sent">Okay, thanks for the advice. I'll keep that in mind.<p class=message>Speaking of fish, have you tried grilling any yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have!
