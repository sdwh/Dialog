How about you?<p class=message>Of course! Who doesn't? What's your favorite seafood dish?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough one...I'd have to say garlic butter shrimp.<p class=message>Yes! Shrimp is definitely one of my favorites too. Have you tried raw oysters?<p class="message sent">I have, and they're not bad. But I prefer them cooked, maybe grilled.<p class=message>Grilled oysters are delicious! Have you ever tasted crab cakes?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I had them at a restaurant last month. They were so good. How do you like your salmon cooked?<p class=message>I like it grilled, with some lemon and herbs. What's your go-to fish for fish tacos?<p class="message sent">I usually use tilapia or cod, but sometimes I'll splurge on some lobster meat. How about you?<p class=message>I like to mix it up, but mahi-mahi is a favorite of mine for fish tacos.<p class="message sent">Speaking of mixing it up, have you ever had sushi with avocado and mango?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Sounds interesting though! What's your favorite type of sushi?<p class="message sent">Definitely salmon sushi. But I also like eel sushi, especially when it's served warm.<p class=message>Eel sushi is delicious! Have you ever tried a seafood boil?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's messy, but totally worth it. Do you prefer clams or mussels?<p class=message>I like both, but I think I prefer clams. What about you?<p class="message sent">I'm the opposite, I prefer mussels. Hey, do you like octopus?<p class=message>I do, but I think it depends on how it's cooked. Have you tried calamari?<p class="message sent">Yes, and I love it! I could eat it all day. What's your favorite way to eat squid?<p class=message>I like it grilled or fried, with some lemon and garlic. Hey, we should plan a seafood feast soon!<p class="message sent">I'm down for that!
