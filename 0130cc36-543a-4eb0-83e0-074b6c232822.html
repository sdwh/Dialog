How about you?<p class="message received message-content">Of course! Who doesn't? What's your favorite seafood dish?<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, that's a tough one...I'd have to say garlic butter shrimp.<p class="message received message-content">Yes! Shrimp is definitely one of my favorites too. Have you tried raw oysters?<p class="message sent message-content">I have, and they're not bad. But I prefer them cooked, maybe grilled.<p class="message received message-content">Grilled oysters are delicious! Have you ever tasted crab cakes?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh yeah, I had them at a restaurant last month. They were so good. How do you like your salmon cooked?<p class="message received message-content">I like it grilled, with some lemon and herbs. What's your go-to fish for fish tacos?<p class="message sent message-content">I usually use tilapia or cod, but sometimes I'll splurge on some lobster meat. How about you?<p class="message received message-content">I like to mix it up, but mahi-mahi is a favorite of mine for fish tacos.<p class="message sent message-content">Speaking of mixing it up, have you ever had sushi with avocado and mango?<p class="message received message-content">No, I haven't. Sounds interesting though! What's your favorite type of sushi?<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely salmon sushi. But I also like eel sushi, especially when it's served warm.<p class="message received message-content">Eel sushi is delicious! Have you ever tried a seafood boil?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I have. It's messy, but totally worth it. Do you prefer clams or mussels?<p class="message received message-content">I like both, but I think I prefer clams. What about you?<p class="message sent message-content">I'm the opposite, I prefer mussels. Hey, do you like octopus?<p class="message received message-content">I do, but I think it depends on how it's cooked. Have you tried calamari?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, and I love it! I could eat it all day. What's your favorite way to eat squid?<p class="message received message-content">I like it grilled or fried, with some lemon and garlic. Hey, we should plan a seafood feast soon!<p class="message sent message-content">I'm down for that!
