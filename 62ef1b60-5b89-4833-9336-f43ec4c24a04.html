What can I help you with today?<p class="message sent">Hello, I'm a tour guide and I brought some visitors here to learn more about the local wine. We'd like to taste some and learn more about the process.<p class=message>Wonderful. Have you had any experience with wine tasting before?<p class="message sent">Some of us have, but others are new to it.<p class=message>That's great. I'll start by pouring you a glass of our Tempranillo. It's a red wine that's grown extensively in this region.<p class="message sent">Thank you. What makes Tempranillo special here?<p class=message>Well, the combination of the soil, sun exposure and climate here produces unique and flavorful grapes. This translates to a wine that's smooth, slightly spicy and with notes of vanilla and cherries.<p class="message sent">That sounds delightful. How often do you harvest the grapes?<p class=message>We harvest them once a year, in September or October. It's a very busy time for us.<p class="message sent">I can imagine! How long do you let the wine age before it's bottled?<p class=message>We age it for at least 6 months to a year, depending on the type of wine. We want to make sure it has enough depth and complexity before it gets bottled.<p class="message sent">Fascinating. Can you tell us more about the winemaking process?<p class=message>Sure. It starts with the grapes being harvested and sorted, then they're crushed and de-stemmed. Then we let the juice ferment with the skins for a period of time before we age and bottle it.<p class="message sent">This is really interesting. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us. Can we try another wine?<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's try our Chardonnay. It's a white wine that's refreshing and has hints of apples and pears.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a perfect match for our tapas later. Thanks for having us here today. We're really enjoying learning about how wines are made in this region.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=62e90cdd-bc31-4408-ba52-fc0dc6a760d6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
