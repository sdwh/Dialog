I just finished setting up the database for the system.<p class=message>Great! I'll work on the front-end and let you know if I need any data from the database.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. By the way, have you seen the latest cat video on YouTube?<p class=message>No, I haven't. I've been too busy coding. Is it worth a watch?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's hilarious. I can send you the link.<p class=message>Thanks, I'll make sure to watch it during my next break.<p class="message sent">Speaking of breaks, have you tried the new caf√© down the street yet? They have amazing coffee.<p class=message>No, I haven't. I usually bring my own coffee from home. But I'm open to trying new places. Is it expensive?<p class="message sent">Not at all. And the barista is super friendly.<p class=message>Alright, I'll check it out. Maybe we can grab a coffee there together during our next break.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Oh, and I almost forgot to ask, did you receive the email from HR about the upcoming team building event?<p class=message>Yes, I did. I'm looking forward to it. Do you have any ideas for team building activities?<p class="message sent">Not yet. But I heard they hired a professional event planner, so I'm sure they have some great ideas in mind.<p class=message>That's reassuring. I hope it's not too intense though. I'm not very athletic.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'm sure there will be something for everyone. And if all else fails, we can always bond over our love for cat videos and coffee.<p class=message>Haha, sounds perfect to me. Let's crush this system development so we can afford to take longer coffee breaks.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a92b3309-bef5-436a-8f8b-1d41e8fc82ff.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
