What's it taste like?<p class=message>Well, the combination of flavors is actually quite delicious. The savory pie and the slightly sweet soup surprisingly complement each other well!<p class="message sent">Hmm, still not sure if I'm up for trying it. Is it a popular dish over there?<p class=message>Absolutely! It's a staple in South Australia, where it originated. You can find it at most food festivals and even some cafes.<p class="message sent">Maybe I'll have to make a trip to Australia just to try it then!<p class=message>Oh, you definitely should. There are also different variations of pie floaters, like adding vinegar or tomato sauce on top.<p class="message sent">Wow, the possibilities are endless with this dish! Do you have a favorite way to eat it?<p class=message>I like to add a dollop of chili sauce on top for an extra kick. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm a traditionalist, so just the pea soup and meat pie for me.<p class=message>Fair enough! It's definitely worth a try if you ever get the chance though.<p class="message sent">I'll keep that in mind. Speaking of food, have you tried any other unique dishes during your travels?<p class=message>Oh yes, I've had some interesting meals in my time. Have you ever heard of haggis from Scotland?<p class="message sent">Uh oh, that doesn't sound appetizing at all...</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=62e23eb0-9162-4218-9f52-5b81424b298f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
