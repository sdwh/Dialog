Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.<p class="message sent">Of course, always happy to talk to the press.<p class=message>So, we hear that you recently implemented a new policy for the city. Can you tell us about it?<p class="message sent">Yes, we've decided to ban plastic bags in all stores, in an effort to reduce waste and protect the environment.<p class=message>That's certainly a bold move. What kind of response have you been getting from the public?<p class="message sent">Actually, it's been surprisingly positive. We've received a lot of support from environmentally conscious citizens who are happy to see us taking action.<p class=message>Well, that's great to hear. But I have to ask, how are people going to carry their groceries now?<p class="message sent">Ah, that's a good question. We're encouraging everyone to use reusable bags or to bring their own bags from home.<p class=message>I see. Do you have any other plans in the works to promote sustainability in the city?<p class="message sent">Yes, we're looking into adding more bike lanes and promoting public transportation as well. We want to make it easier and more convenient for people to make eco-friendly choices.<p class=message>Sounds like you're on the right track. Speaking of transportation, have you ever ridden a bike to work?<p class="message sent">Haha, I can't say I have, but I do try to walk or take the subway whenever I can.<p class=message>Well, maybe one of these days you'll give biking a try. Thank you so much for speaking with us today, Mr. B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, it was my pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=311994a1-ff6b-4beb-9bf1-6f7a99c3bdec.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
