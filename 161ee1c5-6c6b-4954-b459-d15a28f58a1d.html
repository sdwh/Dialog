My name is Sarah and I'll be your guide today.<p class="message sent">Hi Sarah, thanks for having me. I've always wanted to visit the Sydney Opera House.<p class=message>Every year, the Opera House attracts about 10.9 million visitors to its various activities and shows. That's about one-third of the population of Australia!<p class="message sent">That's amazing. I can see why though, it's such a beautiful building. Can you tell me a little bit about its history?<p class=message>Sure. The idea for the Opera House came about in the 1940s as a competition to design a national opera house. The winning design was from Danish architect Jorn Utzon.<p class="message sent">That's really interesting. And why is the Opera House such a significant landmark for Sydney?<p class=message>Well, it's an internationally recognized symbol of Australia, and its unique design has made it a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's also one of the busiest performing arts centers in the world.<p class="message sent">Wow, I had no idea. Can we take a look inside?<p class=message>Of course! The interiors are just as impressive as the exteriors. You can see the main hall, which is designed to resemble the interior of a whale.<p class="message sent">That's so cool! What other activities can we do here?<p class=message>There are guided tours, live performances, and even behind-the-scenes tours where you can see how the performers prepare for shows.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely have to come back again and see a show. This place is incredible.<p class=message>We'd love to have you back. And remember, the best way to end your tour is with a panoramic view of the harbor from one of our restaurants.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tip, Sarah. I'll be sure to do that. This has been a great tour. Thank you so much for all your knowledge!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1613dfef-044c-4090-990c-d43679a41517.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
