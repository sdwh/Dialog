What about you?<p class=message>I'm very excited to be going to Miami. Have you ever been there?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've been there several times. It's a beautiful place with great beaches and nightlife.<p class=message>That's why I'm going there. I want to experience the sun, sand, and party scene.<p class="message sent">You're definitely going to have a blast. Just make sure to stay safe and enjoy responsibly.<p class=message>I promise to do just that. Do you have any tips for me while I'm there?<p class="message sent">Well, if you want some good Cuban food, you should definitely try out Versailles Restaurant. And if you want to do some shopping, there are a lot of great malls, but I recommend Aventura Mall.<p class=message>Sounds like great recommendations. Thanks! Do you have any favorite Miami music?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm a fan of Pitbull and Gloria Estefan. Their music always gets me in the Miami spirit.<p class=message>I love Pitbull! We're going to have to listen to his music while we're there.<p class="message sent">Definitely! We can even listen to it on the way to the airport now.<p class=message>Speaking of which, how long do you think it will take to get to the airport?<p class="message sent">It should take about 45 minutes, but with traffic, you never really know.<p class=message>That's true. I'm just crossing my fingers for no delays or cancellations.<p class="message sent">Hopefully everything goes smoothly. But if there are any issues, I'll make sure to help you out.<p class=message>Thanks, you're a great taxi driver. I'm glad we got to chat and get to know each other a little better.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's always nice to connect with people and hear their stories. Have a great trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f1b4c192-1a5d-4cf6-947d-135da564d46f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
