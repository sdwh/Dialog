We have a fantastic collection of artifacts from ancient Egypt that I'm sure you'll love. They have such a rich and fascinating history.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. What kind of artifacts do you have?<p class="message sent">We have everything from sarcophagi to papyrus scrolls. You can even see an authentic mummy if you'd like.<p class=message>I've always been fascinated by mummies. How old is the mummy on display?<p class="message sent">The mummy is about 2000 years old! It's incredibly well-preserved and you can even see some of the hieroglyphics on the wrappings.<p class=message>That's incredible. What else can I see in this section?<p class="message sent">In addition to the mummy, we have a replica of King Tut's tomb and a variety of ancient Egyptian art and jewelry.<p class=message>I'm definitely going to check out King Tut's tomb.

I'll give you a map of the museum and suggest some must-see exhibitions based on your interests.<p class=message>Great, thank you so much!
