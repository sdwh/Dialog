I've been coding away like a busy bee.<p class=message>I can imagine. So, what kind of information do you think we should include in the website?<p class="message sent">Well, we could include information on marine life, such as their habitats, diets, and behaviors.<p class=message>That's a great idea. We could also add details on water pollution and the impact it has on aquatic life.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's a significant issue that needs to be addressed. We could provide tips on how people can help reduce pollution in the ocean.<p class=message>Speaking of tips, we should also gather information on eco-friendly activities people can do around the beach.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We could add sections for beach cleanups, sustainable tourism, and other activities that promote environmental conservation.<p class=message>That would make our website very informative and useful for ocean-lovers. By the way, did you know that dolphins are excellent problem-solvers?<p class="message sent">Really? I had no idea. They're not only cute, but also smart!<p class=message>Yeah, they sure are. By the way, have you ever tried scuba-diving?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But it's on my bucket list of things to do.<p class=message>You should give it a try. It's an incredible experience to be submerged in the ocean with all its beauty.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely consider it. Who knows, I might even get some inspiration for new features for our website!<p class=message>That would be great! Speaking of new features, do you have any other ideas for the website?<p class="message sent">Well, we could include a section on ocean-related news to keep people updated on recent events and discoveries.<p class=message>Excellent idea. Overall, we have a lot of work to do, but it's going to be a fun and exciting journey.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Let's make the most informative and user-friendly oceanic ecology database website ever!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=89b2fd18-edb0-43d7-b417-1854dbe4b3d3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
