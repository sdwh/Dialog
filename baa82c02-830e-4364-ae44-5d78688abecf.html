It's been a pretty busy day so far, but it's always nice to have a new passenger to talk to. How about you, how's your day going?<p class=message>It's been a bit hectic, I had to rush to catch my flight this morning, but I'm looking forward to a fun weekend in Marseille.<p class="message sent">Ah, Marseille, it's a beautiful city. Have you been there before?<p class=message>No, it's my first time. Any recommendations on what to see or do while I'm here?<p class="message sent">Well, of course you have to go see the Vieux Port and the Notre-Dame de la Garde, they're the most famous landmarks. But if you're looking for something more unique, I recommend the MuCEM museum, it's really fascinating.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation, I'll definitely check it out. By the way, what kind of music do you like to listen to?<p class="message sent">I like all kinds of music, really. But lately I've been into some old school funk and disco, it really gets me in a good mood.<p class=message>That's awesome, do you have any particular favorite artists or songs?<p class="message sent">One of my favorites is Kool & The Gang, I love listening to their classic hits like "Celebration" and "Jungle Boogie."<p class=message>I love those songs too, they're so catchy. Do you ever sing along to them when you're driving?<p class="message sent">Ha, sometimes I do if I'm feeling especially cheerful. But I try to keep my passengers' ears safe from my singing voice.<p class=message>I bet you have a great voice though. Anyway, we're almost at my hotel now, thanks for the lovely chat and the tips on what to see in Marseille.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, I hope you have a wonderful time here. And if you need a ride anywhere else, don't hesitate to give me a call.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=baa6caf1-1b17-4d0a-9602-491651fd5704.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
