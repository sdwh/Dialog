What's up with it?"<p class=message>"They added a new dark mode theme. It's pretty cool-looking."<p class="message sent">"Dark mode always makes everything look cooler. Can't wait to get my hands on it."<p class=message>"Yeah, and it's supposed to be easier on the eyes too. No more strain from staring at a screen all day."<p class="message sent">"Definitely a plus. Hey, have you had a chance to try out that new library we were talking about last week?"<p class=message>"Yeah, I integrated it into our code yesterday. It made everything so much smoother."<p class="message sent">"That's awesome! It's amazing how a small change can make such a big difference to our development process."<p class=message>"Speaking of changes, have you seen that meme going around on Twitter about coding?"<p class="message sent">"No, what's it about?"<p class=message>"It's funny, it shows someone coding in one window and in the other, their reflection is coding too. The caption is something like 'When you're so good, even your reflection codes.'"<p class="message sent">"Haha, that's great. I've definitely had days where I felt like I was coding in my dreams too."<p class=message>"I know, right? It's like we become one with the code. But it's a good thing we have each other to bounce ideas off, and have a laugh or two."<p class="message sent">"Agreed. We make a good team, A."<p class=message>"Same to you, B. Alright, let's get back to work, lots to do before the deadline."<p class="message sent">"Yeah, let's do this!
