How about you?<p class=message>Same here, always busy in the office. Hey, have you heard of that new restaurant that just opened up downtown?<p class="message sent">Oh, which one are you talking about?<p class=message>It's called "The Hungry Piglet". I heard they have the best pulled pork in town.<p class="message sent">Mmm, sounds delicious. We should go try it out for lunch this week.<p class=message>I'm down for that. Hey, did you see the latest episode of that TV show we were talking about last week?<p class="message sent">No, I missed it. How was it?<p class=message>It was so funny! You have to catch up on it. They even had a guest appearance from a famous actor.<p class="message sent">Really? Who was it?<p class=message>I can't spoil it for you, you'll have to watch it to find out.<p class="message sent">Alright, alright, I'll make sure to watch it soon. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class=message>No problem. By the way, have you noticed that funny picture on Dave's desk?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, the one with his dog wearing a bow tie? That always makes me laugh.<p class=message>Me too. Speaking of pets, did you know that the office down the hall has a resident cat?<p class="message sent">What?! How have I never heard of this before?<p class=message>I know, right? Apparently it's a part of their "stress relief program".<p class="message sent">That's genius. Maybe we should suggest that to our boss.<p class=message>Ha, good luck with that. I'm not sure if they would go for it.<p class="message sent">Well, it's worth a shot. In the meantime, let's go plan that lunch at The Hungry Piglet.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b669ad88-5ff5-4bd5-8a88-f1393b1b1079.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
