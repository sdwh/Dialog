I'm the manager and I'll be serving you today.<p class="message sent">Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to trying some authentic Japanese cuisine.<p class=message>Absolutely! Our menu is filled with traditional dishes that have been enjoyed for centuries. Have you experienced tea ceremony before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I actually practice tea ceremony back at home. I’m very excited to see the difference between the Westernized version and the traditional one in Japan.<p class=message>That's wonderful! Kyoto is the perfect place to experience the authentic tea ceremony, and we offer it here as well.<p class="message sent">Great! I'd love to try it out.<p class=message>Our tea ceremony master will be with you shortly. In the meantime, would you like to try some of our seasonal specialties?<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds perfect. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Our tempura is very popular during this time of year. Also, our sukiyaki is made with fresh beef and vegetables.<p class="message sent">Oh, both sound so good. Could we maybe start with the tempura and then have sukiyaki as our main dish?<p class=message>Of course! I’ll put that order in for you right away.<p class="message sent">Thank you! By the way, do you have any recommendations for good places to visit in Kyoto?<p class=message>There are so many great places to visit in Kyoto! I recommend visiting Kinkakuji Temple or Nijo Castle.<p class="message sent">I have been to Kinkakuji before, but I haven't visited Nijo Castle yet. Thank you for the recommendation!<p class=message>You're welcome! Kyoto is a beautiful city filled with history and culture.<p class="message sent">Speaking of culture, I can see the tea ceremony master walking towards us.<p class=message>Enjoy your tea ceremony experience!
