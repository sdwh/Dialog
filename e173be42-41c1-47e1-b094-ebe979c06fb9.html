My name is Alex and I will be your server tonight. May I start you off with something to drink?<p class="message sent">Hi Alex, thank you. I'll have a glass of red wine, please.<p class=message>Absolutely. Can I recommend our Cabernet Sauvignon? It pairs wonderfully with our steaks.<p class="message sent">Sounds great. I'll go for that.<p class=message>Excellent choice. Are you visiting New Orleans for the first time?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. It's a beautiful city with so much culture and history.<p class=message>It sure is. Have you tried any of our famous dishes like gumbo or jambalaya?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard so much about them. Can you recommend one?<p class=message>If you like seafood, I highly recommend the seafood gumbo. It's a local favorite and packed with flavor.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. I'll give it a try.<p class=message>Great choice. And for your entree, may I recommend our filet mignon? It's our most popular dish, and for good reason.<p class="message sent">You don't have to convince me, I'm sold on it already!<p class=message>Haha, I'm glad to hear that. And would you like anything else with your steak, like mashed potatoes or roasted vegetables?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely the mashed potatoes. Can't go wrong with a classic steak and potatoes combo.<p class=message>You sure can't. And just to let you know, our portions are quite generous, so you might want to consider sharing a dessert.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a good idea. What's your favorite dessert on the menu?<p class=message>Personally, I'm a fan of the Bananas Foster. It's a classic New Orleans dish with bananas flambeed in rum and cinnamon, served with vanilla ice cream.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. Let's give it a try then.<p class=message>Perfect. I'll put everything in right away. If you need anything else, just let me know.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Alex. You've been a great help. We're looking forward to our meal.<p class=message>My pleasure, I'm always happy to assist. Enjoy your dinner!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e16f4c15-ec71-436b-89a1-1ed732877295.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
