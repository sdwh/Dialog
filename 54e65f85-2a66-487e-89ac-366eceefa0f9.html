What's your game plan for patching them up?<p class="message sent">Well, I think I'm gonna start with the low-hanging fruit and work my way up from there.<p class=message>That's a good approach. Did you see anything particularly interesting in the results?<p class="message sent">Yeah, actually. We've got a few instances where user-input isn't being sanitized properly.<p class=message>Ah, classic mistake. Good catch. Definitely wanna fix that up before someone exploits it.<p class="message sent">You got it. Hopefully, we can close that door before they even find it.<p class=message>That's the idea. Anything else catch your eye?<p class="message sent">Not really, it's mostly just a bunch of minor issues that can be addressed with some minor modifications.<p class=message>Well, that's not too bad. Keep up the good work, and I'm sure we'll have this all sorted out in no time.<p class="message sent">Will do. It's always a good feeling to know we're keeping our users and data safe.<p class=message>Absolutely. Speaking of which, wanna grab some lunch and celebrate our collective vigilance?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Let's go grab some grub!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=54e47262-2caa-44b4-9719-12536ecb38f6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
