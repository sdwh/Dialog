I'm the network security engineer. Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm the system administrator. Great to meet you too!<p class=message>So, building a secure enterprise network is our goal. Where do we start?<p class="message sent">Well, we can start by defining the network infrastructure we need.<p class=message>That's true. We need to know what kind of devices we will use, how they will be connected, and what security protocols we will implement.<p class="message sent">Right. A solid firewall is essential, and we need to make sure our network is encrypted.<p class=message>Yes, and we also need to implement access controls to make sure only authorized users can access the network.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We should also monitor the network for any unusual activity and have a disaster recovery plan in place.<p class=message>Agreed. And we should remember that the weakest link in any security system is usually the users themselves. We need to make sure to educate them on safe computing practices.<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely. We can't forget about the human element. It's essential that everyone plays their part in maintaining a safe network.<p class=message>Well, it looks like we have our work cut out for us, but I'm confident we can make this happen.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's no easy task, but with our combined expertise and dedication, we can create a secure and reliable enterprise network that everyone can rely on.<p class=message>Great! Let's get started then. I can't wait to see what we can accomplish together.<p class="message sent">Me too. Let's make it happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d6bcff49-6de4-41cc-a729-70e3a2cd71bb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
