It seems like we have a few findings that need to be addressed.<p class=message>I'm glad you agree. Which ones do you think are the most critical?<p class="message sent">Well, I think we should prioritize the ones related to security and performance.<p class=message>That makes sense. Have you thought about how we can go about fixing them?<p class="message sent">I've been doing some research and it seems like there are some tools we can use to automate the process. Have you heard of any?<p class=message>Yeah, I've heard of a few. I think we should try out a few different ones to see what works best for our specific codebase.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'll start looking into some options to see what we can try out.<p class=message>Sounds good. How long do you think it'll take us to fix everything?<p class="message sent">It's hard to say for sure, but I think if we both dedicate a few hours each day, we can get everything taken care of within a week or so.<p class=message>That's a reasonable estimate. Let's get started and try to knock out as many of these findings as possible.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It'll be satisfying to have a clean codebase once we're done with this.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Plus, it'll make future development much easier and less error-prone.<p class="message sent">That's the hope! But for now, let's focus on fixing what we can and making our current code as secure and efficient as possible.<p class=message>You got it. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6a3ace15-5c68-427b-9f83-9d6dd95ff735.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
