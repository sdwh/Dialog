Are you ready for our music lesson today?<p class="message sent">Good morning A! Yes, I am really excited for today's lesson.<p class=message>Great! So, what do you want to focus on today? Do you have a specific piece you want to learn?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was hoping to work on my sight-reading skills. I always struggle with that.<p class=message>Sure, we can definitely do that. Let's start with something simple and gradually increase the difficulty as we go.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. By the way, have you heard the new song that's been making the rounds on the internet?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class="message sent">It's called "Baby Shark". It's been stuck in my head all week!<p class=message>(laughs) Oh, I think I know that one. It's definitely catchy! Maybe we can play it for fun after our lesson?<p class="message sent">Yes, that would be awesome! So, can you give me some tips on how to improve my sight-reading skills?<p class=message>Of course! First, try to take small sections and practice them repeatedly until you get comfortable with them. Then, move on to the next section.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. How do you train your own sight-reading skills?<p class=message>I like to challenge myself by playing different genres of music that I'm not familiar with. It keeps things interesting and helps me improve my overall skills.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I'll definitely try that. Thanks for the tip.<p class=message>No problem! I'm looking forward to seeing your progress. Alright, let's get started with some sight-reading exercises.<p class="message sent">Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2eb47f9c-c83d-4c6d-b942-bf6baeb3683f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
