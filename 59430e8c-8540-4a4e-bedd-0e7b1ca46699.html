You're doing great.<p class=message>Thanks, I couldn't do it without you. This place is absolutely incredible.<p class="message sent">I know, right? I love guiding people on this route. It's got some of the most breathtaking views in Tasmania.<p class=message>Yeah, and the wildlife! Did you see that wallaby hopping around earlier?<p class="message sent">Oh, absolutely! Although, I'm more partial to the echidnas myself.<p class=message>Echidnas? How have I not seen them?<p class="message sent">Keep your eyes peeled, they're pretty shy. But trust me, they're worth it.<p class=message>Speaking of wildlife, do we have to worry about any dangerous animals around here?<p class="message sent">Not too much actually, just make sure to keep an eye out for snakes. They're around, but theyâ€™ll generally keep to themselves unless provoked.<p class=message>Got it. I'll keep my hiking boots firmly laced then.<p class="message sent">Hahaha, good idea. But seriously, if you have any concerns or see anything that worries you. Let me know.<p class=message>I appreciate that. So, what's the plan for when we get to the summit?<p class="message sent">We'll take a little break to catch our breaths and have some snacks, then we'll start heading back down.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I'm already dreading the hike back down, but at least it's all downhill, right?<p class="message sent">Hahaha, it is indeed. Not to mention, the view will be different on the way back, so it'll be like a whole new hike.<p class=message>You're right, I hadn't even thought of that. I'm just looking forward to reaching the end of the hike and kicking my feet up.<p class="message sent">Well, let's make that happen then. Almost to the top now.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=593e864b-dff6-4854-9597-2ca439c68845.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
