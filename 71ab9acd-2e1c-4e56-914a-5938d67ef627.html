How was your weekend, B?<p class="message sent">Hi, teacher! My weekend was great, thanks for asking. How about yours?<p class=message>It was quite relaxing. I spent most of my time binge-watching a show on Netflix. Have you watched anything interesting lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I watched the new Marvel movie and it was amazing! I’m a huge fan of superheroes.<p class=message>Oh, that’s fantastic! Who’s your favorite superhero?<p class="message sent">My favorite is definitely Spiderman. I admire his agility and quick reflexes.<p class=message>Yes, Spiderman is definitely a favorite among fans. Did you know that the first Spiderman comic was published in 1962?<p class="message sent">Really? That’s before my parents were even born!<p class=message>Yes, it’s been around for quite a while. Now, let’s focus on today’s lesson, shall we? We’ll be discussing sentence structure and punctuation.<p class="message sent">Sounds good! I know that proper sentence structure is important for clearer communication.<p class=message>Yes, it is. For instance, the sentence “Let’s eat, grandpa” can be confusing without proper punctuation.<p class="message sent">That’s true. If not properly punctuated, it can be interpreted as “Let's eat grandpa." That’s not what we want to say!<p class=message>Absolutely right, B! Now, let’s practice some sentences together. How about you start?<p class="message sent">Okay. “Although I love pizza, I shouldn’t eat it every day.”<p class=message>Excellent! That was a perfectly formed sentence. I’m glad to see you’re paying attention to the lesson.<p class="message sent">Thank you, teacher! I really enjoy learning English with your class.<p class=message>It’s my pleasure, B. And don’t forget: practice makes perfect. Keep up the good work, everyone!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=71a377c0-8e6e-4595-9a25-898b659effb3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
