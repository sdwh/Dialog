I'm sorry to hear that. Let me have a look.<p class=message>Thank you so much. I didn't want to make a fuss, but it tastes a bit weird.<p class="message sent">No worries. We always want our customers to enjoy their meals. Can you please tell me which dish you ordered?<p class=message>I had the seafood pasta. It's my favorite, but this time it tastes a little off.<p class="message sent">I get it. I'll check with the kitchen and get you a fresh one.<p class=message>Thank you so much!<p class="message sent">Our apologies again. Was everything else okay with your meal?<p class=message>Everything else was great. I especially loved the garlic bread.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that! Our garlic bread is definitely one of our specialties.<p class=message>I have to say, though, that I'm impressed with how you handled my complaint. You were so polite and professional.<p class="message sent">Thank you very much. We take our customers' satisfaction seriously, and I’m glad I could help in this manner.<p class=message>I can see that, and that's definitely appreciated.
