My name is Officer Johnson. I understand that you were brought in for questioning?<p class="message sent">Yes, officer. But I'm innocent. I didn't do anything wrong.<p class=message>That's what they all say, sir. Can you tell me where you were on the night of the robbery?<p class="message sent">I was at home, officer. Watching TV and eating pizza.<p class=message>Do you have anyone who can verify that?<p class="message sent">Only my pet cat, officer. But he's not very talkative.<p class=message>Well, we'll have to check your alibi. Can you describe the suspect that you saw that night?<p class="message sent">I didn't see anyone, officer. Like I said, I was at home.<p class=message>Hmm. Any reason why your fingerprints were found at the crime scene?<p class="message sent">What? That's impossible. I've never been to that place.<p class=message>We'll have to test those fingerprints, sir. In the meantime, would you like some coffee?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. Do you have any donuts too?<p class=message>Sorry, sir. We don't have any donuts at the moment.<p class="message sent">Ah, that's too bad. Donuts would've made this place more bearable.<p class=message>Let's get back to the case, sir. Are you willing to take a lie detector test?<p class="message sent">Yes, officer. I have nothing to hide.<p class=message>Alright, we'll schedule that soon. In the meantime, can you tell me what kind of pizza you were eating that night?<p class="message sent">It was pepperoni and mushroom, officer. Delicious.<p class=message>Sounds good. Well, we'll be in touch, sir. Thank you for your cooperation.<p class="message sent">No problem, officer. Don't forget to bring some donuts next time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=358e13f4-5686-47ea-9506-ce5ea86892c9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
