I've been looking forward to this for weeks.<p class=message>That's great to hear. First things first, let's go over the hand signals we'll be using underwater.<p class="message sent">Okay, I think I got it. Thumbs up means everything is good, and thumbs down means we need to surface, right?<p class=message>Exactly. And if I make a circle with my finger, it means to stay in one place and look around.<p class="message sent">Got it. How deep are we going?<p class=message>Not too deep for your first dive. We'll start at around 10 meters and work our way down if you're feeling comfortable.<p class="message sent">Perfect. I was a bit nervous about the depth.<p class=message>No worries, B. Remember to breathe slowly and evenly. Let's take a deep breath and descend.<p class="message sent">Wow, this is amazing! The colors and wildlife are so beautiful.<p class=message>*thumbs up* I'm glad you're enjoying it. What do you see over there?<p class="message sent">Oh, there's a school of fish over there! And is that a sea turtle?<p class=message>It sure is! We're lucky to see one up close. Keep an eye on your oxygen level, B. We don't want to stay down too long.<p class="message sent">*thumbs up* Okay, I checked my gauge and I'm good.<p class=message>Great job, B! Let's start making our way back up to the surface. Remember to keep breathing and use slow, controlled movements.<p class="message sent">This has been such an unforgettable experience. Thank you for being a great instructor and showing me the ropes!<p class=message>You're welcome, B. It was my pleasure to explore the Great Barrier Reef with you. Don't forget to get your scuba certification so we can go on more adventures in the future!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=095f30ce-0d20-4a9e-a4ce-3ca06a33810e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
