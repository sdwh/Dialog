It's been a long process.<p class=message>Yeah, definitely. But at least we get to add some humor in the report, right?<p class="message sent">(chuckles) Oh, you mean the section on employee password habits?<p class=message>Yes, exactly! We can mention that some employees seem to think their password is secret if they write it on a sticky note and put it under their keyboard.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's always a good one. And we can't forget the classic "password1234" that we found used more than once.<p class=message>(smirks) Yeah, we need to shake things up a bit. Maybe we can suggest some alternative, more secure passwords, like "iloveunicornsandpizza".<p class="message sent">(laughs) Perfect. And what about the section on physical security? We can mention the time we found someone's office door locked with a sticky note that said "be back in 15 minutes".<p class=message>(laughs) Yes, and the time we found a visitor badge lying on the ground outside the building.<p class="message sent">(nods) And then there was the time we found a server room unlocked with the key still in the lock.<p class=message>(groans) Don't remind me. Let's add some recommendations about proper key management and access control for that one.<p class="message sent">(smiles) Agreed. And maybe we can also include a section on social engineering, like the time we pretended to be a cleaning crew to gain access to a restricted area.<p class=message>(laughs) I remember that. We definitely need to stress the importance of employee awareness training in that section.<p class="message sent">(nods) Definitely. Alright, let's get back to work on this report. I think we've got some great content to work with.<p class=message>(smiles) Yep, it's going to be a fun one to write.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=24563373-88d8-479b-8d55-d07d213a84ec.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
