Have you been thinking about how we can streamline our testing and deployment processes?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's been on my mind for a while now. I think we should focus on automation.<p class=message>That's music to my ears! In my opinion, the less manual labor required, the better.<p class="message sent">For sure. With automation, we can catch bugs before they cause any real damage.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. What tools do you suggest we use for testing?<p class="message sent">Well, I've been playing around with Selenium and it seems pretty solid.<p class=message>Nice! I've heard good things about that one. How about deployment?<p class="message sent">We can use Jenkins to automate our deployment process. It's super user-friendly.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. So, how do we want to approach creating these tests?<p class="message sent">We could start by creating a list of test cases that are critical to our application.<p class=message>Excellent idea. Then we can prioritize and tackle them one by one.<p class="message sent">Exactly! And as we build out each test case, we can automate it using Selenium.<p class=message>I like where this is going. Do you have experience with Jenkins?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've used it in the past. It's pretty straightforward to set up and use.<p class=message>Great news! We can schedule our deployments for after hours so that we don't cause any disruptions during office hours.<p class="message sent">That's a smart move. We don't want to impact anyone's work.<p class=message>Precisely. With these tools in place, we can be more efficient and productive.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And we can spend less time on testing and more time on developing cool new features.<p class=message>You're speaking my language! Now let's get cracking on putting our new automated testing and deployment process into action.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9f9cb6e5-524f-4c48-b3e2-48f7b134e8f0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
