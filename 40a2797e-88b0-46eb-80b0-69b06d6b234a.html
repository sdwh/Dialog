Just trying to stay in shape for the upcoming season.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What kind of training have you been doing lately?<p class="message sent">Mostly cardio and strength training. I'm trying to build up my endurance for the longer matches.<p class=message>I see. Well, have you thought about incorporating some plyometric exercises into your routine? It could help with explosive movements on the court.<p class="message sent">Really? I've never tried that before. Do you have any suggestions?<p class=message>Sure, how about box jumps or jump squats? They can really work your lower body muscles.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll give it a shot. But what about upper body strength? I feel like I need to work on that too.<p class=message>For sure. Push-ups, pull-ups, and bench presses are all great exercises for building upper body strength. And don't forget to stretch before and after every workout.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I always forget about stretching. Thanks for the reminder.<p class=message>No problem. And remember, consistency is key. Make sure you're training regularly and staying focused on your goals.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks for the advice, coach.<p class=message>Anytime, keep up the good work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=40a117cf-0adc-4c3f-932b-b38ea355a112.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
