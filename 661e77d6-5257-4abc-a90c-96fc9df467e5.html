What can I do?<p class=message>You might be able to file a complaint with your local government. Alternatively, you could talk to your neighbor and try to resolve the matter amicably.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that’s helpful. But what if my neighbor refuses to cooperate?<p class=message>If that happens, you may need to take legal action. However, I would suggest trying to work things out first.<p class="message sent">Alright, I’ll give talking to my neighbor a shot. Thanks for your help!<p class=message>You’re welcome. So, what’s new with you? Have you done anything exciting lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, I went on a cruise recently. It was amazing!<p class=message>Sounds like heaven! What was your favorite part of the trip?<p class="message sent">Definitely the food. I had lobster every day!<p class=message>That’s the life! I wish I could have lobster every day.<p class="message sent">Haha, wouldn’t we all? But seriously, thanks for your help today.<p class=message>Of course!
