I'm the food quality control specialist here. May I ask what you're up to?<p class="message sent">Hey! I'm a Korean kimchi maker. I'm just here to make sure our kimchi is up to par for the international market.<p class=message>That's great! Speaking of kimchi, have you tried any of the local kimchi here?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I did. They're delicious. But I want to make sure our kimchi is on a whole new level.<p class=message>You know what, we also have some special types of kimchi here. Like radish kimchi, green onion kimchi, and even cucumber kimchi! Have you tried any of those?<p class="message sent">No way! I've never heard of cucumber kimchi. I definitely have to try that!<p class=message>It's really good, and it's perfect for the summer. Speaking of summer, are you planning to go to any beaches here?<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm not sure. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>You should definitely try the beaches in Jeju Island. They have crystal-clear waters and white sand beaches.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing! I'll definitely add it to my bucket list.<p class=message>Hey, do you have any other Korean dishes you'd like to try while you're here?<p class="message sent">Well, I heard that there's a dish called "gimbap" that's similar to sushi. Have you tried it?<p class=message>Oh yes, gimbap is really popular here. It's basically rice rolls with seaweed, vegetables, and meat inside. I love it!<p class="message sent">That sounds so good. I can't wait to try it!<p class=message>Speaking of food, can I ask you something? What makes good kimchi?<p class="message sent">Ah, that's a great question. The key to making good kimchi is using fresh ingredients and proper fermentation. It should have a perfect balance of sourness, saltiness, and spiciness.<p class=message>I see. That's really interesting! I'll keep that in mind when I do our quality control checks.<p class="message sent">Great! You can count on me to make sure our kimchi is always up to par.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. It's been really nice talking to you!<p class="message sent">Same here! Thanks for the recommendations, and I can't wait to try some of those kimchi variations!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3498e847-a72b-4705-8f21-3bf7294b0316.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
