Good to see you again in this meeting room. What's the latest on the market trend analysis?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! Glad to be here. Well, the market trend seems to be moving towards sustainable and eco-friendly products. People are becoming more conscious about the environment.<p class=message>That's interesting. Do you think our company should shift towards that path too?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We should consider offering eco-friendly alternatives to our current products or even introduce new sustainable products. It will attract more customers and positively impact the environment.<p class=message>Okay, that makes sense. Do you have any data to support this trend?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. According to a recent study, the demand for sustainable products has increased by 70% in the last two years alone.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. We definitely need to take advantage of this opportunity. But, how about the production cost of these eco-friendly products?<p class="message sent">It may cost more initially, but in the long run, it will benefit both the company and the environment. We can also communicate the added value to customers.<p class=message>Good point. So, what are the next steps we should take to implement this strategy?<p class="message sent">First, we should conduct a feasibility study and present it to the management. Then, we can start the market testing and launch the product if it proves successful.<p class=message>I agree. Let's collaborate and make this happen. Thanks for your insights, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. It's always a pleasure working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=320a743f-888d-495f-876b-e8ad05cebd25.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
