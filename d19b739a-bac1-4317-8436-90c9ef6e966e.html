But I'm also worried about the security aspect of it. What do you think?<p class=message>Well, Kubernetes has a strong security feature. It isolates each application in a container, so even if one application is compromised, it won't affect the others.<p class="message sent">That's a relief to hear. But what about the cost? Wouldn't it be expensive to use Kubernetes?<p class=message>Not necessarily. There are free and open-source versions available too. Plus, it's more cost-effective in the long run as it automates a lot of tasks, saving time and money.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's good to know. Automation is always a plus.<p class=message>Yup, and speaking of automation, have you heard of serverless computing?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. It's where the cloud provider manages the servers, right?<p class=message>Exactly. It's a great way to reduce costs and improve scalability. The provider only charges you when your code is running.<p class="message sent">Nice, I like the sound of that. But what about the learning curve for our team?<p class=message>That's a valid concern. But serverless platforms like AWS Lambda make it easy to get started. You don't have to manage and provision servers - just upload your code and let Lambda handle the rest.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's cool! This could be a game changer for us.<p class=message>Yeah, I think so too. It's always exciting to explore new technologies and see how they can benefit the bank.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And we'll have to plan some time to train the team on these new tools.<p class=message>For sure. But first, let's grab a cup of coffee and celebrate our new deployment strategy.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d1999925-4dbd-4097-be29-28b3a71316a9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
