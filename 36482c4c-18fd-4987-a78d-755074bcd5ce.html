How about you?<p class=message>I'm excited to be traveling to Hokkaido. I've heard a lot about the place.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's one of the most beautiful places in Japan. Have you been there before?<p class=message>No, this is my first visit. What's your favorite thing about Hokkaido?<p class="message sent">It's hard to pick just one thing, but I love the skiing and snowboarding. The powder there is amazing.<p class=message>Sounds like a lot of fun! I'm not much of a snow sports person, to be honest.<p class="message sent">No worries, there are plenty of other things to do. The food in Hokkaido is also amazing.<p class=message>Oh really, I hadn't heard that. What kind of food do they have there?<p class="message sent">The seafood is great, especially the salmon and crab. And the dairy products are pretty famous too, like the ice cream and cheese.<p class=message>Ah, that sounds delicious! I'll definitely have to try some.<p class="message sent">It's definitely worth it! Have you planned out your itinerary?<p class=message>Not really, I just wanted to soak up the atmosphere and have a good time. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">You should check out the Sapporo Snow Festival, it's a really cool event that happens every February.<p class=message>That sounds awesome! I'll make sure to mark my calendar.<p class="message sent">Great, and don't forget to visit the hot springs too. They're a great way to relax after a long day of sightseeing.<p class=message>Absolutely, that's definitely on my list. Thanks for the suggestions, and thanks for the ride!<p class="message sent">No problem, have a great time in Hokkaido!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=36470eed-89a4-4edc-ae60-66964df58132.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
