Mind if I join you at this table?<p class="message sent">Not at all, please do! It's always nice to have some company at a buffet.<p class=message>Definitely agree. So have you tried any of the dishes here? Any recommendation?<p class="message sent">Yes, I highly recommend the sushi - it's really fresh and tasty. Also, the roast beef is a must-try!<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestions. Oh, and by the way, where are you from?<p class="message sent">I'm from Australia, how about you?<p class=message>I'm from Canada. I'm actually quite surprised we're able to have this conversation so smoothly. Your English is excellent!<p class="message sent">Thank you, I appreciate it. Yours is great as well, I wouldn't have been able to tell that English isn't your first language.<p class=message>Haha, thanks. I've been learning English for many years, but speaking with native speakers still makes me a bit nervous.<p class="message sent">Don't worry about it, just remember to have fun with it! Hey, have you traveled to any other countries before?<p class=message>Yes, I've been to Japan and Thailand before. How about you?<p class="message sent">I've traveled to a few countries in Europe, but Japan and Thailand are also on my bucket list.<p class=message>Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Japan especially has some amazing food experiences.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely keep that in mind. So what are your plans for the rest of the day?<p class=message>I have a few tourist attractions and landmarks planned out. How about you?<p class="message sent">I plan on exploring some of the local markets and checking out some local street art. Maybe we'll run into each other again?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Let's exchange numbers and keep in touch. It was nice chatting with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise, enjoy your travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=821c89a5-e52b-4124-8a6c-2830d10347a5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
