Can't believe you're already 25!<p class="message sent">Thank you, Dad! Time flies so fast, don't you think?<p class=message>Absolutely, it feels like you were just born yesterday. So, what would you like to order?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'll go with the steak.<p class=message>Good choice, but don't get too full! We have a surprise for you later.<p class="message sent">A surprise? I'm intrigued!<p class=message>(whispers) We got you a new car!<p class="message sent">(shocked) Are you serious?! That's amazing!<p class=message>Yes, we thought it's about time you upgrade from that old clunker of yours.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Hey, that old clunker has sentimental value to me!<p class=message>I know, I know. But this new car is even cooler, trust me.<p class="message sent">(smiling) I can't wait to see it! Thank you both so much.<p class=message>You're welcome, dear. So, how's work been lately?<p class="message sent">It's been busy, but good. We're launching a new product next month, so it's been a lot of work but also exciting.<p class=message>That's awesome. I'm proud of you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Dad. I'm excited to see where this takes me.<p class=message>Speaking of work, I heard that your colleague, John, got a promotion.<p class="message sent">(nodding) Yes, he did. He deserves it. He's been working hard for it.<p class=message>You better watch out, he might become your boss soon.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Let's not jinx it, Dad. But even if he does, I'm sure we'll still get along fine.<p class=message>Well, as long as he doesn't start bossing you around too much.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I'll make sure to put him in his place if he tries to.<p class=message>(laughs) That's my girl. Alright, let's eat and celebrate your birthday!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=14000908-7376-4d5e-85cf-66e22327fad1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
