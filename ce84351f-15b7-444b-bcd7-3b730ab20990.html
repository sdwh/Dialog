Are you ready for our RPG game today?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A! I even made some popcorn to fuel our marathon session.<p class=message>Hah, that's a great idea. How about we start by exploring the new castle?<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Have you read anything about this castle? I heard there are some pretty tricky traps.<p class=message>Yeah, I did some research. Apparently, there's a room with invisible walls.<p class="message sent">Invisible walls? How are we supposed to get through them?<p class=message>We need to look for the secret switch. But be careful, there are also some hidden enemies in the room.<p class="message sent">Yikes, we can't let our guard down. Do you have any tips on how to deal with them?<p class=message>It depends on the type of enemy. Some are weak against fire, while others are vulnerable to poison.<p class="message sent">Got it! I'll make sure to equip my flaming sword and poison arrows. What about healing potions?<p class=message>Always a good idea to have a few on hand, just in case. Hey, did you see that treasure chest over there?<p class="message sent">Where? I don't see it.<p class=message>Exactly! It's a mimic. Don't open it, or you'll be in for a nasty surprise.<p class="message sent">You saved my life, A. I owe you one. Let's keep going, I'm excited to see what else this castle has in store for us.<p class=message>Same here, B. We make a great team. Let's show those enemies who's boss!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ce839374-2cc2-4c4b-b2d9-25298e453d5a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
