How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm looking for some medicine for my baby. He has a cough and a runny nose.<p class=message>I see. How old is your baby?<p class="message sent">He's seven months old.<p class=message>Alright. We have some options for infants around that age. Have you tried anything before?<p class="message sent">No, this is the first time I'm buying medicine for him.<p class=message>Well, we have some cough syrups and nasal drops that could work. They are specifically made for infants. Let me show you some options.<p class="message sent">Thank you. What's the difference between these brands?<p class=message>Essentially, they all have the same active ingredients, but some may taste better to your baby or have different dosages. Some of them contain acetaminophen, which can help with fever or pain. It's important to read the label carefully and follow the recommended dosage based on your baby's weight.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I think I'll go with this one, it says it's grape-flavored.<p class=message>Great choice! Keep in mind that it may take a few days for the medicine to take effect. If his symptoms worsen or don't improve, please contact your doctor.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your help. It can be confusing to choose the right medicine for babies.<p class=message>No problem at all. It's always better to ask and make sure you're giving your baby the best care possible. Do you need anything else?<p class="message sent">No, I think that's it. Thanks again!<p class=message>You're welcome. Have a good day and take care of your little one!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7d0bd3bd-7afa-426d-8300-54b20c72f4b3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
