So, what's on your mind?<p class=message>I was thinking about our current system for managing all the booking data.<p class="message sent">Oh, the one that's been giving us some trouble lately?<p class=message>Yeah, exactly. I think we need to come up with a better way to handle all the bookings.<p class="message sent">What kind of changes do you have in mind?<p class=message>I was thinking about upgrading our database management system.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. Which system were you thinking of?<p class=message>I was looking at some of the new cloud-based systems. They can handle a lot more data and will be more cost-effective in the long run.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. We're dealing with a lot of data, and it's only getting bigger.<p class=message>Exactly. And with all the bookings we're getting these days, we need a better system to keep up.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. Let's start looking into some cloud-based systems to see which one would work best for us.<p class=message>Great, I'll start doing some research and send over the options to you.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Thanks for bringing this up, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. It's always better to address these issues early on before they become major problems.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dcde8875-2453-411d-98e2-75f6a491ad9b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
