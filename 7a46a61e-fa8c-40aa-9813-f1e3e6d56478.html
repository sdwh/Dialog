I usually use my credit card for online transactions.<p class=message>Oh, I see. I don't have a credit card, though. Is there any other way?<p class="message sent">Well, you can also use a debit card or Paypal.<p class=message>Hmm, I don't have Paypal either. How does that work?<p class="message sent">It's like an online wallet where you can store money and use it to pay for things online.<p class=message>That sounds convenient. But what if someone hacks into my Paypal account?<p class="message sent">Paypal actually has security measures to prevent that from happening. Plus, they have a buyer protection policy, so you can get your money back if something goes wrong.<p class=message>That's reassuring. Thanks for the info. But what about those e-wallets like Apple Pay or Google Wallet? Have you used those before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. They're also convenient because you can just link your credit or debit card to your phone and pay with it.<p class=message>Wow, technology these days. I feel like a dinosaur.<p class="message sent">Haha, don't worry about it. It's never too late to start using these convenient payment methods.<p class=message>Alright, I think I'll try setting up a Paypal account then. Do you have any tips for me?<p class="message sent">Just make sure to use a strong password and enable two-factor authentication. That should keep your account secure.<p class=message>Thanks for the help. I owe you one.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help out. Just make sure to pay me back next time we split a bill.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7a443fc1-0a27-46f6-a0cd-6b82f8927ac2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
