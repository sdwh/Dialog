Have you watered those lavender plants?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Yes, I did earlier this morning. They are looking lovely, aren't they?<p class=message>Yes, they are. And speaking of lovely, have you seen the new rose bushes I planted?<p class="message sent">I have! They are breathtaking. I love the pink and cream colors.<p class=message>Iâ€™m glad you like them. Speaking of colors, what do you think about adding some orange marigolds to the garden?<p class="message sent">That would be a great addition! They would add some pop of color.<p class=message>I agree. Let's plant some this afternoon. How are the hedges coming along?<p class="message sent">They need to be trimmed soon. But first, we need to deal with those weeds on the left side of the garden.<p class=message>Oh, the pesky weeds. Let's make sure we uproot them properly, so they won't come back anymore.<p class="message sent">Good idea. And we also need to add some new mulch to the garden beds to keep the soil moist.<p class=message>Absolutely. We can take care of that tomorrow. Do you have any suggestions on what type of mulch to use?<p class="message sent">How about a mixture of pine bark and cedar chips? That should do the trick.<p class=message>Sounds perfect! Let's make sure we have everything ready for tomorrow then.<p class="message sent">Will do! By the way, have you thought about adding a pond to the garden?<p class=message>A pond would definitely add a nice touch. Let's brainstorm some ideas and see if we can make it happen.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! We can take some time to really make it beautiful.<p class=message>That's the spirit. It's always great working with you, B.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A! We always make a great team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5fde4488-6d7c-451d-8101-398fa8dda2ba.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
