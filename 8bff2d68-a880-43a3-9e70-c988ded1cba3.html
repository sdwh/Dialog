But who's going to leave the tips?<p class=message>I have no problem taking the responsibility, but do you want to split them evenly?<p class="message sent">Definitely, it's always good to appreciate good service. Plus, it won't really add much to the bill.<p class=message>Agreed. By the way, I couldn't finish my burger. Do you want to share it or should I get it packed?<p class="message sent">I would love to, but I'm feeling pretty full already. Why don't you take it home?<p class=message>That's a great idea. I hate wasting food anyway. Do you have any leftovers you want packed?<p class="message sent">No, but thanks for asking. I'm glad we're both environmentally conscious.<p class=message>For sure, we should all do our part. Speaking of being conscious, did you hear about the new restaurant that uses all organic ingredients?<p class="message sent">No way! That sounds amazing. Let's check it out next time.<p class=message>Definitely, I can't wait to try it. Are you ready to head back now?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, let me just grab my coat. Thanks for going Dutch and for the great conversation.<p class=message>Anytime, my friend. See you soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8bfba4ca-fd55-4c59-84d5-19b5b5337852.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
