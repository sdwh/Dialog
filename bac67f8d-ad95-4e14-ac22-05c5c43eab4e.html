What can I do?<p class=message>Hmm, let me see. Have you tried talking to your landlord and explaining the situation?<p class="message sent">Yes, but he's being very uncooperative and won't even return my calls.<p class=message>Okay, in that case, we can file a lawsuit against him. Do you have any evidence that you left the apartment in good condition?<p class="message sent">Yes, I took pictures before I left and they clearly show that everything was clean and in good shape.<p class=message>Great, that will definitely help our case. Let me take a look at the pictures and we can get started on the lawsuit.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much. I was really worried I wouldn't be able to get my money back.<p class=message>It's our job to help you with these kinds of situations. And who knows, maybe we'll even get you some extra compensation for the trouble your landlord caused you.<p class="message sent">Ha! I like the sound of that. You're not like most lawyers. You have a good sense of humor.<p class=message>Well, we can't always be serious, can we? Plus, I find that humor helps to break the tension in some of these situations.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Thanks for making me feel comfortable and for helping me with my legal problem.<p class=message>Of course, that's what we're here for. Let's get started on your case and hopefully, we'll have a positive outcome.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=babb9d38-7b93-4b06-8e22-69d1e3e5167f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
