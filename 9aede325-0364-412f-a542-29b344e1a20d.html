What do you think about it?<p class=message>I think it looks great, but I noticed that it's only in English.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I noticed that too. I wonder why they didn't make it multilingual?<p class=message>Maybe they thought it would be too difficult to design for multiple languages?<p class="message sent">I'm not sure. There are so many tools available now to make multilingual websites.<p class=message>True. And it's becoming more and more important to have a global presence online.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I wouldn't be surprised if they add more languages in the future.<p class=message>I hope so. It would be great to see the website in other languages.<p class="message sent">Plus, it would attract a larger audience from different countries.<p class=message>Definitely. And it could even increase sales or engagement.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Have you ever tried designing a multilingual website?<p class=message>I haven't, but I've heard it can be a bit tricky with all the different language nuances.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it can be challenging, but it's also a great opportunity to learn about different cultures.<p class=message>That's true. And it's a way to show that your business values diversity and inclusion.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Well, hopefully the website designers will catch on soon and make it multilingual.<p class=message>Agreed. Until then, we'll just have to brush up on our English skills.<p class="message sent">Haha, or use Google Translate. But it's always better to have a website in your own language.<p class=message>Definitely. It makes the user experience much more pleasant and accessible.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9ae0cb54-f2f2-4ae0-927c-d589de469f16.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
