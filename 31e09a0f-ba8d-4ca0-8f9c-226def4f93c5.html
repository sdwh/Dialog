What's your seat number?<p class=message>It's 22A.<p class="message sent">Okay, you're in luck. That's just a few rows away. Follow me, please.<p class=message>Thank you so much.<p class="message sent">No problem. By the way, have you flown with us before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time.<p class="message sent">Well, welcome aboard! Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>Actually, I have a question about the safety instructions.<p class="message sent">Sure, what do you need to know?<p class=message>What's the proper way to put on the oxygen mask?<p class="message sent">Ah, that's an important one. You'll want to place it over your nose and mouth, adjust the straps, and breathe normally. Remember to secure your own mask before helping others.<p class=message>Got it. Sounds easy enough. Thanks for explaining.<p class="message sent">No problem. Is there anything else you're curious about?<p class=message>Actually, I've heard that airline food isn't very good. Can you prove that stereotype wrong?<p class="message sent">(laughs) I'm afraid I can't guarantee you'll love everything, but we have some pretty tasty options. What do you usually like to eat?<p class=message>I'm a big fan of chicken and pasta dishes.<p class="message sent">Great, we have both on this flight. I hope you find something you enjoy.<p class=message>Thank you! You've been so helpful.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure.
