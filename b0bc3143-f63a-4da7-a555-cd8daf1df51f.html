Do you have your baggage ticket with you?<p class=message>Yes, I do. *hands over the baggage ticket*<p class="message sent">Great! It looks like your baggage will be on carousel number 4.<p class=message>Thank you so much. Do you know if there's a coffee shop nearby? I am in desperate need of a caffeine fix!<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Just head towards the main entrance of the airport and take a right. You'll see a Starbucks there.<p class=message>That sounds perfect! I can't function without my morning coffee.<p class="message sent">I totally understand. What's your usual order?<p class=message>A vanilla latte, please. What about you?<p class="message sent">I'm more of a tea person myself, but I do enjoy the occasional coffee. Have you had a chance to explore the city yet?<p class=message>Not just yet, but I plan to. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">You have to try the local cuisine. There's a terrific restaurant on Market Street that serves the best seafood in town.<p class=message>I'll definitely have to check that out. Thank you for the tip!<p class="message sent">Not a problem at all. That's what I'm here for. Did you have a pleasant flight?<p class=message>Yes, it was great. The in-flight entertainment really helped make the time fly by. Do you have any recommendations for a good book to read during my vacation?<p class="message sent">If you're into mystery novels, I recommend anything by Agatha Christie. Her books are a great way to unwind and get lost in a good story.<p class=message>That sounds perfect! Thank you so much for your help. You've been amazing.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure! Enjoy your stay in the city, and don't hesitate to come back if you need any more assistance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b0bb7c5d-ca5e-44cd-98f6-7c69dbd7d12f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
