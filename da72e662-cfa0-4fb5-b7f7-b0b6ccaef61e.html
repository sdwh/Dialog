Have you tried it yet?<p class=message>Yeah, I actually just took the TOEIC Gold test, and it was challenging but worth it.<p class="message sent">Good for you! I'm thinking about taking the test too, but I'm a bit nervous.<p class=message>Don't worry, the test is designed to measure your current level. Just prepare well and you'll do fine.<p class="message sent">How did you prepare for it?<p class=message>I practiced a lot of reading and listening exercises, and I went to a few language classes.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. How long did it take you to finish the test?<p class=message>It took me about two hours in total. There are two parts, listening and reading.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Do you know what kind of score I need to pass the test?<p class=message>You need to score at least 785 to pass the Gold level. But don't worry if you don't pass on your first try, you can always try again.<p class="message sent">That's reassuring. I think I'll sign up for the test soon.<p class=message>Awesome! Let me know if you need any help with the preparation. We can study together.<p class="message sent">That would be great. Thanks for the offer!<p class=message>No problem. We can also make it fun by turning it into a friendly competition.<p class="message sent">Ha! Challenge accepted.<p class=message>Alright, we'll see who gets the Gold status first!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=da70eaf9-5522-47cd-a243-a72dd96d4982.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
