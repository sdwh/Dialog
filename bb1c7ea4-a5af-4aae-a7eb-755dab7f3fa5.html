I hope it won't affect our fishing industry.<p class="message sent">We have done our research and we plan to install our devices in a way that avoids disrupting the migration paths of fish.<p class=message>Well, that's good to hear. We rely on the sea for a living, so we need to make sure our catch isn't affected.<p class="message sent">I completely understand. We want to work with the local community to make sure everyone benefits from this project.<p class=message>Sounds fair. Will you be hiring local workers for the project?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's our plan. We want to stimulate the economy and provide job opportunities for the people here.<p class=message>Great, that's music to my ears. I was worried this project might harm our environment and our livelihoods.<p class="message sent">We are committed to minimizing the impact of our operations on the environment and the local community.<p class=message>That's reassuring. I'm glad we can work together to make sure this project benefits everyone in the long run.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We have a responsibility to protect the ocean and its resources, and we can only do that by working in harmony with the community.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Now, let's get down to some serious fishing while enjoying the calm sea.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great plan! And who knows, maybe our project will help keep the sea abundant with fish for years to come.<p class=message>I'm all for that. Maybe one day we can all enjoy a nice seafood meal together.<p class="message sent">Ha, I'd love that. Nothing like bonding over a delicious meal and some fresh ocean air.<p class=message>You got that right! Alright then, let's get fishing.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bb1c0b45-1476-4bbb-a674-539ad86c8fcb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
