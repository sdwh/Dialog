That's great. As a web designer, I am trying to design an interactive and user-friendly travel planning feature. Any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Well, I think the first thing to consider is the user interface. It should be intuitive and easy to use.<p class=message>That's true. What about the functionality? What features should we include?<p class="message sent">I suggest we include features that allow users to add locations to their itinerary, set time and date, and also include notes and photos for each location.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. What about adding a map feature?<p class="message sent">Yes, that would be useful too. Users can visualize their itinerary more easily.<p class=message>How about the social sharing function? Should we add that too?<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely. Users can share their trip plans with friends and also get recommendations.<p class=message>Good point. How about the language support? Should we include multiple languages?<p class="message sent">Yes, we should. It will cater to a wider range of users and make the app more accessible.<p class=message>I see your point. Would it be possible to integrate the app with flight and hotel booking platforms?<p class="message sent">Yes, that would be amazing! Users can plan their whole trip in one app and book everything right away.<p class=message>That's great. We should also consider the app's scalability and security.<p class="message sent">Yes, we should make sure it can handle a large number of users and data is well-protected.<p class=message>Agreed. What do you think about adding a search feature to the app?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's important too. Users should be able to search for specific locations, activities or accommodations easily.<p class=message>Alright, we have a lot of great ideas for this app. I am looking forward to working on it with you.<p class="message sent">Me too, let's get started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7673ea28-1d79-47b4-ba7c-0bdc105795f0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
