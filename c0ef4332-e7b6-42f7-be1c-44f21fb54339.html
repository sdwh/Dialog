I don't even know where to start.<p class="message sent">That's why I'm here to help you out, A. Long time no see, by the way.<p class=message>Yes, it's been a while since I've been to this fish market. I'm excited to explore it with you.<p class="message sent">Let's start with some sashimi-grade tuna. How about that?<p class=message>Sounds great. I think I want to make some sushi for tonight's dinner.<p class="message sent">Good choice. Now, let's move on to the shellfish section. How about some scallops?<p class=message>Hmm, do you think they will be good on the grill? I want to try grilling them for the first time.<p class="message sent">Definitely! I can show you how to prepare them. Speaking of which, have you tried Nagasaki's famous dish, champon?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it difficult to make?<p class="message sent">Not really. It's a noodle dish with seafood and vegetables in a rich broth. We can buy the ingredients here and cook it together later.<p class=message>That sounds fun! I can't wait to learn some local cooking techniques from you.<p class="message sent">I'm happy to share my knowledge. Oh, look over there! They have fresh octopus.<p class=message>Ooh, octopus! I haven't cooked with that before. Can you teach me a recipe?<p class="message sent">Of course. We can make takoyaki, which is a popular street food in Japan.<p class=message>Takoyaki? I've heard of that but never tried it.<p class="message sent">It's like a round, savory pancake with diced octopus inside. You can also add some sauce and toppings to it.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. Let's get some octopus and try making it.<p class="message sent">Great! I'm looking forward to cooking with you, A.<p class=message>Thanks for your help, B. I'm excited to try new recipes and techniques with all these fresh ingredients.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c0eb8073-4169-49a3-968a-56dd214fe280.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
