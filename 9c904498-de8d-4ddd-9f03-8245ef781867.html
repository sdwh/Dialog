What game is it?<p class=message>It's called Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It's really fun and relaxing.<p class="message sent">Oh, I've heard of that game. It's like a virtual island where you can build your own house and stuff, right?<p class=message>Yeah, that's right! You should try it out. It's great for escaping reality for a bit.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect, especially during these crazy times. Let's play it together sometime!<p class=message>Definitely! We can visit each other's islands and trade items. It'll be fun.<p class="message sent">Speaking of items, have you seen the new ones in Fortnite? The skins are so cool.<p class=message>I know, right? I'm really tempted to buy the new Deadpool skin.<p class="message sent">Haha, you're such a fanboy. But I can't blame you, the skin looks awesome.<p class=message>I can't help it, man. Deadpool is one of my favorite characters.<p class="message sent">Have you seen the movies? They're hilarious.<p class=message>Of course! Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Speaking of movies, have you heard of the new Sonic the Hedgehog movie?<p class=message>Yeah, I saw it a few weeks ago! It was surprisingly good.<p class="message sent">Really? I heard mixed reviews about it.<p class=message>Yeah, I was skeptical at first too, but it was actually enjoyable. Plus, Jim Carrey was great as Dr. Robotnik.<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe I'll give it a try then. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class=message>Anytime, man. Let's plan a gaming night soon and try out some of these new games together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9c90215a-12e5-4894-a71a-d862ba33c2b0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
