How's it going at the market today?<p class="message sent">Oh, not too bad. It's been a pretty busy morning so far. How about you? Any exciting new catches at the restaurant?<p class=message>Actually, we just got in a shipment of live crabs and lobsters this morning. They're still kicking and screaming!<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. I'll have to make sure to swing by and check them out later.<p class=message>You should! And while you're at it, we also have some fresh clams and mussels that just came in yesterday. Perfect for a seafood linguine or paella.<p class="message sent">Mmm, that sounds delicious. You know how to get a seafood lover's heart racing.<p class=message>Haha, thanks. I try my best. So, any tips on what I should keep an eye out for at the market today?<p class="message sent">Definitely keep an eye out for the sashimi-grade tuna. It's just come in from Japan and it's some of the best we've had in a while.<p class=message>Oh, good to know. We have a lot of customers who love our tuna sashimi. I don't want to disappoint them.<p class="message sent">You won't. And if you're feeling adventurous, we also got in some fresh octopus that would be perfect for grilling.<p class=message>That does sound adventurous! I think I'll leave that to your expert chefs. I know they'll do it justice.<p class="message sent">You know, I'm really glad we have this partnership. We make a pretty great team when it comes to bringing in the freshest seafood for our customers.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. It's always great to work with someone who has the same passion for quality seafood as I do.<p class="message sent">Well, it looks like I better get going if I want to snag some of that live crab and lobster before they're all gone.<p class=message>Yes, don't wait too long or they might just walk out of here on their own!<p class="message sent">Haha, I'll keep that in mind. See you soon, A.<p class=message>Take care, B.
