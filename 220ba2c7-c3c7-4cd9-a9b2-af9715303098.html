How are you this fine day?<p class="message sent">I'm great, A, especially since the smell of freshly baked bread is filling the air.<p class=message>Yes, the loaves have just come out of the oven! Now it's your turn to work your coffee magic and make our customers' day.<p class="message sent">You got it, A. What's the most popular drink today?<p class=message>Based on yesterday, I'd say it's the latte. But let's not forget about the cappuccino and iced coffee either.<p class="message sent">Understood, A. By the way, have you tried the new French toast we have on sale today? It's topped with berries and whipped cream.<p class=message>I haven't, but it sounds delicious. We'll have to trade one of my baguettes for a piece of your French toast!<p class="message sent">Deal! How's business been so far?<p class=message>It's been steady, with a few regulars dropped in already. But it really gets going around lunchtime, so we have to stay on our toes.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. By the way, did you hear about the baking competition being held next week? I'm thinking of entering my signature coffee cake.<p class=message>That's awesome, B! And I'm sure you'll win with that recipe. Maybe I'll enter my garlic bread to balance out the sweetness!<p class="message sent">Great idea, A. I love it when our food and drink complement each other so well. Speaking of which, can I interest you in a latte while you put the finishing touches on those baguettes?<p class=message>Sounds perfect, B. Thanks for always being a great partner in this baking and brewing adventure!<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. We make a great team. Here's your latte. Cheers to another successful day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=22087354-ce7c-4fbc-a635-37fab349976c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
