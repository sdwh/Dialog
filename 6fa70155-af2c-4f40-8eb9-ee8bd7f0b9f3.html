How is the production process going so far?<p class="message sent">It's going great! Our team is finishing up the final batch of kimchi for the day.<p class=message>Fantastic! I'm excited to taste it. Could you explain to me the steps you take to make the perfect kimchi?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. We start by soaking the cabbage in saltwater, then we mix the chili paste with different spices and ingredients like garlic and ginger.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I've always admired the art of fermenting vegetables. How do you determine when the fermentation process is complete?<p class="message sent">It's all about the taste and smell. Once the kimchi has a tangy flavor and a distinct aroma, we know it's ready to be eaten.<p class=message>I can imagine the level of patience and attention to detail needed to make quality kimchi. Has your production process changed over time?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We've started experimenting with new spices and ingredients to add more depth and flavor to our kimchi. Plus, we've adopted a more eco-friendly approach by using reusable containers.<p class=message>That's terrific. I appreciate how the food industry is progressively moving towards sustainability. Are there any challenges you face in making kimchi?<p class="message sent">Sometimes the weather can affect the fermentation process, especially during the winter. But we've learned to adjust the temperature and humidity levels accordingly.<p class=message>I guess it's all about being flexible and adaptable, right? By the way, have you tried making any other fermented foods besides kimchi?<p class="message sent">Yes, we've recently started experimenting with kombucha as well. It's been a fun and exciting journey.<p class=message>Wow, that's amazing. You truly are a master of fermentation! Thanks for chatting with me, it's been a pleasure.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Thanks for your interest in our craft. I hope you enjoy the kimchi!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6fa61b42-3ebe-405c-a430-733d95e9bca6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
