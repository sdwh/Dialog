How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing well, thanks! How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too. So, let's get straight to business. We are here to conduct a compliance audit for ISO 27001.<p class="message sent">Yup, I am aware of that. Anything specific you need me to show you?<p class=message>Well, we need to see evidence of your implementation of information security management system controls.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Let me just grab my password manager... oh wait, I forgot the password to my password manager!<p class=message>*laughs* That's amusing. Don't worry, that's pretty common. Always remember to have a backup plan.<p class="message sent">Yeah, definitely learned that the hard way. But don't worry, I have a written copy of my passwords stored in a secure location.<p class=message>That's smart. Another important thing is to always keep your system updated with the latest security patches.<p class="message sent">Absolutely agreed. We can never let our guard down when it comes to cyber attacks.<p class=message>True, prevention is always better than cure.<p class="message sent">By the way, have you heard about that new phishing technique where attackers send fake job offers to lure victims into giving away personal information?<p class=message>No, I haven't. That's a new one on me.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's scary how creative these hackers can be!<p class=message>Agreed. But let's focus on our audit for now. Do you have any questions or concerns for me?<p class="message sent">No, I think we covered everything. Let's get started!<p class=message>Perfect, let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ff1df79e-af01-4dfc-9753-ba25bb268eb3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
