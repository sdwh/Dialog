How are you doing today?<p class="message sent message-content">Hi A. I'm good, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class="message received message-content">I'm doing fine. So, I wanted to discuss the progress of our project with you. How is it going?<p class="message sent message-content">We're moving forward, but there are some hurdles in the way.<p class="message received message-content">What kind of hurdles? Can you elaborate on that?<p class="message sent message-content">Well, we have some issues with the database integration. It's taking longer than expected.<p class="message received message-content">I see. So, what's the plan to overcome this problem?<p class="message sent message-content">We're trying to implement some new approaches to speed up the process and minimize the errors.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds promising. How long do you think it will take to fix the problem?<p class="message sent message-content">I estimate two or three days at the most.<p class="message received message-content">Alright. Let's revise our progress report to reflect the delay and the new timeline for finishing this phase.<p class="message sent message-content">Sure thing. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?<p class="message received message-content">Well, have you heard about that new restaurant that just opened up downtown?<p class="message sent message-content">No, I haven't. What's special about it?<p class="message received message-content">They serve the best sushi in town! It's worth checking out.<p class="message sent message-content">I love sushi! When are you planning to go there?<p class="message received message-content">Let's go there for lunch today. There's a discount for the first 10 customers.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds fantastic! Let's go.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0d4db342-5b07-436e-be60-8f964d3d5c4b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
