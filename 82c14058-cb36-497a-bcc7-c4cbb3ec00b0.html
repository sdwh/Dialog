Exciting stuff!<p class=message>Definitely! I'm pretty familiar with HTML and CSS, but I've never really worked with Razor syntax. Any tips?<p class="message sent">It's not too different from other scripting languages, just remember to use the @ symbol at the beginning of your Razor code.<p class=message>Got it. And I heard that Razor Pages also uses a client-side programming language like JavaScript?<p class="message sent">Yup, we'll be using some jQuery and Ajax for the site's client-side functionality. But don't worry, I'll handle most of that.<p class=message>Haha, thanks B. You're always the back-end guru.<p class="message sent">And you're the front-end wiz, A. What do you have planned for the site's design?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of using some cool CSS animations for the dropdown menus and maybe some typography design.<p class="message sent">Nice! I'll make sure to leave some room for your creative touch.<p class=message>Speaking of design, have you seen the company's new logo? I think it's pretty slick.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I love the modern look. Speaking of which, did you hear that our boss wants to add a new page for employee testimonials?<p class=message>That's a great idea! It'll boost employee morale and social proof for potential clients. But how are we going to implement that?<p class="message sent">Easy. We'll just create a new Razor Page to handle the form submissions and store the testimonials in a database. I'll take care of the back-end logic, and you can design the form.<p class=message>Perfect! This project is going to be a great collaboration between back-end and front-end. Can't wait to see the final product.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=82b6ddf8-ce7b-4dea-9555-5975c91d999d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
