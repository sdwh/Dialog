How are you doing with the image processing algorithms?<p class="message sent">I'm doing fine, but I'm trying to make them work faster. It's taking too much time.<p class=message>Yeah, I understand your pain. Have you considered using some parallel processing for your algorithms?<p class="message sent">I have thought about it, but I'm not sure how to optimize those properly. Do you have any ideas?<p class=message>Actually, I have some experience with parallel processing. Maybe I could work with you to optimize these algorithms.<p class="message sent">That would be incredibly helpful! Thank you so much. Do you want to grab a coffee and work on this?<p class=message>Sure, but can we do it over the video conference? We want to be socially distant for now.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Do you want to use Google Meet or Zoom for the conference?<p class=message>Let's use Zoom; I have a better internet connection on that.<p class="message sent">Great. I'll send you an invite via email.<p class=message>Sounds good, I'll look for it in my inbox. What do you think will be the biggest challenge we'll face?<p class="message sent">Well, I think the biggest challenge we will face is how to scale these parallel processing algorithms, and what kind of schemes and data structures would be optimal.<p class=message>I agree. But that's what makes problem-solving in computer science so much fun!<p class="message sent">That's true! We will be like detectives, finding solutions for our clients.<p class=message>Speaking of that, if we succeed in optimizing these algorithms, hopefully, we'll get more clients, and thus, more revenue.<p class="message sent">That's always a good thing. But we must not forget that our ultimate goal is to help our clients make more visually stunning images.<p class=message>Of course! We do all this for the art of the image!<p class="message sent">Haha, that's right! We're like painters, but instead of paint, we use algorithms and codes to spread beauty!<p class=message>I like the sound of that. Hopefully, we'll make some beautiful pictures together!<p class="message sent">Absolutely! That's the plan!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d8a8f35c-f45e-4a3b-b17a-232e111f6eb7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
