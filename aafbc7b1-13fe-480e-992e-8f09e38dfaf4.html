My name is Officer A. Could you please state your name?<p class="message sent">Hi Officer A. My name is B. I'm here because I got arrested for stealing a candy bar.<p class=message>B, stealing is a crime. What made you steal the candy bar?<p class="message sent">I don't know. I was just really craving sugar, and it was the closest thing in sight.<p class=message>I see. Well, we've all had those cravings. But it's important to remember that stealing is not the answer. How old are you, B?<p class="message sent">I'm 20 years old.<p class=message>It's important to learn from this mistake and understand that the consequences of stealing are serious. If you need assistance, we can help you find resources to overcome your cravings in a safe and legal way.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Officer A. I appreciate your advice.<p class=message>No problem. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about, B?<p class="message sent">Well, can you recommend some good books to read? I have a lot of free time now.<p class=message>Of course. What type of books do you enjoy?<p class="message sent">I mostly enjoy thrillers and mysteries.<p class=message>I highly recommend the "Harry Bosch" series by Michael Connelly. They're page-turners and will keep you entertained for hours.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, Officer A. I appreciate your help.<p class=message>You're welcome, B. Remember, stealing is never the answer. Have a good day.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Officer A. You too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aaeebff5-17db-43ea-9e9e-7931394196ac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
