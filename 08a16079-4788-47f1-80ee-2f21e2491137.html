Let's go grab some popcorn and drinks before we start the movie.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll go get them. Do you want anything specific?<p class=message>Just some Coke and maybe some candy too. Surprise me!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Alright, I'll be back in a few minutes.<p class=message>Wow, this movie is hilarious! I can't believe I haven't heard of it before.<p class="message sent">I know, right? The jokes are so funny.<p class=message>Did you know the lead actor wrote the script for the movie too? He's a genius.<p class="message sent">No way! That makes it even better.<p class=message>(pauses the movie) Hey B, do you ever think about writing your own movie someday?<p class="message sent">(surprised) Not really, but I do enjoy writing short stories.<p class=message>That's great! Maybe you could turn one of your stories into a screenplay someday.<p class="message sent">(smiling) That would be amazing. Thanks for the encouragement, Dad.<p class=message>Of course, I believe in you. Now let's finish this movie and see how it ends!<p class="message sent">(as the credits roll) That was such a good movie, I don't think I've laughed that hard in a long time.<p class=message>Agreed, it was a great choice. Thanks for suggesting it, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, Dad. Maybe next time we can watch that new action movie you've been wanting to see.<p class=message>(smiling) Sounds like a plan. Let's make it happen.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=089b7dfe-72bf-4540-8331-1f786ef92ae8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
