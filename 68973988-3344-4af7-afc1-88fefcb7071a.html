How’s it going?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Bonjour! It’s going great, thanks for asking. I’m just finishing up some baguettes for the day.<p class=message>Ah! That reminds me, I need to make more coffee beans for today’s rush. By the way, those baguettes look so crispy and delicious.<p class="message sent">Merci beaucoup! I’m quite proud of them. Have you tried pairing them with our classic French press coffee? It’s a match made in heaven!<p class=message>Of course, I have! You know me, I can’t resist a good artisanal loaf. Speaking of pairings, have you thought about making some croissants with those baguettes?<p class="message sent">As a matter of fact, I have. I’m experimenting with a new recipe that incorporates the baguette dough. Do you want to taste it?<p class=message>I’d be delighted to! Nothing beats freshly baked croissants, especially if it’s infused with French baguette.<p class="message sent">Ok, let me just pop them in the oven real quick. While we wait, how’s your coffee brewing going? Any new blends that we should try?<p class=message>Actually yes, I’ve just received a new shipment of Ethiopian beans. They have a fruity undertone that would go well with your croissant recipe.<p class="message sent">Oooh, that sounds intriguing. And I bet it will go perfectly with our raspberry jam spread. Speaking of which, have you tried our new rose petal jam?<p class=message>Not yet, but it sounds like something my customers would love. We should definitely highlight it in our next pairing menu.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I also suggest making some brioche loaves with the rose petal jam swirl. It’s a unique twist to a classic pastry.<p class=message>Brilliant idea, B! You never cease to amaze me with your creative twists to French classics. The croissants are smelling amazing, by the way.<p class="message sent">Thanks! I think they’re ready. Let’s have a sip of our coffee and try them out, shall we?<p class=message>Perfect idea! Here’s to another successful collaboration in the heart of Strasbourg. Santé!<p class="message sent">Cheers, mon ami!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6896c0cc-5f63-4f83-b272-d2e2334bcbe8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
