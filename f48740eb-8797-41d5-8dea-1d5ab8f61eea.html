Sushi is one of my favorite foods. How about you?<p class=message>Well, I've had it a few times, but I'm not really an expert on it.<p class="message sent">Oh, no worries. I can show you the ropes. What kind of sushi do you usually get?<p class=message>Honestly, I usually just get the California roll because it's the only one I know.<p class="message sent">Ha! That's the classic beginner's sushi. Let's try something a little more adventurous like a spider roll or a rainbow roll.<p class=message>Hmm, I don't know about spider rolls. That sounds a bit creepy.<p class="message sent">Don't worry - there's no actual spider in it! It's just soft shell crab. And the rainbow roll is so pretty, you'll forget you're even eating sushi.<p class=message>Alright, let's give it a go then. But what's the proper way to eat sushi?<p class="message sent">Well, you can use chopsticks or your hands. And donâ€™t forget to dip the sushi in soy sauce before eating it.<p class=message>Got it. And what's the green stuff that's usually on the plate?<p class="message sent">That's wasabi! It's a Japanese horseradish and it gives the sushi a little kick.<p class=message>Ooh, I like some spice. I'll have to try that.<p class="message sent">Don't go overboard though, it's pretty strong. And make sure to save some room for mochi ice cream for dessert!<p class=message>Mochi ice cream?! I've never heard of that before.<p class="message sent">It's a small ice cream ball wrapped in sweet sticky rice. You're going to love it!<p class=message>Wow, sushi sounds like a whole experience. I'm excited to try new things.<p class="message sent">I'm glad I could introduce you to the wonderful world of sushi. Let's go grab some now!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f48499d2-82ff-4394-9672-3593d6e3ed05.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
