That's a fancy way to trick people into giving away their confidential information, right?<p class=message>Exactly! But it's not just about tricking people, it's also about raising awareness and preventing these kinds of attacks.<p class="message sent">I see what you mean. It's like the "con" part of "confidence game".<p class=message>Yep, and speaking of games, have you ever played "Two Truths and a Lie"?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I love that game!<p class=message>Well, ISO 27001 Social Engineering is like playing the opposite of that game. You have to figure out which statement is the lie, and not fall for it.<p class="message sent">That's a good analogy! And it's not just about email phishing, but also in-person interactions and phone calls.<p class=message>Right, and it's not just about preventing attacks on your organization, but also protecting your personal information as well.<p class="message sent">Yeah, because we all have that one relative who falls for every scam email they receive.<p class=message>Haha, true. So, I guess the ultimate goal of ISO 27001 Social Engineering is to make us all a little bit more skeptical and a little bit less trusting.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good thing to me. Can't be too careful these days.<p class=message>Agreed. So, how about we play a quick round of "Two Truths and a Lie" to practice our skepticism skills?<p class="message sent">Oh, you're on!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d6cb2e4f-741b-4323-8029-2f308d9f3c28.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
