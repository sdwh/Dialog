How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm also on a business trip, but I'm lucky enough to have a couple days off at my destination to explore.<p class=message>That sounds like a great perk of the job. Do you have any recommendations for places to see or things to do at your destination?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! There's a beautiful park with stunning views of the city, and some of the best local cuisine is found at a nearby food market.<p class=message>That sounds amazing, thank you for the advice. I'll have to check those out.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, enjoy your flight and your trip! Don't hesitate to let me know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c4ece37f-61c6-43a5-bf0c-a4548c3b4d6e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
