How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey there, A! Not too bad, thanks. Just trying to keep up with all these orders. How about you?<p class=message>Same here! It's been hectic in the kitchen. But hey, that's what we signed up for, right?<p class="message sent">That's right! I couldn't imagine doing anything else. By the way, what are you whipping up today?<p class=message>We've got a big order for barbecue sauce, so I'm chopping up a bunch of jalape√±os and onions right now.<p class="message sent">Ooh, that sounds spicy! I hope you don't run out of milk to soothe the burn.<p class=message>(laughs) Don't worry, we've got plenty of dairy on standby. What about you? Where are you headed next?<p class="message sent">I'm delivering a truckload of fresh produce to a restaurant downtown. I guess they're really into farm-to-table cuisine.<p class=message>Nice! You should send me some pictures so I can get some cooking inspiration.<p class="message sent">Will do! Say, have you tried that new taco place around the corner yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've heard good things. Maybe we should check it out sometime after work.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'll even bring some of my homemade salsa to spice things up.<p class=message>Now that's what I'm talking about! I'll bring the margaritas.<p class="message sent">You got it! But please, leave the blender at home this time.<p class=message>(laughs) Hey, that was one time! But fair enough. We'll keep it classy.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit. Alright, I better get back on the road. Keep cranking out those orders, A!<p class=message>You too, B! And don't forget to text me those food pics.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f1d31dcd-1041-452b-82f1-57c7e406b371.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
