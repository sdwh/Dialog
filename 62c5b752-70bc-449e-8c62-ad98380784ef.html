Let's start today's lesson by discussing idioms. Can anyone give me an example of an idiom that you've heard before?<p class="message sent">How about "raining cats and dogs"? I've heard that one a lot.<p class=message>Great job, B! That's a perfect example of an idiom. Can you tell me what it means?<p class="message sent">It means it's raining really hard outside.<p class=message>Correct! Now, does anyone know the origin of that idiom?<p class="message sent">Um, well, I'm not quite sure.<p class=message>It actually dates back to the 17th century, when people living in cities would throw their waste out of the windows onto the streets. During heavy rainfalls, the streets would flood and carry the waste, including dead animals, so it would look like it was "raining cats and dogs."<p class="message sent">Wow, that's really interesting! I never would've guessed that's where it came from.<p class=message>Yes, idioms can be both fun and informative. Let's try creating our own idioms today. Partner up and come up with an idiom to describe someone who is always late.<p class="message sent">How about "running on Dali time"?<p class=message>(Laughs) I like that one, B! That's very creative.<p class="message sent">Thank you! I had fun working on it.<p class=message>Me too, B. It's always great to see students engaged and enjoying the lesson. Keep up the good work, everyone!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=62c4b25c-2e37-4314-aee7-0bd76ba53851.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
