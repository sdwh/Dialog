We have some great options for you to taste and learn about.<p class=message>Great, I am eager to try some of your best wines. Could you tell me about the production process of your grapes?<p class="message sent">Of course, our chardonnay grapes are handpicked and we use oak barrels for fermentation. Our vineyard is nestled in the hills of Barcelona, providing ideal soil and climate for the grapes.<p class=message>Very interesting. What would be your personal favorite wine here?<p class="message sent">I must say, our Tempranillo has a unique flavor profile with a hint of smokiness. It pairs perfectly with the local cuisine.<p class=message>I must try that one. How long have you been a tour guide here?<p class="message sent">I have been giving tours at this winery for over a decade. It's always a pleasure to show people around and share our passion for wine.<p class=message>I can tell you are passionate about what you do. How do you suggest we properly taste a wine to get the full experience?<p class="message sent">First, look at the color of the wine, then swirl it to release the aromas. Take a sip and let it rest on your tongue before swallowing. The aftertaste is where the true character of the wine comes through.<p class=message>Thank you for the tips. This Tempranillo is delicious!<p class="message sent">I'm glad you enjoy it. Would you like to learn more about the history of the winery?<p class=message>Yes, I would love to hear about it.<p class="message sent">Well, this winery has been in my family for generations. My great grandfather started it all, and we've been expanding and perfecting our wine production ever since.<p class=message>That's amazing. I know I will be recommending this winery to all my wine-loving friends back in France.<p class="message sent">We'd love to have them. Thank you so much for coming and enjoying our wines.<p class=message>It was truly a pleasure. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and hospitality with me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b585254e-df8b-4d25-92b3-8a41370b44db.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
