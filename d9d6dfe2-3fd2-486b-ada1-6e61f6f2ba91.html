As an information security expert, I can tell you that this is a critical matter.<p class=message>I agree. As a network engineer, I also understand the importance of securing personal information.<p class="message sent">Good to hear that. Do you know the best practices to keep confidential information secure?<p class=message>Well, the first step is to limit access only to those who need it. That means creating different access levels for different users.<p class="message sent">That's right. Plus, we need to make sure that all data is encrypted, so it cannot be read by unauthorized individuals.<p class=message>Another essential step is to train staff members and students on proper data handling and security.<p class="message sent">Yes, education and awareness are key to maintaining a safe online environment.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we should also establish proper protocol in case of a data breach, so we can take quick action to minimize the damage.<p class="message sent">Sounds like you know a lot about network security.<p class=message>I try my best. But, I still have much to learn. Maybe you can teach me some tricks.<p class="message sent">Of course, I'd be happy to share my knowledge. You know what they say, teamwork makes the dream work!<p class=message>Haha, I couldn't agree more! Together, we can protect our people's privacy and information.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d9d3eb0b-7192-4347-9138-80e87042aefc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
