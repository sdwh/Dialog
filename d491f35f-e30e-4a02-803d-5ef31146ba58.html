Do you have any suggestions for me, B?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We have a variety of tea leaves from all over China. Would you like to try something new or stick to a classic flavor?<p class=message>Hmm, I'm open to new experiences. What would you recommend?<p class="message sent">How about our Lapsang Souchong tea? It has a unique smoky flavor that's quite popular.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. I'd love to try that.<p class="message sent">Great! Let me brew a cup for you. Have a seat and enjoy.<p class=message>Wow, this tea is incredible! I've never tasted anything like it before.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it. We also have some sweet osmanthus oolong tea if you'd like to try something with a floral aroma.<p class=message>Sure, I'd love to. Can't miss the opportunity to try a rare tea like this in Meizhou.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. As a tea lover, Meizhou has some of the finest tea leaves in China.<p class=message>Honestly, I can't decide which one I like better. They're both so unique and delicious.<p class="message sent">Well, why don't you take both of them with you? I can pack them up and you can continue enjoying them at home.<p class=message>That's a fantastic idea! I'm sure my family will love them too. Thank you for the excellent customer service, B.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure, A. Enjoy your teas and come back anytime!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d489444f-8234-48df-bf9b-4caa36d7f542.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
