I can't believe you're already 20 years old.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Dad. I'm excited to celebrate with you and Mom.<p class=message>We're excited too. It feels like just yesterday we were celebrating your 10th birthday.<p class="message sent">Yeah, time flies. So, what's on the menu for tonight?<p class=message>We have steak, seafood, and some vegetarian options. What sounds good to you?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'll go with the seafood.<p class=message>Great choice. I'm getting the steak. What about you, Mom?<p class="message sent">Dad, do you remember that time we went to the beach and you tried to surf?<p class=message>Oh, don't remind me. I don't think I'll ever live that one down.<p class="message sent">(laughs) It was so funny though.<p class="message sent">I was thinking of going to Hawaii with some friends. Have either of you been there before?<p class=message>No, but I've always wanted to visit. Maybe we can plan a family trip there someday.<p class="message sent">That would be amazing!<p class=message>Yes, we'll have the seafood, steak, and vegetarian option please.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious. Let's get one to share.<p class=message>Agreed. This is a special occasion, after all.<p class="message sent">I'm still exploring my options, but I'm leaning towards environmental science.<p class=message>That's great to hear. We need more people taking care of our planet.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Thanks, Dad. I hope to make a difference.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=068e59fd-ac6f-4bcb-898f-6180f8dadf69.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
