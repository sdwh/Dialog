What kind of puzzles are you incorporating?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. The puzzles are a mix of logic, math, and observation. We're trying to keep the players on their toes.<p class=message>Sounds challenging but fun. What's the storyline of the game?<p class="message sent">The game is set in an ancient temple where the players have to uncover a long-lost treasure. They have to solve puzzles to unlock the doors to each room.<p class=message>That sounds intriguing. How many levels are there going to be?<p class="message sent">There are going to be 20 levels, and with each level, the puzzles will get more challenging.<p class=message>I can't wait to play it. Will there be any rewards for completing the game?<p class="message sent">Yes, we're planning to reward the players with a bonus level and a hidden treasure. But, it won't be easy to unlock.<p class=message>That sounds awesome. Is there any clue you can give me to crack the game?<p class="message sent">Well, I can tell you to think outside the box and pay close attention to your surroundings. That's all I can say for now.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I'll remember that. When can we expect the game to be released?<p class="message sent">We're hoping to release it next month. But, we have to make sure the game is perfect before we release it to the gamers.<p class=message>I understand. I'm sure it will be worth the wait.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a338e9e2-8186-4e5c-89a4-6dc80b26348d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
