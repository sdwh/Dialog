Welcome to my farm.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm Dr. B, the veterinarian. Nice to meet you.<p class=message>Thanks for coming out to check on my animals. They're like family to me.<p class="message sent">I understand. So what kind of animals do you have on your farm?<p class=message>I have cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens. They all play an important role in my livelihood.<p class="message sent">That's quite a variety. Let's get started with the check-up. I'll need to examine each animal carefully.<p class=message>Sure thing. I'll help you round them up.<p class="message sent">Great. Oh, wait a minute. Is that a shy goat hiding in the corner over there?<p class=message>Oh, that's just Dolly. She's always like that. Don't worry, she's friendly.<p class="message sent">(chuckles) Alright then, let's bring her over here. Can you hold her still for me?<p class=message>(grabs Dolly) Here you go, doc. What do you see?<p class="message sent">(examines Dolly) Well, it seems like she's a bit overweight. We'll need to adjust her diet.<p class=message>(laughs) Looks like she's been eating too many treats. Got it, no more donuts for Dolly.<p class="message sent">(joins in laughter) It happens to the best of us. Alright, let's move on to the next animal.<p class=message>(leads the way) Follow me. Here's my prized cow, Bessie. She's a beauty, isn't she?<p class="message sent">(admires Bessie) She sure is. Let's check her temperature and give her a quick physical.<p class=message>Sounds good. (aside) Hey Bessie, you're going to be famous on the vet's billboards.<p class="message sent">(overhears) (laughs) You have quite the sense of humor, Farmer A.<p class=message>(smiling) Gotta keep it light-hearted. It's always a pleasure to have visitors on the farm, especially ones as friendly as you.<p class="message sent">Likewise. You have a great operation here. I'm glad I could help ensure the health and wellbeing of your animals.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=45a3ece7-06c6-41b1-9110-1ffe23df7c2f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
