How's the food going?<p class="message sent">It's going great! I just finished cooking up some delicious fried rice. Want to give it a try?<p class=message>Sure thing! Let me grab a fork. *takes a bite* Mmm, this is amazing! I'll definitely put this on the menu.<p class="message sent">Glad you like it. So, how's business been lately?<p class=message>It's been pretty steady. We've had a lot of customers coming in for grilled meats.<p class="message sent">I'm not surprised - this city loves its meat!<p class=message>That's for sure. Have you tried any new marinades or seasonings lately?<p class="message sent">As a matter of fact, I have. I just mixed together some gochujang, honey, and garlic for a spicy yet sweet marinade.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll have to give it a try. By the way, did you catch the game last night?<p class="message sent">I did! What a nail-biter. Did you place any bets?<p class=message>Nah, I try not to mix business with pleasure. Plus, my wallet thanks me for it.<p class="message sent">Haha, I hear you. The look on your face when Park scored that goal was priceless, though.<p class=message>Hey, don't remind me. My heart rate still hasn't fully come back down from that one.<p class="message sent">Well, hopefully the food here can help you relax. How about I make you a fresh batch of bulgogi?<p class=message>Don't mind if you do. Thanks, chef!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ec7ac540-30a0-404d-855c-bb429df61a2f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
