How's grilling going?<p class="message sent">Hey A, it's going pretty well! It's always good to come out here to the countryside and do some grilling. How about your side?<p class=message>The kitchen is busy tonight. We have orders for all kinds of meat.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a lot of work, but I bet it's still fun.<p class=message>Yeah, it is! Do you have any recommendations for the drinks?<p class="message sent">Definitely! We have a new beer that just came out, and I think you'll love it. It's a light lager with a bit of a sweet finish.<p class=message>Sounds interesting! I'll have to try it out. And what about cocktails?<p class="message sent">We have a few new ones as well. If you're feeling adventurous, try the jalapeno margarita. It's got a nice kick to it!<p class=message>Ooh, I like the sound of that. I might have to give it a shot.<p class="message sent">So what's your favorite thing to grill?<p class=message>Honestly, it's hard to choose just one. But I love a good steak. The customers always seem to enjoy them too.<p class="message sent">I can see why. There's nothing quite like a perfectly grilled steak. And do you have any secret techniques?<p class=message>Well, I like to season mine with a bit of garlic salt and pepper. And I always let it rest for a few minutes after grilling.<p class="message sent">That's a great tip! I'll have to remember that next time I'm grilling at home.<p class=message>Definitely! And you can always experiment with different seasonings too. It's all about finding what works for you.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And I'll keep experimenting with different drink combinations. Cheers to a great night of grilling and drinking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=10019752-666f-4fed-a4ab-0b579c03d25a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
