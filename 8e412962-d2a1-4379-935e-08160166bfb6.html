Here you go.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me just check the system. Hmm, it looks like you've driven quite a bit since you bought the car!<p class=message>Oh wow, really? How much have I accumulated?<p class="message sent">According to our records, you've driven a total of 15,000 miles in the past year.<p class=message>That's not as much as I thought it would be.<p class="message sent">Well, it's still quite a distance, if you think about it! That's the equivalent of driving from New York to Los Angeles and back.<p class=message>That's crazy! I had no idea I had driven that far.<p class="message sent">Yes, cars can be very deceiving. They make you feel like you're not traveling very far when in fact you could be racking up the miles.<p class=message>That's definitely true. But I'm glad to know that my car is holding up well despite all the miles I've put on it.<p class="message sent">Yes, it seems like you've been taking good care of it. Just remember to bring it in for regular maintenance checks.<p class=message>Will do! Thanks for all your help, I appreciate it.<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to assist. Safe driving!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8e406a7c-c7e7-48f7-a356-4f02b67b126a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
