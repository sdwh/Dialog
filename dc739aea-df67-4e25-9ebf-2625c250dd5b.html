I heard you are a game developer. Can you tell me more about the latest racing game you are working on?<p class="message sent">Of course! We are designing a new racing game that's going to blow your mind. It involves using virtual reality headsets to simulate the feeling of driving an actual race car.<p class=message>Wow! That sounds amazing. How many tracks are you planning to include in the game?<p class="message sent">Right now we have around 10 tracks in development, but we are hoping to include more based on player feedback.<p class=message>That's great! Are there any special features that you are including in the game?<p class="message sent">We are including multiplayer mode, where players can compete against their friends online. And we are also adding a customization feature where you can modify your car's appearance and performance.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. When can we expect to see this game?<p class="message sent">We are targeting a release sometime next year. But we want to make sure the game is polished and perfect before we launch it.<p class=message>Is there anything you need from players to make this game even better?<p class="message sent">Definitely! We want as much player feedback as possible. So, once the beta version of the game is released, we would love for players to share their thoughts and suggestions with us.<p class=message>I'm excited to play this game! How about you? Have you tried any other racing games recently?<p class="message sent">Actually, I just played one last night. It was so intense that I got motion sickness. (laughs)<p class=message>(laughs) What game was that?<p class="message sent">It was one of our competitor's games. Don't worry, our game won't make you feel sick.<p class=message>(laughs) I trust you on that. Thanks for sharing all this information with me. I can't wait to try out your new racing game.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dc6f2288-3379-4775-bb51-adb904f8e020.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
