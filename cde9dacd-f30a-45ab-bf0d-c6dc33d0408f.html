I need some legal advice about starting a new business.<p class=message>Of course, I'd be happy to help. What type of business are you starting?<p class="message sent">It's going to be a dog clothing store.<p class=message>That sounds adorable! Have you thought about the legal structure of your business?<p class="message sent">Not really, I'm just getting started.<p class=message>Well, there are a few different options, such as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or limited liability company. We should discuss which one would be best for your situation.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. What about trademarks for my business name and logo?<p class=message>Yes, that's something we should definitely look into. We'll want to make sure no one else is using the same or similar name or logo.<p class="message sent">Okay, that makes sense. What about contracts with suppliers and customers?<p class=message>That's also a very important aspect of your business. We can create contracts that protect your interests and ensure everyone is on the same page.<p class="message sent">Thank you, you've been very helpful so far. What else should I be considering?<p class=message>Well, we can also discuss things like business licenses, permits, and registering with the state.<p class="message sent">Wow, there's so much to think about. I'm glad I came to see you for advice.<p class=message>I'm here to help make the process as smooth as possible. Do you have any other questions for me?<p class="message sent">Not at this moment, but I'm sure I'll be back with more as the process continues.<p class=message>I'll be here when you need me. Good luck with your new venture!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cde7b1dd-7904-48a1-86f7-0aae11a0079f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
