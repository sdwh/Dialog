I am A, your local guide. How are you finding the place, B?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm loving it so far. The scenery is breathtaking.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. This place has an air of magic about it. Do you know the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've read about it. Was this the place where they lived?<p class=message>According to legend, King Arthur's castle was located here. But no one has ever found it. Perhaps you'll be the one to discover it?<p class="message sent">(laughs) I'll do my best.<p class=message>There's much more to explore here. Up ahead is the Sea Cave, one of Avalon's top attractions.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting, can we go there?<p class=message>Sure, we just need to be careful on the rocks. The waves can be quite strong.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to see it. Are there any local foods to try?<p class=message>Yes, of course. If you're brave enough, you can try our famous seafood chowder made with local fish.<p class="message sent">I love seafood, I'll definitely try that.<p class=message>Great! And we also have a special honey mead that's made from local honey.<p class="message sent">Honey mead? Sounds unique. I'll have to give that a try too.<p class=message>Wonderful, I'll take you to a local restaurant where you can enjoy both. Meanwhile, let's enjoy the view from here. (points out to the sea)<p class="message sent">(gasps) Wow, this is truly magical. Thanks for showing me around, A.<p class=message>My pleasure, B. I hope you have a great time here in Avalon.<p class="message sent">I'm sure I will. Let's go see that Sea Cave now!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=45438ed8-4870-462c-ac5e-6e6f2ed6100f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
