My name is Officer Jones. Can you please state your name for the record?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Officer Jones. My name is John.<p class=message>John, we need to talk to you about an incident that occurred last night. Can you tell us where you were between 9-11 pm?<p class="message sent">Oh, sure. I was actually at home watching Netflix with my girlfriend.<p class=message>Okay, and can your girlfriend verify your alibi?<p class="message sent">Yes, she can. Her name is Sarah and she's currently at work, but I can give you her contact information.<p class=message>Great, thank you. Now, John, I need to ask you about your car. We have reason to believe it was involved in a hit-and-run accident.<p class="message sent">My car? No way. I haven't been in an accident. You must have the wrong person.<p class=message>Well, we have eyewitnesses who saw a car matching the description of yours leaving the scene of the accident.<p class="message sent">Oh, wow. That's really surprising. But I promise you, I didn't do it. I'll do whatever it takes to clear my name.<p class=message>I appreciate your cooperation, John. Let's get your girlfriend's contact information and we'll continue the investigation.<p class="message sent">Of course, officer. Anything to help. But can I ask you a question? Is it true that police officers love donuts?<p class=message>(laughs) That's just a stereotype, John. But in all honesty, who doesn't love a good donut once in a while?<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more, officer. Thanks for keeping things light. It's definitely helping to ease my nerves.<p class=message>No problem, John. We're just doing our job. And speaking of donuts, maybe we can grab some after this whole ordeal is over.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! You can never go wrong with a fresh glazed donut.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=76e888ee-9684-480b-bf3d-e9ad04f6d118.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
