How are you today?<p class="message sent">Not so great, Officer. I never imagined being in a detective's office.<p class=message>Well, it's not every day that we invite someone for a chat. But, we're here to discuss the problem that we have with you.<p class="message sent">Okay, I think I know where this is going.<p class=message>It's about the incident at the grocery store, where there was a theft that occurred. Do you happen to know anything about that?<p class="message sent">Oh, that. Nope, I don't have any idea. I was just grabbing some milk and eggs. I'm a good guy.<p class=message>Hmm. We got it all on tape. It appears that you were stuffing bottles into your bag.<p class="message sent">Oh, come on, Officer. I was putting the groceries into my bag. I would never steal anything.<p class=message>That's what they all say. You know, Mr. B, honesty is always the best policy.<p class="message sent">Yeah, you're right. Alright, I took the bottles. You got me.<p class=message>I appreciate your honesty. Why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself while we wait for your paperwork to process?<p class="message sent">Really? Okay, I'm a huge fan of chess and I also have a pet hamster named Jerry.<p class=message>Nice. I used to play chess in college, but never quite got the hang of it. My daughter has a pet bunny named Thumper.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Hey, I love bunnies too. They're so cute.<p class=message>(chuckling) Yeah, I know. So, what do you do for work?<p class="message sent">I'm a freelance writer, mainly for online magazines and blogs. It pays the bills.<p class=message>Interesting. I have a friend who's also into freelance writing. Have you ever thought of writing a book?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'm working on a novel, but it's a slow process. Writer's block, you know.<p class=message>(nodding) Oh yeah, I know what you mean. Well, Mr. B, I hope you learned a lesson from this. I wish you good luck with your writing and the next time you grab some milk and eggs, be sure to pay for them.<p class="message sent">Will do, Officer. And thank you for being so understanding.<p class=message>No problem at all. Have a good day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0e051bc1-0709-4b7a-9b53-db1f6f102378.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
