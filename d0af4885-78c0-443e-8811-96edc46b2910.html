What kind of items are you interested in?<p class="message sent">I'm in the market for some vintage clothing and maybe a record player. Do you have anything like that?<p class=message>Actually, I do happen to have some vintage clothing that I think you'd love. And as luck would have it, I have a great record player for sale too.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! Can you tell me more about the record player?<p class=message>It's a vintage model from the 1960s, but it's been fully restored and sounds amazing. I have it priced at $150, but I'm willing to negotiate.<p class="message sent">That's a bit out of my price range, but I'm definitely interested in the clothing. Can you show me what you have?<p class=message>Of course! I have a great selection of dresses, blouses, and even some accessories. What style are you looking for?<p class="message sent">I'm really into the 70s boho look, anything that fits that style would be perfect.<p class=message>I think you'll love this floral maxi dress, it's very bohemian and perfect for summer. And it's only $40!<p class="message sent">That's a great price, I'll definitely take it. Do you accept Venmo?<p class=message>Yes, I do. I can also hold the record player for you if you change your mind.<p class="message sent">That's very kind of you, but I think I'll stick to just the dress for now. Thanks for your help!<p class=message>No problem at all, enjoy your new dress and have a great day at the market.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d0ad2c6e-ad8d-4289-a5e2-6d789f3c8cdd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
