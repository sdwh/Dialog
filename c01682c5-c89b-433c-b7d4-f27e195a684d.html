Can you help me find a dressing room? I'd like to try on this blouse.<p class="message sent">Sure, right this way. We have a few dressing rooms at the back of the store. Let me know if you need anything else.<p class=message>Thank you so much.<p class=message>I love how this blouse looks on me! But the sleeves are a little too long. Do you have any advice on how to fix that?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me see. You could try rolling them up a bit or cuffing them. Or you could also consider getting them tailored if you really love the blouse.<p class=message>Good ideas! I'll give them a try. Speaking of sleeves, have you seen those ridiculous giant sleeves on some of the fashion runway shows lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! They look like a cross between a puffy cloud and a huge sail. Not exactly practical for everyday wear.<p class=message>Definitely not! It reminds me of a costume from a sci-fi movie. But I guess that's the fun of fashion sometimes - pushing boundaries and trying new things.<p class="message sent">Totally! Fashion is all about creativity and expressing yourself. That's why I love working in this industry.<p class=message>That's so cool. Do you have a favorite fashion trend at the moment?<p class="message sent">I'm really loving bright colors and bold patterns right now. They're so fun and lively. What about you?<p class=message>Same here! I'm all about the neon greens and pinks this season. They really make a statement.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Well, it looks like that blouse is a great fit on you. Do you need anything else or would you like to purchase it?<p class=message>Just this blouse for now, thank you. You've been so helpful.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c0148610-5afc-405e-8b95-4a67f98e0657.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
