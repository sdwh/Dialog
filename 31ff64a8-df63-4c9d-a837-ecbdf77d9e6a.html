I went on a group tour to Europe last summer.<p class=message>Really? How was that? I've been considering a group tour for my next trip.<p class="message sent">It was great! Everything was organized for us, so we didn't need to worry about anything. But you should also consider a solo trip, like a free and easy trip.<p class=message>Hmm, I've never done that before. I feel like I might get lost or run into trouble.<p class="message sent">It's not that hard! You just need to do some research and plan your itinerary beforehand. Plus, you get more freedom to explore at your own pace.<p class=message>That does sound appealing. But I also like the idea of socializing and meeting new people on a group tour.<p class="message sent">That's true. On a group tour, you get to travel with a diverse group of people, and you may even make some friends for life.<p class=message>Do you think group tours are more expensive than free and easy trips?<p class="message sent">It really depends on the destination and the tour package. With group tours, you usually get better deals on accommodations and transportations, but you might have to pay extra for optional activities. For free and easy trips, you have more control over your budget and itinerary, but you'll need to book your own accommodations and transportation.<p class=message>I see. Maybe I'll do a mix of both on my next trip!<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. You could start with a group tour for the first few days, and then switch to a free and easy trip for the rest of the trip.<p class=message>Yeah, that way I'll get the best of both worlds! Thanks for the suggestion!<p class="message sent">No problem! Just make sure to enjoy your trip, no matter what kind of travel style you choose!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=31f74816-f420-408f-9b9e-05c5c7d44d49.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
