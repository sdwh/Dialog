It's a globally recognized standard for information security management.<p class=message>That's right. I'm actually working on implementing it in our company. Do you have any experience with it?<p class="message sent">Not really, but I do know that it's a comprehensive framework designed to keep sensitive information secure.<p class=message>Exactly. The policy covers everything from risk management to incident response plans.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like a lot of work. How are you planning to tackle it?<p class=message>I'm thinking of breaking it down into smaller parts and assigning them to different teams. It'll make the process more manageable.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. How long do you think it will take to implement the policy?<p class=message>It could take around six to eight months. But if we do it right, we'll have a robust security system in place.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's better to take our time and do things properly, rather than rush and make mistakes.<p class=message>Absolutely. We don't want to leave any loopholes in our security. I'm also thinking of conducting regular audits to ensure we're following the policy.<p class="message sent">Yes, audits are crucial. They'll help us identify any weaknesses in our security measures and take corrective action.<p class=message>Right. And we also need to make sure all employees are aware of the policy and trained on how to comply with it.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We can't afford to have anyone accidentally compromise our security. It's better to be safe than sorry.<p class=message>Exactly. And besides, following the policy is not just good for our company, it's also good for our customers who trust us with their sensitive information.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's true. It's important to safeguard their trust and protect their data.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1c0bf74b-8e3e-425b-a666-3ce86d09aad4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
