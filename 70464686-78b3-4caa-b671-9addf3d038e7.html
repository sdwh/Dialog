How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not bad, not bad at all. Just thinking about what to put on the menu this season.<p class=message>Well, I've got some fresh catches from this morning that might tickle your taste buds.<p class="message sent">Ooh, do tell! What have you got?<p class=message>Some succulent lobster and grilled shrimp, as well as some meaty salmon and tuna.<p class="message sent">Sounds absolutely delicious! That'll definitely be a crowd-pleaser.<p class=message>I was also thinking about adding some creative twists to classic dishes like clam chowder and fish and chips.<p class="message sent">Good idea. You know, I was just thinking about maybe adding some unique sushi rolls to the menu too.<p class=message>I was hoping you'd say that! I've got some fresh uni and toro in my boat right now.<p class="message sent">Perfect! Let's definitely include those on the menu.<p class=message>By the way, have you ever tried mixing oysters with bacon and blue cheese?<p class="message sent">Can't say I have, but it sounds like a daring combination. Let's make it happen!<p class=message>Sounds like we've got some great ideas brewing. This season's menu is going to be a hit!<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more.
