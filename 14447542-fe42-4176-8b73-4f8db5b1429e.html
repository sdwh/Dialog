Let's take a look at what we need to do.<p class=message>Well, we've got a few milestones coming up, and I want to make sure we hit them all.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We're right on track so far, but we'll need to stay focused to stay that way.<p class=message>Agreed. I was thinking we could break down the tasks into smaller chunks to make it more manageable.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. We can set up a few mini-deadlines to help us stay organized.<p class=message>Great suggestion. And what about our testing schedule? We'll need to make sure we factor that in as well.<p class="message sent">Right, we'll need to leave enough time for testing so we don't run into any issues later on.<p class=message>Exactly. And speaking of issues, have you run into any roadblocks in your development lately?<p class="message sent">Not really, everything's been running smoothly. Knock on wood!<p class=message>(laughs) Good to hear. Keep up the good work, B.<p class="message sent">Will do, A. And don't forget, we all need breaks too. Let's make sure we give ourselves some breathing room.<p class=message>Definitely. We don't want to burn out before the project is even finished.<p class="message sent">No way. Let's stay refreshed and focused, and we'll get it done in no time.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan, B. Thanks for your input on the schedule. I think we're in good shape.<p class="message sent">No problem, A.
