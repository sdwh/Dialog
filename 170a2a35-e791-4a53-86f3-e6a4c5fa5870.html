I wouldn't want to indulge too much.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll bring it out shortly! Is there anything else I can get for you?<p class=message>No, thank you. The main course was delicious and I'm excited to dig into this lovely bread.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that! Do you have any favourite bread recipes or types of bread?<p class=message>Actually, I've been trying to eat healthier recently so I've been enjoying whole wheat and multigrain breads.<p class="message sent">That's great! We actually have a delicious whole wheat sourdough bread that I think you would really enjoy. Have you ever tried it before?<p class=message>No, I haven't! But that sounds like a great option for me next time I visit.<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely give it a try. And don't forget about our gluten-free bread options as well.<p class=message>Wow, I'm impressed! You really have something for everyone here. Thank you for the recommendation.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. Let me know if you need anything else.
