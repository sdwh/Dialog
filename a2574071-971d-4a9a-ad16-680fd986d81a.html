It sounds like they'll have some great insights on keeping our financial data safe.<p class=message>Definitely. As an infosec engineer, what do you think are the biggest threats to financial security?<p class="message sent">Well, I think we need to be aware of phishing attacks and malware that can steal login information. But we also need to consider insider threats from employees who may have access to sensitive data.<p class=message>That's a good point. As a network security expert, what measures do you think are necessary to protect financial transactions?<p class="message sent">We need to implement strong password policies and encryption, as well as monitoring systems to detect any unauthorized access. And of course, regular security training for employees is essential.<p class=message>Agreed. It's also important to stay up-to-date on the latest security trends and technologies.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We need to be proactive and stay ahead of any potential threats.<p class=message>Well, I feel a bit more secure knowing that there are professionals like you looking out for our financial safety.<p class="message sent">Haha, thanks. It's all part of the job.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a256c7be-dbb1-40cc-9e2a-065dedb2a71a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
