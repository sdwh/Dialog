We're hoping to make it easy for customers to book and check-in online.<p class=message>Great, I've got some experience in designing user-friendly interfaces that could really help us out.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. Our database system is already set up to handle booking and check-in, so we just need a well-designed app to bring it all together.<p class=message>I'll make sure to keep the user experience at the forefront of my design. Are there any specific features you would like included?<p class="message sent">Well, we need to be able to access passenger information easily and make sure it's accurate. And it would be great if we could display flight status and boarding details within the app as well.<p class=message>Absolutely. I might suggest some push notifications to remind passengers to check-in and notify them of any flight delays or changes.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. And maybe we could even allow passengers to pre-order in-flight meals or select their seat through the app.<p class=message>I love it. With these features, we'll make the customer's journey smoother and more enjoyable.<p class="message sent">That's the goal! And with your design skills and our database management, I'm confident we can create an amazing app together.<p class=message>Me too. Let's get to work on this and make it happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b08c8410-6482-4bdc-98a9-21caec26d8e6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
