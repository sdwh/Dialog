Is it working well?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's great. It's got facial recognition technology now, which helps us keep track of who's coming in and out.<p class=message>That's amazing. I remember when we used to check IDs manually - this is definitely a more efficient approach!<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We're also looking into getting smart gates installed soon to further enhance security.<p class=message>Smart gates? That's impressive. How do they work?<p class="message sent">They work by automatically checking if shoppers have any unauthorized items in their bags as they exit. It's a great way to prevent theft.<p class=message>Oh wow, that's really interesting. I'm sure the customers will appreciate that extra step to keep their shopping secure.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Security is a top priority for us, and we're always looking for ways to improve our processes.<p class=message>Well, it sounds like you're doing a great job so far! Is there anything else I can help with?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. It would be helpful if you could keep an eye on the shop floor for any suspicious behaviour while you're on duty.<p class=message>Of course, I'll be sure to do that. Thanks for letting me know.<p class="message sent">No problem. That's all for now - thanks for stopping by to chat!<p class=message>Absolutely! It's always great to see new security measures in place. See you later!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=51e138ce-4481-4b7b-8380-646fc0263518.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
