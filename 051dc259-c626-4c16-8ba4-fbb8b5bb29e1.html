Maybe I'll just use my cat's name again.<p class="message sent message-content">Uh, I don't think that's a good idea.<p class="message received message-content">Why not? She's never forgettable.<p class="message sent message-content">But she's also not very secure. How about we come up with a stronger option together?<p class="message received message-content">Sounds like a plan. Let's make sure the ISO 27001 incident stays a funny anecdote and not a major disaster.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=051d1f32-9428-4f2b-b652-01bf0c651101.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
