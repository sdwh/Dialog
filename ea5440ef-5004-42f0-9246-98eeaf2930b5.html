How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm just passing through the town and thought I'd check out your shop. What do you sell here?<p class=message>We sell a variety of local specialties from Hokkaido, such as milk sweets, seafood, and souvenirs.<p class="message sent">That sounds great, I'm a big fan of seafood. What do you have in stock?<p class=message>Today we have some freshly caught salmon and scallops that just came in this morning.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious! I'll take some of each. What about something sweet to go with it?<p class=message>Our milk sweets are very popular. We have different flavors like matcha, Hokkaido milk, and strawberry.<p class="message sent">I'll go for the Hokkaido milk flavor. And do you have any recommendations for souvenirs?<p class=message>Yes, we have some handmade crafts from local artisans, like pottery and wood carvings. They make great gifts.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I'll grab a few of those for my family back home. Have you lived in this town for a long time?<p class=message>Yes, I've been here my whole life. It's a small community, but we have everything we need.<p class="message sent">It must be nice to be so close to nature. I love the fresh air and scenery up here.<p class=message>Yes, it's very peaceful. Sometimes we have to deal with harsh weather conditions, but it's worth it for the beauty.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. Well, thanks for your help today. I'll definitely be back next time I'm passing through.<p class=message>Thank you for stopping by. Have a safe trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ea52988b-74e0-424f-8232-0341a76cb0b3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
