Are you from Nanjing originally?<p class="message sent">Yes, sir. Born and raised.<p class=message>Oh, great. So, how long have you been driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">17 years, sir. I love driving and meeting new people.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. Have you had any crazy passengers before?<p class="message sent">I have had my fair share, sir.

So, do you have any hobbies outside of work?<p class="message sent">I like to play basketball in my free time. How about you, sir? Do you play any sports?<p class=message>I enjoy swimming and hiking. Do you have any favorite restaurants in Nanjing?<p class="message sent">Yes, sir. I highly recommend trying the duck blood soup and salted duck.
