No, I don't think so. What is it?<p class=message>It's a Vietnamese sandwich. Trust me, once you try it, you won't be able to get enough of it!<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting! What's in it?<p class=message>Oh, lots of things! Usually there's a meat like pork or chicken, pickled vegetables, cilantro, and hot peppers.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds really flavorful! Is it spicy?<p class=message>It can be, but it's not always. You can ask for it to be less spicy if you're not a fan of heat.<p class="message sent">Good to know. Where can I find Banh Mi?<p class=message>There's actually a great place down the street from here. Let's go check it out!<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it! What kind of bread is it served on?<p class=message>It's usually a baguette-style bread, but it's not quite the same as a traditional French baguette. It's a little lighter and airier.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to try it! Are there any other variations of Banh Mi?<p class=message>Yes, there are different versions from different regions in Vietnam. Some have grilled pork, some have pâté, and some even have sausage.<p class="message sent">Sounds like there's a lot to explore! Do they serve Banh Mi with any sides or drinks?<p class=message>Typically they serve it with an iced Vietnamese coffee. It's a strong coffee with sweetened condensed milk - the perfect balance to the savory Banh Mi.<p class="message sent">Yum! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2187c442-3c98-4b01-af09-f897e4be4f78.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
