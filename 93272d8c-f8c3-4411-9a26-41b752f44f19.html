My name is A and I'll be your barista. What can I get you today?<p class="message sent">Hi A, my name is B and I'm actually a roaster. I'm here to learn more about Spanish coffee.<p class=message>That's great! Spanish coffee is fantastic. What would you like to know?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, what exactly makes Spanish coffee unique?<p class=message>Spanish coffee is known for being very strong and often served in small portions. We use dark roasted espresso beans and add just a touch of sugar to offset the bitterness.<p class="message sent">Interesting. Can you show me how you make it?<p class=message>Of course! Let me show you how to make a classic Spanish espresso.<p class="message sent">Wow, that was amazing. I'm definitely going to have to try that at my roastery.<p class=message>I'm glad you enjoyed it! Do you have any tips for me on how to improve my coffee-making skills?<p class="message sent">Actually, I think your technique is spot on. Your coffee is delicious.<p class=message>Thank you! That means a lot coming from a professional roaster.<p class="message sent">No problem. It's always fun to learn from each other.<p class=message>Absolutely. Say, do you have any favorite coffee recommendations for me to try?<p class="message sent">Definitely. There's a great coffee shop just down the street that uses sustainably sourced beans. You should check it out.<p class=message>Thanks for the tip, I'll be sure to check it out.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. It's been great chatting with you, A.<p class=message>Likewise, B.
