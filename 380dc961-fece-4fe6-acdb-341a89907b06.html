How about yours?<p class=message>Not bad. I'm on my way to Atlanta for a fun weekend. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, plenty of times. What are your plans for the weekend?<p class=message>I'm going to visit the Georgia Aquarium and attend a Braves baseball game. How about you? Any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Just work, unfortunately. But I love Atlanta, so it's not so bad.<p class=message>What do you like about Atlanta?<p class="message sent">The weather is great, the people are friendly, and there's always something to do. Plus, the food is amazing.<p class=message>Speaking of food, do you have any restaurant recommendations?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. If you like barbecue, you can't go wrong with Fox Bros. And if you're in the mood for some soul food, hit up Mary Mac's Tea Room.<p class=message>Thanks for the tips. What's the craziest thing that's ever happened to you while driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">Oh man, where do I start? I've had passengers try to pay me in waffles, get into arguments with their significant others, and even fall asleep and miss their flight. It's never a dull day in the taxi business.<p class=message>Ha! I can only imagine. Have you ever had any celebrity passengers?<p class="message sent">I once drove Tyler Perry around town. He was super cool and down-to-earth.<p class=message>No way, that's awesome. Well, we're almost at the airport now. Thanks for the great conversation and safe driving!<p class="message sent">No problem, enjoy your weekend in Atlanta!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=38063d5b-0245-417d-99ba-f5c33963ea93.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
