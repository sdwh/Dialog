Thanks for coming by again to help with the livestock transportation.<p class="message sent">No problem, A! Always happy to lend a hand. So, what’s on the itinerary today?<p class=message>Well, we have a few cows and sheep scheduled for transport to the nearby auction. And we have a few potential buyers interested in purchasing our pigs.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a full day. But we got this!<p class=message>Indeed! But before we head out, I wanted to show you a new toy I just bought for the animals. It’s this automated brush-machine. They seem to love getting their backs brushed by it.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That’s hilarious! I’ve never seen anything like it.<p class=message>Yeah, well, happy cows make for healthier and tastier meat, right?<p class="message sent">I couldn’t agree more. Speaking of tasty meat, have you tried out that new steakhouse in town?<p class=message>Not yet! But I’ve heard good things. Shall we try it out for lunch?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And maybe we can pitch our pigs to them as well.<p class=message>You never know. Our pigs might be the star on their menu.<p class="message sent">(laughs) As long as they’re happy pigs until then.<p class=message>(smiles) You’re right, B. Happy animals make for happy customers.<p class="message sent">That’s the spirit. Now, let’s load up these friendly critters and make our way to both the auction and that delicious steakhouse.<p class=message>(smiling) Sounds like a plan. Let’s go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3c99649b-0b13-4c8d-84d3-a85899ae56b0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
