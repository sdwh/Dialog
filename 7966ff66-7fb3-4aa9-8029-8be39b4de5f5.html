This beach is such a great spot for brainstorming. I've got an idea for a novel and I'd like to get your thoughts on it.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! What's your idea?<p class=message>Well, it's about a group of stranded tourists on a deserted island who are forced to work together to survive.<p class="message sent">That's a classic plotline but it still has potential. What's the twist?<p class=message>The twist is that one of the stranded tourists is a famous actor who's been living a double life. His true identity is revealed as the story progresses.<p class="message sent">Interesting! Do you have any other characters in mind?<p class=message>Yes, there's a young couple who are on the brink of a breakup and being stranded tests their relationship. And there's also an elderly woman who becomes the moral compass of the group.<p class="message sent">This all sounds great! So what are you thinking for the title?<p class=message>"Castaways and Controversies"?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a bit too serious. How about "Survival of the Silliest"?<p class=message>(laughs) I love it! That's perfect.<p class="message sent">Great, let's talk about your timeline for completing the novel.<p class=message>I'm aiming for 6 months to have a first draft ready.<p class="message sent">That sounds reasonable. Let's get to work then!<p class=message>Absolutely. (sips on a frozen margarita) You know what, B? I think the beach is working its magic on my creativity.<p class="message sent">(also sips on a drink) I hear ya, A. Who says work can't be fun, right?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=796587d7-7b4a-4ecd-976f-1a0934752c33.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
