Just delivering some orders. What about you?<p class=message>I'm managing the restaurant, as usual. But let me tell you, it's been a busy day.<p class="message sent">I can only imagine. I've been hopping all around Incheon and back. But it's good exercise, at least.<p class=message>Definitely. So, what's the craziest delivery you've ever had to make?<p class="message sent">Probably the time I had to deliver ten pizzas to the top of a mountain. I felt like a Sherpa!<p class=message>(laughs) That sounds crazy. Did they tip you well?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it wasn't too bad. But I definitely could have used a climbing harness.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, we'll have to get you one. But for now, let's focus on these orders.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I'm always up for a little adventure though.<p class=message>Oh, I can tell. You're like the Indiana Jones of delivery people.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I'll take that as a compliment. Hey, if anything exciting comes up, you know who to call.<p class=message>Absolutely. And I'll make sure to have a big tip waiting for you too!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Now you're speaking my language. Alright, time to hit the road again. See you later, A.<p class=message>Take care, B.
