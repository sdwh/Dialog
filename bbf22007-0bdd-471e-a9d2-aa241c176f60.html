My name is Alex and I'll be your diving instructor today. Have you ever been diving before?<p class="message sent">Hi Alex, thanks for having me! I have tried diving once, but it was in a pool. This is my first time in the ocean.<p class=message>No problem at all. We'll go over some basics before we go in the water. Do you have any concerns or questions?<p class="message sent">I'm a bit nervous about the depth and the creatures in the sea. Are there any dangerous ones I should watch out for?<p class=message>Don't worry too much. We'll start at a shallow depth and I'll be with you the whole time. As for the creatures, most of them are harmless and they won't bother you. Just stay calm and enjoy the sights!<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds good. How deep will we be going?<p class=message>We'll start at around 10 feet and gradually go a bit deeper than that. But don't worry, we won't go deeper than 40 feet.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's still pretty deep! What kind of marine life can we expect to see down there?<p class=message>You can see lots of things, like colorful fishes, corals, and sea turtles. And if we're lucky, we might even see a shark or a manta ray!<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! I can't wait to see all the beautiful creatures. Let's get started!<p class=message>Alright, let's gear up and get in the water. Remember, take slow and deep breaths and equalize your ears if you feel any discomfort. And most importantly, have fun!<p class="message sent">Got it! Thanks a lot for being such a helpful instructor. Let's go explore the ocean!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bbf1d370-2994-41c3-b62c-ccca6734cd72.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
