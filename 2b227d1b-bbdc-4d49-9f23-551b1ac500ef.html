My name is Alex, and I'll be your real estate agent today. Is there anything you're particularly looking for in a property?<p class="message sent">Thanks, Alex. We're hoping to find something with a little character and personality, but that's also practical for our family. Do you think you might have anything like that?<p class=message>Absolutely. This property is perfect for that. It has a modern interior with a unique layout, and lots of features that add extra charm.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Can you show us around?<p class=message>Sure thing. Let's start with the living room. Check out those large bay windows - they let in so much natural light.<p class="message sent">Wow, you're right. And that brick feature wall is really cool too.<p class=message>Thanks. You'll notice that the kitchen is also updated and comes with brand new appliances. Perfect for family dinner parties.<p class="message sent">It looks stunning. And what about the bedrooms?<p class=message>There are three upstairs, and each one is spacious and bright. Plus, the master has a beautiful en-suite.<p class="message sent">Amazing. And what's the garden like?<p class=message>Oh, it's lovely. It's west-facing, so you get plenty of sun throughout the day. There's also a patio area perfect for outdoor dining and entertaining.<p class="message sent">It's all so perfect - it's like our dream home. Thank you for showing us around, Alex.<p class=message>You're welcome. I'm glad you like it. Shall we talk more about the details and financing options?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2b20be37-ed7e-4cf1-ae2a-7d8ee194b3f4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
