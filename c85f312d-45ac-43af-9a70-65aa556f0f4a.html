We have a wide variety of tea leaves to choose from, what kind of tea are you looking for?<p class=message>I'm in the mood for a light flavored tea that has a little bit of bitter taste. Do you have something like that?<p class="message sent">I have just the tea for you. It's a homegrown Darjeeling tea, that has a subtle floral and a slightly astringent taste. You'd love it.<p class=message>Great, I will take that. Can we also have it roasted a little bit? I prefer my tea a little roasted.<p class="message sent">Of course, it's always nice to cater to our customer's preferences. Have you tried our signature roasted tea blend? It's a mix of rooibos, green tea, and chamomile.<p class=message>No, I haven't. Can you let me have a taste?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Here, have a sip. It's the perfect balance of flavors, and the roasting process gives it a rich and nutty taste.<p class=message>Wow, this is amazing. Our customers would definitely love this kind of tea, can we get a few packets to sell in our store?<p class="message sent">Definitely, we could even make a special blend just for your store. Would you like that?<p class=message>That's a great idea. I'm glad I came to your shop, the quality of your tea is unmatched.<p class="message sent">Thank you, It's always a pleasure when our customers are satisfied. Let me pack up these tea leaves for you.<p class=message>Thank you so much. I can't wait to share this tea with my customers.<p class="message sent">It was a pleasure working with you. Let's keep in touch and create more amazing tea blends.<p class=message>Absolutely. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You too, bye-bye!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c85b284f-e484-40a4-ac33-c5ae9e371211.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
