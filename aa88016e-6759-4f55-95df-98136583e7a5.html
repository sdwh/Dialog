It's great to finally meet you in person, B.<p class="message sent">Hi, it's nice to meet you too. Thanks for having me today.<p class=message>So, let's start with the basics. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and what you do?<p class="message sent">Sure! I work as a professional skydiver and stuntman for movies and TV shows.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds exciting! I'm sure our readers would love to know more about your job. Can you tell us about a challenging project you've worked on?<p class="message sent">Definitely, the most challenging project was when I had to jump from a helicopter at 10,000 feet above ground level for a thriller movie. It was pretty intense!<p class=message>That must have been nerve-wracking. What goes through your mind during those moments?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I try not to think about anything and just focus on the task. It's all about trusting your training at that point.<p class=message>That's really fascinating. So, what do you enjoy doing in your free time?<p class="message sent">I love playing sports, particularly basketball and soccer. I also like to read and watch movies.<p class=message>Great hobbies! Speaking of movies, do you have a favorite action movie or stunt sequence?<p class="message sent">Yes, my favorite action movie is Mission Impossible and my favorite stunt sequence is from The Dark Knight where the Joker blows up the hospital.<p class=message>Both great choices! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. It was truly a pleasure.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me. It was a pleasure to share my experiences with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aa845b99-74f9-4a2e-97e2-b93186fbd75a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
