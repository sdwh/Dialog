Thanks for picking me up. I need to get to the airport to catch a flight to Shanghai.<p class="message sent">No problem at all! It's a pleasure to help. How long are you staying in Shanghai for?<p class=message>Just a couple of days. My company has a conference there.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds exciting. Have you been to China before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time. But I've heard so much about Shanghai. I'm looking forward to exploring the city.<p class="message sent">Shanghai is a beautiful city. You'll have a great time. Do you know any Mandarin?<p class=message>Just a few basic phrases, like "Ni hao" and "Xie xie". But I'm hoping to learn more while I'm there.<p class="message sent">That's a great start! I'm sure you'll pick up more as you go along. So, what do you do for work?<p class=message>I work in marketing. And you, what do you do for a living?<p class="message sent">I'm a taxi driver, as you can see! (laughs) But seriously, I enjoy talking to people from all walks of life. It's always interesting to learn about different professions.<p class=message>I agree. It's one of the reasons I love traveling for work. You meet so many different people and learn so much.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of learning, if you have any questions about Shanghai, feel free to ask me. I've been driving in this city for over a decade.<p class=message>That's really helpful. I appreciate it! So, what's your favorite thing about Shanghai?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough one. I'd have to say the food, hands down. Shanghai cuisine is amazing. Have you tried xiaolongbao?<p class=message>No, what's that?<p class="message sent">It's a type of steamed bun with soup and meat inside. It's a local specialty. You HAVE to try it while you're here.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll definitely look for it. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem. And we're here! You have a great trip, and enjoy Shanghai!<p class=message>Thanks so much. It was great talking to you!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d5c301be-869d-4355-9a62-c0e671f7239d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
