How are you enjoying your stay here in Fukuoka?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's been amazing so far. This city has such a rich culinary scene and I'm excited to learn more about it.<p class=message>That's great to hear! You must be excited to learn about our famous Hakata ramen and seafood dishes.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm especially interested in learning how to grill fish Japanese-style.<p class=message>Ah, you're in luck. We're known for having some of the freshest seafood in Japan. What type of fish do you want to learn how to grill?<p class="message sent">I would love to learn how to grill saba, or mackerel. I've heard it's a popular fish for grilling in Fukuoka.<p class=message>It certainly is. We have a special marinade we use for it. I'll show you how to prepare it and then we can grill it up together!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I can't wait to try it.<p class=message>You'll love it, trust me. Have you tried any other Fukuoka dishes yet?<p class="message sent">I had tonkatsu ramen for the first time and it was amazing! The broth was so flavorful and the noodles were perfectly cooked.<p class=message>Yes, tonkatsu ramen is a must-try while you're here. Another dish you should try is mentaiko, spicy cod roe. It's a Fukuoka specialty.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely keep that in mind. Thanks for all the recommendations, A. This trip has been such an eye-opener for me.<p class=message>No problem, B. It's always great to share our local cuisine with visitors. And who knows? Maybe one day you'll open your own Japanese restaurant back home.<p class="message sent">Haha who knows? Maybe I'll even add a Fukuoka-inspired dish to the menu.<p class=message>That would be amazing! Let's start with mastering this mackerel dish first though, shall we?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=709d2f9b-9224-444a-9625-99259c7b3e01.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
