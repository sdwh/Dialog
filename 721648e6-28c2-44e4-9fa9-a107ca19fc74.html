Are you excited about the scenic drive?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! The view from up here is breathtaking!<p class=message>Oh, I know! The bridge is an engineering feat and provides a great view of the city. Do you know how long it is?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not sure. How long is it?<p class=message>Well, it's about 1.7 miles long! Can you believe that?<p class="message sent">Wow, that's incredible! How long did it take to build?<p class=message>It took about four years to build and was completed in 1937. That's almost 84 years ago!<p class="message sent">That's amazing! Speaking of amazing, have you ever driven across the bridge during the fog?<p class=message>Yes, I remember driving across the bridge during the fog one time. It was really eerie, like driving in a dream.<p class="message sent">That sounds really cool! I hope I get to experience that too sometime.<p class=message>Well, I hope you do too! Speaking of experiences, have you been to any other landmarks in San Francisco?<p class="message sent">Yes, I went to Alcatraz Island just yesterday. Have you been there before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. The prison is really fascinating, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it truly is! It was like stepping back in time.<p class=message>Absolutely. Well, we're almost at the other side of the bridge. I hope you enjoyed the drive and the view!<p class="message sent">I did! Thank you for being such a great driver and tour guide.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7214caf1-939c-452b-86c8-578afd527859.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
