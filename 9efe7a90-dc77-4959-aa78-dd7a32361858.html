What brings you to this meeting?<p class="message sent">I'm a data engineer, and I hear there's a lot of data integration work that needs to be done in this bank. I'm here to help.<p class=message>That's great. I've been running into problems with data quality lately. It's been affecting our ability to understand our customers.<p class="message sent">Oh, I feel your pain. I once worked on a project where we found out that 20% of the data was duplicates. We were seeing double!<p class=message>Haha, that must have been a headache to handle. But seriously, we need a good understanding of our customers. What do you suggest we do?<p class="message sent">Well, I think we need to streamline our data sources and make sure everything is up-to-date. And we should also look into machine learning algorithms to help us get better insights.<p class=message>Yes, that sounds like a good idea. But let's not forget about the human touch. We also need to talk to our customers and understand their needs.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I've been working on a sentiment analysis project with social media data that could help us understand how people are feeling about the bank.<p class=message>Wow, that's really interesting. It sounds like we have a lot of work to do, but I'm excited to get started on this project.<p class="message sent">Me too. And hey, if we get stuck, we can always grab some coffee and brainstorm some more.<p class=message>Haha, yes. That's always a good idea. Alright then, let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9eecd653-dd19-4415-9d8f-c110c2b73b9a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
