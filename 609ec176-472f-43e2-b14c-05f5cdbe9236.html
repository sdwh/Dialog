Can you give me an update on the project progress?<p class="message sent">Sure. We've finished the research phase and we're currently working on the design phase. It's going smoothly so far.<p class=message>That sounds good. Do you anticipate any problems in the upcoming stages?<p class="message sent">We might encounter some issues during the testing phase, but we have a contingency plan in place to address it.<p class=message>Excellent. By the way, have you seen the updated timeline for the project?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It looks great.

I'll mention it to the organizing committee. Thanks for your input.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. Looking forward to it.
