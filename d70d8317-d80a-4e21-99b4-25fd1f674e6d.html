But it sounds interesting, what's in it?<p class=message>Oh, it's a mix of pumpkin puree, cinnamon, nutmeg, and steamed milk topped with whipped cream and caramel drizzle. It's perfect for the fall season!<p class="message sent">Wow, that does sound tempting. Maybe I'll give it a try during my break. By the way, did you hear about the new customer who came in this morning?<p class=message>Oh no, what happened?<p class="message sent">Nothing bad, actually. He was dressed in a full cowboy outfit, hat and all. He ordered a double espresso and said he needed it to "cowboy up" for the day ahead.<p class=message>Haha, that's hilarious! We do get some interesting characters in here.<p class="message sent">Speaking of characters, do you remember that customer who always insisted on ordering a cappuccino with extra foam?<p class=message>Oh yeah, the foam guy! He would never be satisfied unless his drink had an inch of foam on top.<p class="message sent">Exactly! He even brought in his own ruler to measure it one time.<p class=message>(laughing) Some people sure do take their coffee seriously, don't they?<p class="message sent">It's all part of the job, though. We're here to serve and make their day a little brighter. And speaking of that, there's a long line forming at the counter. I better get back to work.<p class=message>Same here, time to brew some more coffee. See you later, B!<p class="message sent">Catch you later, A! Don't forget a smile with every cup.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d70b12c2-9bf4-44a9-89d7-5b3ad95a13b1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
