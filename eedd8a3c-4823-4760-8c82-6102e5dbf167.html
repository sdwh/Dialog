How's it going today?<p class="message sent">Great, thank you for asking, A. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, too. I was just reviewing today's menu, and I noticed our special of the day is fish and chips.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's one of our best sellers. Do you have any suggestions on how we can make it even better?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking we could try using a different type of fish, like haddock or cod, and maybe add some lemon zest to the batter for an extra zing. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea! I'm sure our customers will love it. And while we're on the topic of specials, have you thought of any new ideas for next month's menu?<p class=message>Actually, I have. How about a grilled shrimp with mango salsa dish? It's light and refreshing, perfect for the summer season.<p class="message sent">I like it. Let's test it out with our staff and see how it turns out before we add it to the menu. Speaking of staff, how's the new dishwasher working out?<p class=message>He's doing great! He's been very efficient and reliable. And the kitchen staff has been training him on other tasks, like peeling potatoes and prepping vegetables.<p class="message sent">Excellent! I'm glad to hear he's fitting in well. And what about our regular customers? Have you noticed any changes in their needs or preferences?<p class=message>Actually, quite a few customers have been asking about vegetarian and vegan options. Maybe we could add a few more to the menu.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a good point. Let's research some recipes and see what we can come up with. Well, A, thanks for the updates. It seems like everything is running smoothly. Keep up the good work!<p class=message>Thank you, Mr. B. I'm always happy to help out and make our customers happy. Have a great afternoon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eed6ebca-690e-4e50-b875-bf56037573a5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
