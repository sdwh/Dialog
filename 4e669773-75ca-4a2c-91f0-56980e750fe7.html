How's business going for you today at the fruit stand?<p class="message sent">Good to see you, A! Business is going pretty well today. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. People can't resist the smell of freshly made pancakes!<p class="message sent">I know, right? Speaking of which, have you tried putting some of my fresh fruit on your pancakes? It's a delicious combo.<p class=message>Actually, I haven't! But, that sounds like a great idea. Which fruit do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Well, my personal favorites are mangoes and kiwis. They add a nice tangy sweetness to the pancakes.<p class=message>Wow, that does sound delicious! I'll definitely have to try that out sometime.<p class="message sent">And in return, I'll give your customers a special discount on my fruit platters if they purchase your pancakes.<p class=message>That's a great idea, B! We could really help each other out and offer customers the best of both worlds.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And hey, maybe we could even collaborate on other dishes in the future.<p class=message>I like where your head's at, B! Maybe we can come up with our own specialty dish for Yaowarat.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, A! Let's keep up the teamwork and keep our customers happy.<p class=message>Agreed, B!
