Do you have a minute to talk about our new book?<p class="message sent">Of course, A! I'm excited to hear about it! What's the book about?<p class=message>It's a mystery novel set in a small town. There's a murder, a detective, and a lot of twists and turns.<p class="message sent">Sounds intriguing! Who's the intended audience for this book?<p class=message>I think it will appeal to anyone who loves a good mystery. It's not too dark or serious, and there's a bit of humor scattered throughout.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good approach. Have you thought about the cover art yet?<p class=message>Yes, I've been working with a designer to come up with something eye-catching. We're thinking of using a vintage-style illustration.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I think that will help the book stand out on the shelves. What's the title?<p class=message>"Murder in the Mayberry." It's a bit cheesy, but I think it fits the tone of the book.<p class="message sent">I like it! Speaking of cheese, have you thought about doing any book signings or events to promote it?<p class=message>Absolutely! I've got a few local bookstores in mind, and I'm planning on reaching out to some libraries as well.<p class="message sent">Excellent! And once it's published, we'll make sure to send out some review copies to get the buzz going.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Thanks for all your help, B.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. It was great talking about the book, and I can't wait to see it in print!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2cbda30c-639b-48e3-be9a-cd85ce198580.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
