Are you ready for a tour of the beautiful Avalon Peninsula?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Yes, I'm so excited to explore this area. I've heard great things about it.<p class=message>Great! Our first stop is the famous "Elf Door Trail." It's a must-visit destination here.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. I've never seen a trail named after elves before.<p class=message>Yes, the story behind it is that the elves use magical doors to go in and out of our world. People leave gifts for them along the trail, too.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's really cool! Do we get to leave a gift too?<p class=message>Of course! It's an optional tradition, but many people like to leave little trinkets or drawings for the elves.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely bring something to leave for them. What's next on our itinerary?<p class=message>Next, we'll head to the Cape Race lighthouse. It's a historic site that was crucial for communication during the Titanic disaster.<p class="message sent">That's really interesting. How far away is it?<p class=message>It's about a 45-minute drive from here, but the views on the way are breathtaking.<p class="message sent">I have my camera ready to capture all the scenic views.<p class=message>That's great! After the lighthouse, we can stop at a local fish and chips spot for lunch.<p class="message sent">Perfect! I've been craving Newfoundland fish and chips ever since I arrived.<p class=message>You won't be disappointed. The fish is caught fresh and cooked to perfection.<p class="message sent">I can't wait. This tour is already shaping up to be amazing.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear it. We still have a lot more to see and do, so buckle up and let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=85d52a74-ebaa-4078-98b6-48f591436321.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
