But I don't know much about the process.<p class=message>Well, it's not too complicated. You just have to pass the English proficiency test and meet certain requirements.<p class="message sent">That doesn't sound too bad. What kind of requirements?<p class=message>Things like having a certain level of education, work experience, and good health.<p class="message sent">Okay, I think I can meet those standards. But what about living expenses?<p class=message>Australia can be expensive, but it's also a great place to work and live. Living expenses can be offset by higher wages.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's true. But what about the culture shock?<p class=message>Well, you'll need to get used to some differences. For example, Australians drive on the left side of the road.<p class="message sent">Ah, that would take some getting used to. What about the weather?<p class=message>It's really hot in the summers, but it can also get pretty cold in the winters, depending on where you live.<p class="message sent">I see. Do you know anything about the job market there?<p class=message>Yes, it's very competitive. But if you have skills that are in demand, you'll have a better chance of finding work.<p class="message sent">Gotcha. How about the cost of living? Is it expensive?<p class=message>Somewhat, but there are ways to live frugally. Rent can be pricey, but sharing an apartment or house is a cost-effective alternative.<p class="message sent">Good to know. I think I'm going to look into this more seriously.<p class=message>Yeah, you should definitely do some research. It's a beautiful country with friendly people, and it's definitely worth considering.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3315da8f-6d72-4507-ad43-9310be0ec7dc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
