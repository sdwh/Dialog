Let's start today's lesson by discussing a funny experience you had during the break.<p class="message sent">Well, I was trying to get a snack from a vending machine, but my money kept getting rejected.<p class=message>Oh no! That's frustrating. What did you do?<p class="message sent">I tried tilting the machine, and suddenly, a bag of chips came out!<p class=message>(laughs) You're quite resourceful! I hope you didn't damage the machine too much.<p class="message sent">No, it was fine. And the chips tasted great!<p class=message>Speaking of snacks, did you know that one of the earliest vending machines dispensed holy water in temples?<p class="message sent">Really? That's fascinating! I guess vending machines have been around for a lot longer than I thought.<p class=message>Yes, and they've come a long way since then. Nowadays, you can find them selling everything from pizza to electronics!<p class="message sent">It's amazing how much technology has advanced. Who knows what else they'll be able to do in the future.<p class=message>That's a good point. Maybe one day, they'll even be able to predict what snack you're craving!<p class="message sent">(laughs) That would be pretty cool. For now, I'll just stick to my trusty bag of chips.<p class=message>(smiling) Sounds like a plan.
