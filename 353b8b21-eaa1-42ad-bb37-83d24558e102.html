How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thanks. I'm excited to get this coffee shop up and running.<p class=message>Me too! I've been working on perfecting our espresso and latte recipes. Have you seen the new menu I designed?<p class="message sent">Yes, it looks great! I especially like the creative names you came up with for the specialty drinks.<p class=message>Thank you! I wanted our menu to stand out and be fun. And speaking of fun, have you thought about any events or promotions we could do to get people excited about our shop?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. How about a latte art competition? We could invite other baristas to participate and have a prize for the best design.<p class=message>I love it! We could also have a trivia night with coffee-related questions, or even a coffee cupping event to teach people about different roasts and flavors.<p class="message sent">Those are all fantastic ideas. And don't forget about our house-made pastries and sandwiches. Have you tried the quiche I made?<p class=message>Yes, it's delicious! I think our customers are going to love the savory options we have to offer along with our coffee.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We want to create an atmosphere where people can come for a quality cup of coffee and stay for the cozy environment and delicious food.<p class=message>And just wait until we start incorporating seasonal flavors into our drinks and pastries. Our fall pumpkin spice latte is going to be a hit!<p class="message sent">Haha, I can't wait to see the reaction when we announce our seasonal menu. This is going to be a great adventure.<p class=message>Yes it is! Let's work hard and show the people of Lucerne what a great coffee shop we have.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3536a655-71cb-4da3-a840-a08135ab0d62.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
