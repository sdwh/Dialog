How are you today?<p class="message sent">Hello! I'm doing pretty well. What about you?<p class=message>I'm great. I'm excited to be here serving up some delicious pastries.<p class="message sent">And I'm excited to be brewing some amazing coffee to go with them.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds heavenly. What type of coffee do you recommend adding to the chocolate croissants?<p class="message sent">I would suggest our dark roast. It has a rich and bold flavor that should complement the chocolate perfectly.<p class=message>Excellent. I will definitely recommend it to my customers. Speaking of which, have you tried any of my treats yet?<p class="message sent">Actually, I just tried the lemon tart, and it was fantastic. The ratio of tartness and sweetness was perfect.<p class=message>I'm glad you liked it. The lemon tart is one of our best sellers. But have you also tried our macarons?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. Which flavors do you have?<p class=message>We have rose and pistachio flavors today. Both are delicate and flavorful.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'll have to try one of each.<p class=message>That's a great choice. And if you're feeling adventurous, you may want to try our savory options like the quiche or the spinach and feta turnover.<p class="message sent">I've been eyeing those. Maybe I'll grab one for my lunch break.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Can't have you running on an empty stomach all day!<p class="message sent">Ha! I appreciate that. You know, we make a great team. Delicious pastries and excellent coffee - who could ask for more?<p class=message>Absolutely. We're lucky to work in such a great place. It's a pleasure serving our customers together.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Now, let's keep this line moving - lots of hungry and thirsty people to serve today!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7ebb1725-da81-41e1-83b2-d7a9e1a735ad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
