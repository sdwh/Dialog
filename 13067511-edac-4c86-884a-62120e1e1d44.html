Thank you for joining us today for this press conference.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, A. It's always a pleasure to talk to the media.<p class=message>So, let's talk politics. What are your thoughts about the latest issues regarding international trade?<p class="message sent">Well, as you know, the global market is very dynamic and constantly changing. It's important for us to keep up with the trends.<p class=message>Speaking of trends, I heard that you recently started using social media. How's that going for you?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yes, I did. It's been quite an experience! I'm still getting used to the hashtags and emojis, but I'm enjoying the interaction with my followers.<p class=message>That's interesting. Do you have any favorite hashtags?<p class="message sent">Not really, but my assistant insists that I use #politics, #governance, and #leadership in all my tweets.<p class=message>(chuckles) I see. Well, it's good to see politicians embracing technology.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's necessary for us to adapt to the changing times. We need to be accessible to the people we serve.<p class=message>Absolutely. Now, let's have a fun question to end our interview. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?<p class="message sent">(smiling) Hmm, that's a tricky one. I would choose the power of teleportation. It would save me a lot of time commuting between meetings and events.<p class=message>(laughs) That's an excellent choice, Mr. Politician. Thank you for your time today, and we wish you all the best in your political endeavors.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It's been a pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=13009428-c873-4937-98be-95441ade1b86.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
