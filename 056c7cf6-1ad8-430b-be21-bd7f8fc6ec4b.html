How long have you been a taxi driver here in Perth?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Madame! I've been driving for almost ten years now. I've seen a lot of changes in this city!<p class=message>Really? What's the biggest change you've noticed?<p class="message sent">In my opinion, it's the increase in traffic. It seems like every year there are more cars on the road!<p class=message>Yeah, I can see that. It's pretty busy out here. So, have you always lived in Perth?<p class="message sent">No, I was born and raised in London. I moved here when I was in my twenties and I've been here ever since.<p class=message>That's quite a change! Do you miss London?<p class="message sent">Not really. Perth is a great place to live. The weather is always perfect and there's plenty to do.<p class=message>I'm looking forward to exploring the city. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out Kings Park. It's one of the biggest parks in the world and the views of the city are amazing.<p class=message>Sounds great. I'll have to add that to my list. What do you like to do in your free time?<p class="message sent">I like to do a bit of fishing. We have some great spots here in Perth.<p class=message>I've never been fishing before. Maybe I should give it a try while I'm here.<p class="message sent">You should! It's a great way to relax and enjoy the outdoors.<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestion! We're almost at my hotel. What's the fare?<p class="message sent">That'll be $60.<p class=message>Here you go. Keep the change.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Madame. Have a great time in Perth!<p class=message>Thanks, I will!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=056b90d8-87da-4c29-976d-723515ca5679.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
