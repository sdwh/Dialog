Welcome to our bar, how may I help you tonight?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm the mixologist for tonight. We have a special request from one of our guests for a presidential inspired cocktail.<p class=message>Interesting! May I ask which president inspired this cocktail?<p class="message sent">The guest requested for a blend inspired by JFK's favorite cocktail, the daiquiri. We're going to add a bit of twist to make it unique.<p class=message>Sounds exciting! I can't wait to try it. Do you mind telling me how you're planning to make it?<p class="message sent">Of course! For this, we're going to use white rum, fresh lime juice, simple syrup and top it off with a splash of cranberry juice garnished with a lime wheel. The cranberry juice gives it a nice pink hue, perfect for ladies night.<p class=message>That sounds impressive! I'm sure it will be a crowd favorite. How long have you been in this industry?<p class="message sent">I've been mixing drinks for 8 years now. I love experimenting with different flavors and ingredients to create something unique every time.<p class=message>It definitely shows in your drinks. By the way, have you ever had any mishaps while making a drink?<p class="message sent">One time, I made a margarita for a guest and accidentally added pepper instead of salt to the rim. Needless to say, that guest was not very happy.<p class=message>Oh no! That could have been disastrous. But mistakes happen, right? Do you have any advice for someone wanting to become a mixologist?<p class="message sent">My advice would be to always experiment and try new things. Don't be afraid to mix unusual ingredients together because you never know what might work. It's all about finding the perfect balance for your drinks.<p class=message>That's great advice. Thank you for the insight. I can see that your passion is reflected in your work. Keep it up and cheers for tonight!<p class="message sent">Thank you! Cheers to you too and have a great evening serving our customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e647ce0f-daf3-4a7c-ad72-6cec8bf0a3a7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
