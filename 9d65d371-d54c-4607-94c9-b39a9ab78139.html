Can I see your driver's license and registration, please?<p class="message sent">Of course. Here you go, officer.<p class=message>Thank you, Mr. Smith. Can you tell me why you were driving above the speed limit back there?<p class="message sent">Oh, sorry about that. I was just trying to make it to my daughter's soccer game on time.<p class=message>I understand, but speeding is not the solution. You could cause an accident or hurt someone.<p class="message sent">Yes, officer. You are absolutely right. It won't happen again.<p class=message>Okay. I'm going to issue a citation for speeding, but before I do that, can you tell me what you do for a living?<p class="message sent">I'm a delivery truck driver.<p class=message>That's interesting. You must drive a lot on the highways.<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. It can be tiring, but I enjoy seeing different places and meeting new people.<p class=message>That sounds like a fun job. Have you ever had any interesting experiences on the road?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes. One time, I had to deliver a cake to a remote area, and the only way to get there was through a bumpy dirt road.<p class=message>Wow, that must have been challenging.<p class="message sent">It was, but when I finally got there, I was greeted by a beautiful wedding set-up. It was worth it.<p class=message>That's a great story. Well, here's your citation, Mr. Smith. Please drive safely and have a good evening.<p class="message sent">Thank you, officer. I will.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9d648928-0607-4212-b9ce-d83b030288a4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
