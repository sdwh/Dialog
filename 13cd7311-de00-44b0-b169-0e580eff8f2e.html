How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It was great, thanks for asking. I went to the beach with some friends. How about you?<p class=message>I spent some quality time with my family. We went to a theme park.<p class="message sent">That sounds like fun. Alright, so let's get started with the meeting. What's on the agenda for today?<p class=message>We need to discuss the new marketing campaign. Have you had a chance to review the proposal?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I have some questions though. Do you think it would be a good idea to include a social media influencer?<p class=message>That's actually a great idea! Which influencer do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of approaching that comedian who went viral on TikTok. I think he would be perfect for our brand.<p class=message>Interesting. Let's add that to the plan. Anything else?<p class="message sent">Yes, I also wanted to suggest having a giveaway or contest. It would generate more engagement and hype around the campaign.<p class=message>I like that. We can offer a free trip or a product giveaway. Let's work on the details later.<p class="message sent">Will do. Is there anything else you want to discuss?<p class=message>Nope, that's it for now. Thank you for your input, B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. Looking forward to making this campaign a success!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=13cbbd07-50e7-4a51-a785-6628998c9ff4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
