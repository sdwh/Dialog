Can you please state your name and why you're here in the station today?<p class="message sent">Hi there, my name is Jack and I was brought in for questioning. I swear I didn't do anything wrong.<p class=message>Oh, don't worry just yet. We're just doing routine checks. May I have your ID and address?<p class="message sent">Yeah, sure. Here's my ID and I live on Elm Street.<p class=message>Great, thank you. So, Jack, have you ever been arrested before?<p class="message sent">No, never. I'm honestly just confused as to why I was brought in.<p class=message>Well, we received reports of someone matching your description causing a disturbance in the park earlier today.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's just a misunderstanding. I like to carry my guitar around and play for people. I guess someone mistook it for a disturbance.<p class=message>Aha! So you're the guitar guy. I heard someone playing beautiful music in the park earlier.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that was me. I like to spread some cheer wherever I go.<p class=message>That's a great attitude to have. Alright, Jack, we're done here. Sorry for the inconvenience!<p class="message sent">No worries at all.
