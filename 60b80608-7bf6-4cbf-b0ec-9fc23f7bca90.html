I like how they solve the crimes.<p class=message>Yeah, it's like a puzzle. Speaking of puzzles, we should do a crossword together.<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds fun. But can we finish watching this episode first?<p class=message>Of course, we don't want to miss any important clues.<p class="message sent">Do you think we could solve a real-life crime one day, like on this show?<p class=message>Well, I don't know about that. But we could always volunteer at a local shelter or community service organization.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that sounds like a good idea too.<p class=message>Oh, look at that guy's outfit. He thinks he's a fashion icon.<p class="message sent">(laughing) That's ridiculous. I wouldn't be caught dead in that.<p class=message>Hey, I used to wear similar clothes when I was your age.<p class="message sent">(surprised) Really? That's hard to imagine.<p class=message>(chuckling) Yeah, some fashion trends never really go away.<p class="message sent">Well, I'll make sure to avoid that one in the future.<p class=message>Good call. (pauses) Hey, do you remember when we went to that event last month?<p class="message sent">Which one?<p class=message>The one with the food trucks and live music.<p class="message sent">Oh, yeah! That was awesome. Can we go to another one soon?<p class=message>Definitely. There's actually one coming up next week. We should invite some of your friends to join us.<p class="message sent">(excited) Yes! That would be so cool. Can we get some ice cream afterwards too?<p class=message>You read my mind.
