How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm doing okay, thanks for asking. I'm here today to talk about my mental health.<p class=message>Of course, that's why I'm here. What seems to be the issue?<p class="message sent">Well, I've been feeling really stressed lately with all of my assignments and exams.<p class=message>That's very common among students. Have you tried any coping mechanisms for stress?<p class="message sent">I've been going for runs and trying to get enough sleep, but it doesn't seem to be helping.<p class=message>Have you considered talking to a friend or family member about what you're going through? Support from others can be very beneficial.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have talked to my roommate and she's been very supportive. But I still feel like I need some more help.<p class=message>Okay. Have you ever tried meditation or yoga? Many people find these practices helpful for reducing stress.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't tried those before. But it's definitely something I'm willing to look into.<p class=message>Great! I can give you some resources for local yoga studios and meditation groups in the area.<p class="message sent">That would be awesome! Thanks so much for your help.<p class=message>No problem at all. Remember, prioritizing your mental health is just as important as your academic responsibilities.<p class="message sent">I will definitely keep that in mind. Thanks again!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ce47c6af-171f-4329-9708-03cd6d74c35f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
