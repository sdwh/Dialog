How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too. So, have you seen the specifications for the new internal website system we're developing?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. We're going to use Bootstrap and ASP.NET MVC 5, right?<p class=message>That's correct. I'm really excited about Bootstrap. The styling is so clean and modern.<p class="message sent">Yes, I couldn't agree more. And with ASP.NET MVC 5, we'll have a lot of flexibility with how we structure our code.<p class=message>Absolutely. Have you worked with Bootstrap before though?<p class="message sent">I actually haven't, but I've heard it's really easy to use. You just drop in the CSS and JavaScript files and you're good to go.<p class=message>That's true. It's also great for responsiveness. The pages we create will look great on mobile devices as well.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. What other features does Bootstrap have?<p class=message>Well, it has a lot of built-in components that we can use, like navigation menus, carousels, and forms. Plus, there are plenty of third-party plugins we can add if we need more functionality.<p class="message sent">Nice, sounds like it'll make our work a lot easier.<p class=message>Definitely. And with ASP.NET MVC 5, our code will be easier to maintain and test as well.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know what you mean. It's going to be great working with you on this project.<p class=message>Same to you, B. I'm looking forward to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fc57d2ab-d49d-461b-b327-53f11434b8de.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
