I’ve heard it’s like a security checklist for companies.<p class=message>That’s right! It’s a standard that ensures companies are handling sensitive information securely.<p class="message sent">Hmm, sounds intense. Have you been through one?<p class=message>Actually, I have. It was a lot of work, but definitely worth it.<p class="message sent">What kind of work did you have to do?<p class=message>We had to document all our security policies, procedures, and controls.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.<p class=message>Yeah, it was. But it also made us realize where we were lacking in our security measures.<p class="message sent">So, did you pass the audit?<p class=message>Yes, we did.<p class="message sent">Congrats! Do you have any tips for me? Our company will be going through it next month.<p class=message>Definitely! I recommend starting with a gap analysis to see where you need to improve. And make sure you involve everyone in the process, not just the IT department.<p class="message sent">Okay, that’s good to know. What about training? Did you do any training for your employees?<p class=message>Yes, we did. We made sure that everyone understood the importance of security and how to handle sensitive information.<p class="message sent">Got it. That makes sense. Do you think it’s worth it to get certified?<p class=message>Absolutely! It’s a great way to show customers and partners that you take security seriously.<p class="message sent">Okay, I’ll definitely talk to my boss about it. Thanks for all the tips!<p class=message>No problem! Good luck with your audit. And let me know if you need any more help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=30c228f8-9b25-438c-b987-5c7780715f9a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
