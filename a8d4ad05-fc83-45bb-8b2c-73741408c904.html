Would you like anything else with that? Our chicken rice is particularly popular this morning.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm actually feeling pretty hungry. Sounds good! Can I get a plate of chicken rice as well then?<p class=message>Of course! That's one plate of chicken rice and soy milk with fritters.

Your order will be ready shortly. Would you like to take a seat while you wait?<p class="message sent">Yes please, thank you! So, have you been working at this stall for long?<p class=message>Yes, I've been here for a few years now. My family has been selling chicken rice for generations.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's really impressive! What makes your chicken rice stand out from others?<p class=message>Well, we use only the best quality rice and freshly roasted chickens.

Enjoy your chicken rice and soy milk, and let me know if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Thank you very much! This looks amazing.
