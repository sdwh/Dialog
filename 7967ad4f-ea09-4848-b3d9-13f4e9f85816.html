How is it going?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I'm good. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing alright, thanks. I was hoping we could talk about the project timeline today.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, that's a great idea. What's on your mind?<p class=message>I was thinking we could aim for a completion date of August 31st. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that sounds a little tight to me. There are a lot of complex features we need to tackle.<p class=message>I understand. What would you suggest as an alternate date?<p class="message sent">Well, let me take a closer look at our requirements and I'll get back to you on that. But I can promise you this, it won't take us until Christmas.<p class=message>(chuckles) That's reassuring. We have to give clients enough time to test it before the end of the year.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and we don't want to ruin anyone's holiday season either.<p class=message>(laughs) No, definitely not. But seriously, let's keep the project on track and still allocate adequate time for testing and bug fixing.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We should also make sure we account for any unexpected issues that may arise.<p class=message>Good thinking. I also just remembered that we have a big team meeting tomorrow to discuss everything in more detail.<p class="message sent">Oh, right. I'll make sure I'm prepared with some dates and timelines to discuss.<p class=message>Sounds good. I'm excited to hear your input on this.<p class="message sent">Me too. And thanks for considering my perspective.<p class=message>Of course, we're a team, after all.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Together we'll make sure this project is a huge success.<p class=message>You got it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=796776bb-23e8-4048-a9b8-5a9387adc425.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
