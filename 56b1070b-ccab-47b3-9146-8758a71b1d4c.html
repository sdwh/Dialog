How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing well. How about you?<p class=message>Busy as usual, but I can't complain. So, what are our specials for the day?<p class="message sent">Today, we have some delicious tacos al pastor and carne asada. Also, we added a new item to the menu - tamales!<p class=message>That sounds great. I think I'll have the tacos al pastor for lunch today.<p class="message sent">Excellent choice, A. Our al pastor is marinated in a blend of spices, pineapple juice, and chipotle peppers. It's very flavorful.<p class=message>Yum, I can already taste it. So, how has business been lately?<p class="message sent">It's been pretty steady. We've had a lot of regular customers and some new ones who have heard about us through word of mouth.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm glad people are enjoying our food. Have you noticed any popular dishes recently?<p class="message sent">Yes, our guacamole and chips have been flying off the shelves. And our enchiladas verdes are always a hit.<p class=message>That's good to know. I'll have to try those enchiladas sometime. By the way, did you hear about the new Mexican restaurant opening up across town?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Do you think they'll be competition for us?<p class=message>Maybe, but I'm not too worried. We have our loyal customers and our own unique recipes that set us apart.<p class="message sent">Right, I agree. Plus, we have your managerial skills to keep us organized and running smoothly.<p class=message>(laughs) You're too kind, B. But thank you. Speaking of which, I need to get back to some paperwork. I'll see you later.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, A.
