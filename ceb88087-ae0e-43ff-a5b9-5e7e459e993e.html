Hackers are getting better at what they do.<p class=message>True, we need to find a way to protect our network before things get out of hand.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We should start by strengthening our firewall and patching up any vulnerabilities.<p class=message>That's a good idea. But we should also train our employees to be more aware of phishing attempts and other social engineering attacks.<p class="message sent">Yes, education is key. We can conduct frequent awareness campaigns to keep everyone on their toes.<p class=message>I hear you. But do you think we need to invest in more advanced security systems?<p class="message sent">It depends on our budget. But it's always better to be safe than sorry.<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's also make sure we have backups in place in case of a successful attack.<p class="message sent">Great point. And we should regularly test our backup and disaster recovery systems to ensure they work properly.<p class=message>Good call. We also need to conduct regular vulnerability assessments to identify and address any weaknesses.<p class="message sent">Bingo. And on top of that, we should monitor our network traffic for any suspicious activity.<p class=message>Right. And if we notice anything suspicious, we should quickly isolate the affected devices to prevent further damage.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And let's not forget to document our mitigation strategies in case we need to refer to them in the future.<p class=message>Wise words. With all these measures in place, we should be able to keep our network safe from any attacks.<p class="message sent">Fingers crossed. But we can't let our guard down. We always need to be on the lookout for potential threats.<p class=message>No doubt. But working together, we can definitely keep our network secure. Thanks for the great ideas, B!<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. Let's rock this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ceb852e8-32ea-44d9-b39f-60a66155ab57.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
