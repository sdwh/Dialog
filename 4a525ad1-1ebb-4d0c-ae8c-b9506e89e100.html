Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hello, pleasure to meet you as well. I'm a sommelier. Are you excited to try the food and wines here in Boulder?<p class=message>Yes, I am! I've heard great things about this restaurant. Have you been here before?<p class="message sent">Yes, many times actually. They always have amazing dishes to pair with their extensive wine list.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What's your favorite type of wine?<p class="message sent">I'm a fan of red wines, particularly the full-bodied ones. But I do love a good Chardonnay too. How about you?<p class=message>I enjoy both reds and whites, but I have a soft spot for ros√© during the summertime.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Well, let's start with this Chardonnay and try it with the appetizers. What do you think?<p class=message>Sounds like a perfect start. These shrimp tacos are amazing! The Chardonnay pairs perfectly with the citrus notes in the dish.<p class="message sent">I agree. And this steak is cooked to perfection. Let's try a Cabernet Sauvignon with it.<p class=message>Wow, the wine really brings out the flavors in the steak. Delicious.<p class="message sent">Glad you like it. This dessert wine is the perfect ending to our meal. It brings out the sweetness of the cheesecake.<p class=message>Absolutely. This has been a culinary adventure. Thanks for joining me, B.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. It was great to share this experience with another food and wine enthusiast.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4a51d01a-7907-4d00-baa5-60c4afeba0fa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
