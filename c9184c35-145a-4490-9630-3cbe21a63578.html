I've been working on my research proposal for our upcoming presentation.<p class=message>That sounds impressive. What are you researching?<p class="message sent">I want to investigate the effects of caffeine on the sleep patterns of college students.<p class=message>Interesting topic. What's your hypothesis?<p class="message sent">My hypothesis is that students who consume more caffeine will experience less quality sleep.<p class=message>Makes sense. What methods do you plan on using to gather your data?<p class="message sent">I'm going to conduct a survey and ask participants about their coffee consumption and sleep quality.<p class=message>That sounds like a good approach. How many participants are you planning on having?<p class="message sent">I think 50 students will be a good sample size to get a reliable result.<p class=message>Good idea. Have you thought about any potential challenges you might face during your research?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm worried about participants possibly lying about their coffee or sleep habits, but I'll address that in my survey.<p class=message>Great. Overall, I think your research is well-designed and should yield some interesting findings.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'm excited to see the results. And who knows? Maybe we'll end up solving the age-old question of whether coffee really affects sleep!<p class=message>Haha, that would be quite the breakthrough! Keep up the good work, B.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks for your support, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c915a9c2-86ea-4c36-bbb4-f275e9978aaa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
