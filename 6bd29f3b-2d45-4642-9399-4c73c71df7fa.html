Where are you heading?<p class=message>I’m headed to Marseille. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, once or twice. It’s a beautiful city, especially the old port.<p class=message>I’m excited to see it. I’ve heard a lot about the beaches there too.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, there’s nothing like a day at the beach. Do you have any plans while you’re there?<p class=message>Not really. Just planning to explore the city and maybe try some French food.<p class="message sent">You’ll definitely want to try some bouillabaisse. It’s a traditional seafood soup from Marseille.<p class=message>I’ll have to remember that. Have you tried it?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, it’s delicious. Speaking of food, do you have any favorite restaurants in your hometown?<p class=message>There’s a great Italian place that I love going to. Their spaghetti carbonara is amazing.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. I always love finding new restaurants to try.<p class=message>Yeah, me too. Have you ever thought about becoming a food critic?<p class="message sent">Ha! That would be a dream job. But driving a taxi lets me meet new people and see new places, which is pretty exciting too.<p class=message>Absolutely. Well, we’re almost there. Thanks for the great ride and the restaurant recommendation.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Have a great time in Marseille!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6bc9e967-fca2-4733-9056-7c8a9580803e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
