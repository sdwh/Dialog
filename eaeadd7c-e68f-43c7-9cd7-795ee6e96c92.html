What brings you to the course design center today?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm doing well. I'm here to work on selecting materials for my next class. It's always a challenge to find the right resources to engage my students.<p class=message>I hear you. What subject are you teaching?<p class="message sent">I'm teaching a creative writing class for intermediate level students.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds fun. Have you thought about incorporating any movies or books into the curriculum?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I was thinking of using "Dead Poet's Society" as a starting point for our unit on poetry.<p class=message>That's a great choice. It's a classic and Robin Williams' performance is unforgettable. Have you considered any additional activities to supplement the film?<p class="message sent">Yes, I thought we could have a "poetry slam" event where students can present their own original work to the class. I think it would really bring the lesson to life.<p class=message>Absolutely. Students will love the opportunity to express themselves and show off their skills. What about other resources? Are you planning on using any textbooks or online materials?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm using a textbook that covers a different writing style each week. And for online resources, I have a few writing prompts from websites like "Writer's Digest" that I think will be useful.<p class=message>Sounds like you have a well-rounded approach to your class. I have a suggestion for a potential field trip we could organize for the students. There's a local poetry festival next month that could be a fascinating experience for them.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I'm sure they would be excited to attend and hear some live readings.<p class=message>For sure. So it looks like you have all your bases covered. Thanks for chatting with me about your materials selection, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always helpful to bounce ideas off someone else. Thanks for your input!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eae99590-88df-4a0a-bad3-d1df2cc58722.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
