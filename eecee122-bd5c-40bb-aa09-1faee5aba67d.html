How're you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I'm feeling great. Ready to get started on our workout!<p class=message>Awesome! So, what's our plan for today?<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking we could focus on some strength training exercises.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. How about we start with some squats?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! I could always use some work on my lower body.<p class=message>Perfect. Let's aim for 3 sets of 10 reps. Remember to keep your back straight and engage your core.<p class="message sent">Got it. *starts doing squats*<p class=message>Great form, B! You're a natural at this.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I've been practicing.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. Alright, let's move on to some upper body work. How about we do some push-ups?<p class="message sent">Push-ups? I don't know if I can do those.<p class=message>Don't worry, B. We'll start with modified push-ups and work our way up. Ready to give it a try?<p class="message sent">Alright, I trust you. *starts doing push-ups*<p class=message>Looking good! Remember to keep your elbows close to your body.<p class="message sent">*struggling* This is harder than it looks.<p class=message>Don't worry, B. You're doing great. Just a few more reps!<p class="message sent">*finishes set* Whew, I made it!<p class=message>Great job. You're making progress every day.
