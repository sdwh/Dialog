What's your favorite part so far?<p class="message sent">I just started, but I'm already amused by the part where the Earth is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass.<p class=message>Haha, yes, that's a classic part. The book has a lot of witty humor like that. Enjoy the ride!<p class="message sent">Will do! What about you?
