How’s it going?<p class="message sent">Hey there! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. Are you headed somewhere specific in Miami today?<p class=message>Yeah, I’m meeting some friends for lunch at this amazing Cuban restaurant.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! I hope you have a good time.<p class=message>I’m sure I will. Have you ever been to Miami before?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, plenty of times. I used to come here a lot when I was a truck driver.<p class=message>Wow, I bet you have some interesting stories from your days on the road.<p class="message sent">Oh, you have no idea. One time, I drove through a blizzard in Montana that was so bad, I couldn’t see the road in front of me.<p class=message>That sounds terrifying. Have you ever had any scary experiences while driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">Yeah, a few. One time, a passenger left their pet snake behind in the backseat. I wasn’t expecting that, let me tell you.<p class=message>Yikes. I hope I don’t leave anything strange behind when we get to my destination.<p class="message sent">Haha, don’t worry about it. I’ll double check before you get out of the cab.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. So, what do you like to do in your free time when you’re not driving around Miami?<p class="message sent">Well, I’m a big sports fan. I like to catch a Heat game or a Dolphins game when I can.<p class=message>Nice, do you have any predictions for the next season?<p class="message sent">Well, you can never count out Tom Brady and the Buccaneers. But the Dolphins are my team, so I’m hoping they have a good year.<p class=message>I hear you. I’m more of a basketball fan myself, so I’m excited to see what the Heat can do this year.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, they’re always a fun team to watch. We’re almost there, by the way. That restaurant is just up ahead on the left.<p class=message>Thanks for the ride, driver! It was great talking to you.<p class="message sent">Anytime! Have a good lunch, and don’t forget to wave me down if you need a ride later.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4dc6ad54-65d1-4d69-9bdf-f507fd0cf6d9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
