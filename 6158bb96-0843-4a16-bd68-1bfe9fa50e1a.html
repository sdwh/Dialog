What book are you reading?<p class="message sent">Hey, I'm reading a book about the history of coffee. Did you know that coffee was discovered by a goat herder in Ethiopia?<p class=message>That's interesting! I never knew that. I'm reading a novel by Haruki Murakami. Have you read any of his works?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it about?<p class=message>It's about a man who undergoes a self-discovery journey and meets various eccentric characters along the way. It's a pretty surreal and philosophical read.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that sounds intriguing. I may have to check it out.<p class=message>You should! What made you choose a book about coffee?<p class="message sent">Well, I love coffee, and I wanted to learn more about its origins and how it became a popular beverage.<p class=message>I'm with you on that. I can't start my morning without a cup of coffee. Do you have a favorite type of coffee?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love a good latte, but I also enjoy trying different blends and roasts.<p class=message>Same here! Have you tried any exotic blends before?<p class="message sent">Actually, I once tried a coffee with notes of blueberry and it was fantastic. How about you?<p class=message>I've tried a coffee with hints of chocolate and it was heavenly. I'm always on the lookout for unique flavors.<p class="message sent">Me too! I think we have a lot in common when it comes to coffee.<p class=message>Certainly seems like it! Cheers to our love for coffee and reading.<p class="message sent">Cheers to that! It was nice chatting with you. I better get back to my book now.<p class=message>Likewise! Enjoy the rest of your read.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6155d2d8-c996-448c-901d-da0e2e6d22f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
