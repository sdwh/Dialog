How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">Not too bad. Just trying to make some money on the busy streets of Taipei. What brings you here?<p class=message>Oh, just a little sightseeing. I heard Taipei 101 is a must-see.<p class="message sent">It definitely is! It's one of the tallest buildings in the world. You'll get a great view of the city from there.<p class=message>That's what I hear! Do you have any good recommendations for places to eat around here?<p class="message sent">Yes! There's a great night market nearby that serves amazing snacks and street food. You'll love it.<p class=message>That sounds perfect! I'm always on the lookout for new food experiences. Do you have a favorite snack from that market?<p class="message sent">You have to try the stinky tofu. It may sound strange, but it's absolutely delicious!<p class=message>Haha, sounds intriguing! I'll definitely try it. So, how long have you been driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for about 5 years now. It's a tough job, but I enjoy meeting new people and hearing their stories.<p class=message>I can imagine. What's the craziest thing that's ever happened to you while driving?<p class="message sent">Well, one time a customer left a small suitcase in the back of my car. When I opened it, there was a million dollars inside!<p class=message>Wow, that's insane! What did you do?<p class="message sent">I returned it to the customer, of course. I couldn't live with the guilt of keeping something that wasn't mine.<p class=message>You're a good person! Well, here's my stop. Thanks for the ride and for the great conversation.<p class="message sent">No problem, have a great time in Taipei! And don't forget to try that stinky tofu!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e28e54c5-0422-4670-a850-489a4f714b96.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
