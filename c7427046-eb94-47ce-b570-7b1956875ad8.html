I'm busy making a variety of fresh bread today. Would you like to try one?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too! I love the smell of fresh bread. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Our sourdough bread is very popular. It has a chewy texture and a subtle tangy flavor.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. I'll have a slice of that with some butter.<p class=message>Great choice! I'll slice it for you right now. Do you also want some coffee to go with that?<p class="message sent">Yes please! What's your favorite coffee blend here?<p class=message>I personally love our house blend. It has a rich, creamy taste and a hint of chocolate.<p class="message sent">Sounds wonderful! Can I have a cappuccino with that blend?<p class=message>Coming right up! I'll also throw in a free croissant since it's your first time here.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's very kind of you! Thank you so much. These croissants are irresistible.<p class=message>You're welcome! Our pastries are all made with organic, high-quality ingredients. It's hard not to indulge in them.<p class="message sent">That's why I'll need to come back here often. Do you have any special flavors of bread or coffee?<p class=message>Yes, we have a cinnamon raisin bread and a hazelnut latte which are both popular. You could also try our seasonal pumpkin spice bread and latte.<p class="message sent">Those sound great! I'll be sure to try them later. Thank you for being so welcoming and informative.<p class=message>My pleasure. If you have any more questions, let me know. I'm always happy to help. Enjoy your breakfast!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c740e771-bc0f-4510-b88b-cb33fbeedec8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
