I'm excited.<p class="message sent">Yes, the Asahiyama Zoo is one of the popular attractions here in Hokkaido. They have a lot of protected animals here.<p class=message>That's fantastic. It's always great to see wildlife being protected.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. They even have a program where visitors can learn about the animals and their habitats.<p class=message>That's impressive. I would love to know more about their conservation efforts.<p class="message sent">There's a section on the zoo's website about their conservation activities. You can check it out later.<p class=message>Thanks, I will. So, what animals are you excited to see?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of penguins, so I always love visiting the penguin exhibit. And the polar bears are quite a sight!<p class=message>Yes, I can see how polar bears would make for great photos. Have you ever seen them in the wild?<p class="message sent">No, but I have gone on a safari to see brown bears. It was amazing.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds exciting. I have yet to try wildlife photography in the wild, but it's definitely on my bucket list.<p class="message sent">Hokkaido has a lot of nature reserves and national parks if you're interested. Some are equipped with cabins for visitors who want to stay.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. I'll keep that in mind for my next trip. Thanks for the tip!<p class="message sent">No problem. I am happy to share my knowledge about this beautiful place.<p class=message>You've been very helpful. It's been a pleasure working with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise!
