It's basically the process of using technology to improve business operations.<p class=message>Exactly! Companies need to adapt if they want to stay relevant in this digital age.<p class="message sent">It's all about staying ahead of the curve.<p class=message>But not all businesses are on board yet. Some are still hesitant to make the switch.<p class="message sent">That's true, but those who don't embrace it will be left behind.<p class=message>It's like that old saying, "adapt or die."<p class="message sent">Ha, I like that. But it's not just about surviving, it's also about thriving.<p class=message>Agreed. And one way to do that is to streamline processes through automation.<p class="message sent">Automation can save time and money, not to mention reduce errors.<p class=message>And let's not forget about the customer experience. Digital transformation can greatly enhance that too.<p class="message sent">Definitely. For example, online shopping and chatbots have become standard now.<p class=message>And speaking of chatbots, did you know that some companies are using artificial intelligence for customer service?<p class="message sent">No way! That's crazy.<p class=message>It's true! With the proper programming, AI can learn and analyze data to provide quick and accurate responses to customers.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. The possibilities really are endless.<p class=message>Absolutely. Not only does digital transformation lead to greater efficiency, but it can also spark innovation and new opportunities.<p class="message sent">I'm excited to see what the future holds.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=43d24b17-e1f2-4948-a7ad-bd736262c1c2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
