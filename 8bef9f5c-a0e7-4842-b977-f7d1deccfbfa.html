Are they any good?<p class=message>Oh man, they're amazing! They have all kinds of noodles and you can pick your own sauce and toppings.<p class="message sent">That sounds pretty delicious. What did you get?<p class=message>I got the spicy pork with udon noodles. It had a nice kick to it.<p class="message sent">I usually go for the classic beef and broccoli with lo mein noodles. Have you tried that one?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's one of my favorites too. But I also like the shrimp and vegetable with rice noodles. It's a bit lighter.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'll have to give that one a try. Oh, and have you tried making your own noodles at home?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it difficult?<p class="message sent">Not really. You just need some flour, eggs, and a pasta roller. It's actually really fun to make and you can customize it however you like.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea for a weekend activity. I might have to try that!<p class="message sent">Definitely do. And if you need any sauce recommendations, I have a killer peanut butter sauce recipe.<p class=message>Ooh, that sounds amazing. I'll definitely hit you up for that recipe.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a deal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8bef5f42-cb3f-40bb-aa00-ba732b265fec.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
