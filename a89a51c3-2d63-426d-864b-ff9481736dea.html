Where are you headed today?<p class=message>I'm on my way to Kyoto. I heard it's a beautiful city.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! The temples and shrines are really something else.<p class=message>Really? Which one is your favourite?<p class="message sent">I'd say Kiyomizu-dera. The view from up there is amazing!<p class=message>Oh, I'll make sure to visit it then. What do you like about being a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I like meeting new people and hearing their stories. It's always interesting.<p class=message>That's great. Do you have any funny or memorable experiences with passengers?<p class="message sent">Just last week, a man got in and told me he was in a hurry because he was late for his wedding!<p class=message>Oh no, did he make it?<p class="message sent">He did! He got there just in time.<p class=message>That's quite a story. What about your own hobbies? Do you have any?<p class="message sent">I like to play guitar in my free time. It's a nice way to relax.<p class=message>That's cool. I used to play piano when I was younger, but I haven't touched one in years.<p class="message sent">You should start again! Playing music is good for the soul.<p class=message>You're right. Maybe I will. Thank you for the conversation, driver. It made the ride more enjoyable.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Have a great time in Kyoto!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a8989403-5986-4b1b-b8e1-87ba5fa6cab7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
