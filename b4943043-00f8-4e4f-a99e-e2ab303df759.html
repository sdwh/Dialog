Then let's go through the list together. What's the first item?<p class="message sent">We need to buy milk. What brand do you prefer?<p class=message>I usually go for the organic milk from this brand 'Best Farms'. Have you tried it?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it expensive?<p class=message>Not really, it's reasonably priced. Let's check the price label and compare it to other options available.<p class="message sent">Sure, that's a good idea. Also, can you tell me which size to get?<p class=message>We usually get the quart sized bottle, as it lasts longer and has enough for our needs.<p class="message sent">Ok, that sounds good. What's next on the list?<p class=message>We need to get some eggs. Do we need to follow any specific dietary requirements?<p class="message sent">No, we don't have any specific requirements. But can we switch to the cage-free variety this time?<p class=message>Absolutely, let's look for it. And what about the cheese we need to buy?<p class="message sent">The recipe calls for feta cheese. Should we get it from our usual brand?<p class=message>I think we should, as it's really good. But let's check if there are any other varieties of feta cheese.<p class="message sent">Sure, good idea. Let's also check for any deals on cheese this week.<p class=message>Yeah, that's a smart move. What's next on the list?<p class="message sent">We need to buy some chicken breasts for dinner tomorrow. Which brand do you recommend?<p class=message>We can go for the 'Tyson' brand. It's always fresh and the quality is really good.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's check the price and size. Do we need bone-in or boneless?<p class=message>We usually get boneless chicken breasts, but we can also get the bone-in ones for variety.<p class="message sent">I agree. And what about the green beans we need for the side dish?<p class=message>We can get fresh green beans from the produce section. Do you think we need a certain amount?<p class="message sent">Let's see, the recipe calls for around two cups. Shall we get some extra for leftovers?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. And for the last item on the list, we need to buy some cereal. Do you have a preference?<p class="message sent">Yes, I usually go for the 'Honey Nut Cheerios'. What about you?<p class=message>I'm a big fan of the 'Frosted Flakes'. But let's see if there are any new flavors we can try.<p class="message sent">Sure, let's check. And do we need any particular size of the cereal box?<p class=message>I think the normal sized box will do just fine. Shall we add a few individual cereal cups to our cart for on-the-go breakfasts?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a good idea. Let's do it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b4935bc7-b0cf-4661-b7ee-a094fc498817.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
