Thanks for seeing me today. I have some questions about a contract agreement.<p class="message received message-content">Great! What type of contract is it?<p class="message sent message-content">It's a rental agreement for my apartment.<p class="message received message-content">Okay. What specific concerns do you have?<p class="message sent message-content">I'm not sure if the terms are reasonable. Can you go over them with me?<p class="message received message-content">Sure thing. Let's have a look at the agreement together.<p class="message sent message-content">Thank you. Also, there's a strange clause about a pet fee. Do I have to pay that?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, that is quite common. Many landlords charge a pet fee for tenants who have pets.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, I see. Well, I have a goldfish, so I hope that doesn't count.<p class="message received message-content">(Laughs) No, I don't think that will be an issue.<p class="message sent message-content">(Laughs) Okay, good to know. Thanks for your help.<p class="message received message-content">No problem. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?<p class="message sent message-content">No, that's it for now. Thanks again!<p class="message received message-content">You're welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other legal questions in the future. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=01a5744e-4c4a-4a72-8afa-6521e40e53ed.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
