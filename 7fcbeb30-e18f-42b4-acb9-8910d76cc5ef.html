I'm A, the barista here. Nice to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Hi there, A. I'm B, the roaster. Pleasure to meet you too.<p class=message>So, you're here to teach me the secret to preparing proper Spanish coffee?<p class="message sent">That's right, A. I heard you're interested in learning how to do it.<p class=message>Yes, I've always had a fascination with Spanish coffee, and I'm excited to learn from an expert like you.<p class="message sent">Well, it all starts with the beans. You need quality beans, roasted just right.<p class=message>Ah, I see. So it's not just about the technique, but also the quality of the beans.<p class="message sent">Exactly. Once you have good beans, you can play around with different brewing methods to suit your taste.<p class=message>Can you show me how to make café con leche?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. It's a classic Spanish coffee. First, you need to brew a strong espresso shot.<p class=message>Okay, got it. And then?<p class="message sent">Next, you add steamed milk in a 1:1 ratio with espresso, and then top it off with a layer of froth.<p class=message>That sounds easy enough. Let me give it a try… *sips* Mmm, delicious!<p class="message sent">Glad to see you're enjoying it, A. Just remember, practice makes perfect.<p class=message>Absolutely. I can't wait to keep experimenting with different blends and brewing methods.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit, A. With enough practice, you'll be a Spanish coffee pro in no time.<p class=message>Thank you for sharing your knowledge with me, B. It was a pleasure learning from you.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. Stop by anytime if you want to learn some more!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7fc8ed8a-fcca-4dc3-8a5e-a97ff32b7d1c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
