What do you think about the future of fishing industry?<p class="message sent">Well, matey, I have high hopes for sustainable fishing. It's the way to go.<p class=message>Aye, that's right. We need to start thinking long-term and protect our ocean resources.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And with the advancement in technology, we can now track fish populations and avoid overfishing them.<p class=message>That's a good point. But we also need to educate fishermen and consumers on the importance of sustainability.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It starts with the small actions we take. If we all do our part, we can make a big difference.<p class=message>Besides sustainability, have you heard of any other up-and-coming trends in the fishing industry?<p class="message sent">Well, there's a growing demand for farm-to-table seafood. People want to know where their food comes from and how it's caught.<p class=message>That makes sense. It's like the farm-to-table movement for land-based agriculture.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And it's not just for high-end restaurants. Everyday consumers want access to fresh, responsibly-sourced seafood.<p class=message>It's encouraging to see the industry moving in this direction. We just have to keep up with the demand and maintain the quality.<p class="message sent">Agreed, matey! It's an exciting time to be in the fishing industry. We can make a positive impact on both the environment and people's lives.<p class=message>Here's to a bright future! *clinks glass*</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b9d9ce88-f37e-407f-8b67-1762b89f0c7a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
