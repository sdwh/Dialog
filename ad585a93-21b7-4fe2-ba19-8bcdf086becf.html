Here we are at the famous Sensoji Temple in Asakusa. It is said to be Tokyo's oldest temple.<p class="message sent">That's right, A. The temple was initially built in the 7th century and was destroyed during World War II. The current structure dates back to the 1950s.<p class=message>Wow, that's quite a lengthy history. I'm sure our visitors are curious about the temple's cultural significance.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Sensoji Temple is dedicated to the Buddhist goddess of mercy, Kannon. It is believed that having her blessing brings good luck and good fortune.<p class=message>I can see why this temple is so popular for tourists and locals alike. Speaking of good luck, did you know that the temple has a unique way of granting it?<p class="message sent">Yes, A. The tradition of the temple is to offer omikuji, or fortune-telling paper slips, which visitors draw randomly from a box. It's said that if the fortune is bad, one can tie it at the temple to leave the bad luck behind.<p class=message>That's very interesting! I also heard that the surrounding streets of Asakusa have plenty of souvenir shops and food stalls.<p class="message sent">That's right, A. Nakamise Street is a popular shopping street that sells traditional items like kimonos, paper fans, and Japanese sweets.<p class=message>I think it's time that our guests start exploring the temple and its surroundings. Thank you, B, for your informative introduction, and let's meet again soon!<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. Have a great day, everyone!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ad58169d-39ec-4abc-a17c-0551bb151897.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
