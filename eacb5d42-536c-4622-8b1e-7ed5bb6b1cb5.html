Can you recommend me some of your best teas?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon! Of course, we have some premium loose-leaf teas that are quite popular among the locals. Have you tried our Darjeeling tea or perhaps our Oolong tea?<p class=message>Yes, I'm familiar with those teas. How about something a bit more unique? Do you have any blends or combinations that are particularly noteworthy?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We just introduced a new blend of black tea with vanilla and lavender that has been getting rave reviews. We also have a green tea mixed with jasmine and lemon that's quite refreshing.<p class=message>That sounds intriguing. How do you recommend preparing these teas for optimal flavor?<p class="message sent">It depends on the type of tea. For the black tea blend, I would suggest steeping it for three to five minutes in boiling water. The green tea blend should only be steeped for two to three minutes in water that's about 80 degrees Celsius.<p class=message>Thank you for the tips. I'm also interested in some specialty teas for my store's upcoming event. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">For events, I would recommend our traditional South African rooibos tea or our spicy chai tea. Both are great for sipping on a cold evening and pairing with desserts.<p class=message>Those both sound great. Finally, how about some teas for gift sets? I'm looking for something elegant and visually appealing.<p class="message sent">Our flowering teas are perfect for gift sets. They are hand-tied tea leaves that bloom into a beautiful flower when steeped in hot water. We also have some tea tins with delicate artwork on them that make great gifts.<p class=message>Wonderful! I think I'll take a bit of everything. Thank you for your help and expertise.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eac72cf8-1c3d-4acd-bddb-5e08ce5789b1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
