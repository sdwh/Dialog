But I’m a little bit mixed up about it.<p class=message>Sure! I’m here to help you with that. Can you tell me a bit more about when and how you’re taking your medications?<p class="message sent">I think my prescription said to take one pill in the morning and another pill at bedtime, but I’m not 100% sure.<p class=message>No problem! That’s a good start. Have you been able to keep track of when you took your pills and if you missed any doses?<p class="message sent">Well, kind of. I try, but sometimes I forget or I get confused.<p class=message>I understand. It can be difficult to remember everything. Let's take a look at the prescription together, and maybe we can set up a system that works for you.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Thank you so much.<p class=message>Of course! Also, I think it’s important to remember that taking medications as prescribed is important for your health, but it’s also okay to ask for help when you need it.<p class="message sent">That’s good to know. I’m glad you’re here to help me.<p class=message>It’s my pleasure. Do you have any questions or concerns about your medication or anything else related to your treatment plan?<p class="message sent">No, I think I understand everything now. Thanks again for your help.<p class=message>You’re welcome! If you have any questions in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">Thanks, you too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=19075c3c-92e3-47b9-80ff-60860b9397cb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
