I found this recipe online and I thought it would be fun to try.<p class=message>That's great! Can I help you with anything?<p class="message sent">Sure, you can help me sift the flour and sugar together.<p class=message>No problem, let's get started. Have you preheated the oven yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's already set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.<p class=message>Perfect. What flavor are we making today?<p class="message sent">Vanilla. I think it's a classic and simple flavor.<p class=message>I agree, sometimes less is more. Have you added the eggs yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, I think we need to whisk them first.<p class=message>Good catch, you definitely have an eye for detail.<p class="message sent">Thanks, mom. I learned a lot from you.<p class=message>Oh, that's so sweet of you to say. I'm proud of you, you know that?<p class="message sent">Yes, mom. I do. Can you pass me the milk please?<p class=message>Sure. Here it is.<p class="message sent">Thanks. Now, let's mix everything together.<p class=message>Great. I'll get the baking pan ready while you do that.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Can we also make some frosting?<p class=message>Of course, what do we need for that?<p class="message sent">Butter, powdered sugar, and some vanilla extract.<p class=message>Easy peasy. You can start on that while I prepare the pan.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's do it.<p class=message>This cake looks amazing. Did you do a taste test yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, mom. It's so good. I'm glad you helped me.<p class=message>You did most of the work, actually. I just assisted you.<p class="message sent">Still, I couldn't have done it without you.<p class=message>Awww, you're making me all teary-eyed.<p class="message sent">Don't cry, mom. It's just a cake.<p class=message>I know, but it's a special cake because we made it together.<p class="message sent">That's true. And it's delicious too.<p class=message>I totally agree. We should bake more often.<p class="message sent">Yes, let's make it a tradition.<p class=message>Deal.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4023860d-c38c-42a9-b0de-0e43740ea162.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
