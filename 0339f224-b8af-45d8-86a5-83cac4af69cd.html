How may I help you today?<p class="message sent message-content">Hi. I need to buy some medicine for my baby. He's been running a fever for a few days now.<p class="message received message-content">Oh, I see. How old is your baby?<p class="message sent message-content">He's just six months old.<p class="message received message-content">Alright. Can you tell me how high his fever has been?<p class="message sent message-content">It's been around 38-39 degrees Celsius.<p class="message received message-content">Alright. It sounds like he might need some medication to bring the fever down. Have you given him any medicine yet?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I have. But it doesn't seem to work that well.<p class="message received message-content">I see. Well, we have some different types of medication that can be given to babies. We have liquid medicine or suppositories that can be inserted rectally.<p class="message sent message-content">Which one do you think is better?<p class="message received message-content">It really depends on the baby's condition and your preference. If your baby is vomiting or refuses to take oral medication, suppositories might be a good option. Otherwise, liquid medicine is easier to administer.<p class="message sent message-content">Alright. I think I'll go with the liquid medicine then. Which brand do you recommend?<p class="message received message-content">There are several brands available, but I would recommend one that is specifically formulated for babies. Do you have a preference for a certain brand?<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, I'm not sure. Can you recommend one that's effective yet won't cause any side effects?<p class="message received message-content">Sure. We have some brands that are made with natural ingredients and are free from harmful chemicals. I think that would be a good option for your baby.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message received message-content">You're welcome. Is there anything else you need?<p class="message sent message-content">No, that's all. Thanks again!<p class="message received message-content">No problem. I hope your baby feels better soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=032b2eb6-7ff3-4432-9c5d-5feae50ff2aa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
