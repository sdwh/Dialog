How's your day going?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. So, I was going through some code and noticed a few bugs. Have you had a chance to go through it yet?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I went through it this morning. I noticed the same thing. It seems like there are some inconsistencies in the logic.<p class=message>Definitely. I'm glad we're on the same page. So, do you want to brainstorm some ideas on how to fix it?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. I was thinking we could try using some conditional statements to properly filter the data. What do you think?<p class=message>That's a good idea. Another approach could be to add some more validation checks to ensure the input data is correct.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I think a combination of both would be effective. We can also add some comments to the code to make it more comprehensible.<p class=message>Agreed. And we should have another person take a look at it before we commit the changes.<p class="message sent">Great point. We don't want to miss anything important.<p class=message>Exactly. So, how do you want to divide the tasks?<p class="message sent">How about I work on the conditional statements and you add the validation checks and comments?<p class=message>Sounds perfect. Let's get started on this cleanup, shall we?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm looking forward to seeing the improved code.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=54c72868-f98f-418d-97d6-1c679a02934b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
