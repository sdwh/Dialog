How are you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. I'm excited to work with you today and create some delicious treats for our customers.<p class="message sent">Me too! I heard you're the master of making amazing desserts. What are we going to make today?<p class=message>We'll be preparing our special matcha mille crepe cake and pairing it with some hand-dripped coffee blends. It's one of our most loved combinations among our customers.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing! I think my favorite coffee blend will go perfectly with the matcha flavor. Let's get started!<p class=message>Alright, let's start with the matcha mille crepe cake. Can you help me layer the crepes and spread the matcha cream in between?<p class="message sent">Of course! That's the fun part. While we're doing that, what's your secret to making such a delicious matcha cream?<p class=message>It's all about emphasizing the rich matcha flavor. I add just the right amount of matcha powder and sugar to balance the taste.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. And what about the coffee blends you've chosen? Are they also enhanced by a special ingredient?<p class=message>Actually, the key to our coffee's amazing taste is that we only use freshly roasted beans from our supplier in Taiwan. It gives the coffee a unique and bold aroma that our customers crave.<p class="message sent">Ah, that explains why everyone loves the coffee blends here. I can already smell the beans. How do you suggest we present our masterpiece?<p class=message>I think we can garnish the cake with some fresh fruits and edible flowers to add a pop of color. And, we can use clear glass cups to serve our coffee, showing off the beautiful layers.<p class="message sent">Wonderful idea! Our customers will be in heaven when they see and taste what we've created. I knew this was going to be a great partnership!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7e0327a6-cb80-46b7-9ee9-e16a002cf7bf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
