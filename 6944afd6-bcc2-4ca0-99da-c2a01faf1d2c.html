What brings you to my little orchard today?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm a pharmacist, and I'm always looking for new ways to create medicine. I heard your fruits are top-notch, so I thought I'd come take a closer look.<p class=message>Absolutely! We have a great variety of fruit trees here. Do you have any ideas on how we could use our fruit to make medicine?<p class="message sent">Well, actually, I've been working on a formula that uses certain compounds found in fruits to make pain relief medication. I think your peaches could be a great addition to the recipe.<p class=message>Interesting! I've never thought about using peaches to make medicine. How would that work?<p class="message sent">The compounds in the peach skins are actually similar to those found in aspirin. We could extract those compounds and use them in a natural pain reliever.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing! And what about our apples? Could they be useful too?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Apples are rich in antioxidants, which could be helpful in treating certain illnesses. We could extract those antioxidants and use them in our medicine.<p class=message>I had no idea our fruits had such powerful benefits! I'm excited to see what we can create together.<p class="message sent">Me too! And I must say, your orchard is truly beautiful. It's nice to be surrounded by such natural beauty while working on something so important.<p class=message>Thank you kindly, B. This orchard has been in my family for generations, and I'm proud to keep it thriving.<p class="message sent">And I'm proud to partner with you in creating something new and innovative. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=693904cc-0331-4226-bf4d-527e76507c75.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
