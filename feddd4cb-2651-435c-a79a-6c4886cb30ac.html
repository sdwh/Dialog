I was thinking about doing it at the airport.<p class=message>That's a good idea. Which currency do you want to exchange?<p class="message sent">I need to exchange Euros to Dollars. What about you?<p class=message>I need to exchange Yen to Dollars.<p class="message sent">Do you think we should exchange some here or wait until we get to the airport?<p class=message>It's probably better to wait. The exchange rate at the airport may be better.<p class="message sent">Yeah, you're probably right. Should we go to the currency exchange booth or use the ATM to withdraw cash?<p class=message>I usually go to the booth, but I heard that the airport ATM doesn't charge any fees for international transactions.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good deal. Let's go with that.<p class=message>Alright, but make sure you check with your bank first to make sure there aren't any hidden fees.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks for the heads up.<p class=message>No problem. Do you have your ID and passport ready for the transaction?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have them right here in my backpack.<p class=message>Great. Let's hope the lines aren't too long.<p class="message sent">Hopefully not. I don't want to miss our flight.<p class=message>Don't worry, we still have plenty of time before our departure.<p class="message sent">Okay, I feel better now. Let's go exchange our money so we can start our trip off on the right foot.<p class=message>Agreed! Let's go get some cash!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fed85bc4-54e5-4e84-b237-083d0d089875.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
