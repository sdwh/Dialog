I'm excited to cook up some delicious South African dishes for our guests today.<p class="message sent">Hello, A! That sounds amazing. What specials do we have on the menu today?<p class=message>We have bobotie, which is a spiced meat and egg dish, and boerewors, which are grilled sausages.<p class="message sent">Yum! I love trying new foods. Which one do you recommend?<p class=message>Personally, I think the bobotie is a must-try. It's a traditional dish that's been enjoyed in South Africa for generations.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll recommend it to our guests then. Do we have any vegetarian options?<p class=message>Yes, we have butternut squash and lentil curry, which is a flavorful vegan dish.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I have a feeling that one will be popular. How spicy is it?<p class=message>It has a mild spice to it, but we can adjust it to the guest's preference.<p class="message sent">Great, thank you for letting me know. By the way, have you tried any South African wines? I hear they're quite good.<p class=message>Yes, I have! My favorite is pinotage. It's a red wine that's unique to South Africa.<p class="message sent">Interesting, I'll have to give it a try. Speaking of wine, do we have any dessert wines to pair with our dessert specials?<p class=message>We have a Klein Constantia sweet wine that pairs perfectly with our malva pudding.<p class="message sent">I'm sold. I think I'll have some malva pudding and that sweet wine after our shift tonight.<p class=message>Sounds like a great plan. Let's get cooking, shall we?<p class="message sent">Let's do it! I'll start taking orders and let the guests know about our specials.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=94c6d72a-8896-464d-b988-3ff9fe924cae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
