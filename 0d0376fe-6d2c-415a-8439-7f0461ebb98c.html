We're building an internal website system for our company using ASP.NET Razor Pages!<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did. I think it's going to be a great project to work on. I'm excited to see the final product.<p class=message>Same here! I think it's going to be challenging but worthwhile. Are you comfortable using Razor Pages?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I've had experience with it before, and I think it's a great tool for building web applications.<p class=message>That's awesome. I'm still learning the ropes, so I might have to ask you for some help from time to time.<p class="message sent">Of course! Happy to lend a hand whenever you need it.<p class=message>Do you have any ideas for the design or layout of the website? I was thinking we could incorporate some bright colors and fun graphics to make it more engaging.<p class="message sent">I like that idea! It's always good to have a visually appealing website. Maybe we could also add some interactive features to keep users engaged.<p class=message>Yes, exactly! I was thinking we could include a chatbot for users to interact with, or maybe even a virtual assistant.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! We could also look into integrating some AI features to make it more intelligent and efficient.<p class=message>Definitely! I think this website is going to be a game-changer for our company.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It'll make things so much easier for employees to access information and collaborate with each other.<p class=message>And hopefully, it'll be fun to use too!<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Let's get to work and make this website unforgettable.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0d00f297-64d1-42aa-a085-dbc3e2ff709a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
