I heard they're amazing.<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. They're really good. How do you like yours?<p class=message>Hmm, I'm not quite sure. This is my first time trying them.<p class="message sent">Well, let me tell you, they're an acquired taste. But if you like seafood, you should definitely give them a go.<p class=message>Okay, I'll try one. *slurps oyster* Oh wow, that's interesting. It's slimy, but tastes pretty good.<p class="message sent">That's the briny flavor. It's an acquired taste, but it's so worth it if you want to broaden your food horizon.<p class=message>I see what you mean. It's definitely an interesting taste. Do people usually put anything on their oysters?<p class="message sent">Some people like to add lemon juice or hot sauce to theirs. But personally, I think the best way to eat them is just with a little bit of saltine crackers and hot sauce on the side.<p class=message>I'll have to try that next time. This is actually quite enjoyable.<p class="message sent">See, I told you! Once you get past the texture, you'll start appreciating the taste more and more. It's quite a delicacy.<p class=message>You know what, I think I'll order another dozen. Thanks for convincing me to try them.<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to spread the oyster love!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a25260e1-4223-4b04-b3d8-509e772defb5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
