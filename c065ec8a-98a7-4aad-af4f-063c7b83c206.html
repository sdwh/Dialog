It's great to be here tonight.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! And I have to say, I'm pretty nervous. I was backstage and I saw a sign that said "break a leg", and I'm thinking, "Wait, is that a good thing?"<p class=message>Ha! I know what you mean. You know, my mom always told me to "break a leg" before a big event. But then again, she also told me to "be a sport" when I was playing video games, so I don't always trust her advice.<p class="message sent">Well, I guess we'll just have to hope for the best. So, have you ever noticed that in English, we use a lot of weird expressions?<p class=message>Oh yeah, definitely. Like "let the cat out of the bag". I mean, if you really think about it, that's a pretty strange thing to say.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. But you know what's even weirder? The fact that we have different expressions for the same thing in different parts of the world. For example, in the UK they say "tickety-boo" instead of "hunky-dory". I mean, what even is that?<p class=message>I have no idea. But you know what's really confusing? Trying to explain English to non-native speakers. Like, how do you even explain the difference between "they're", "their", and "there"?<p class="message sent">Oh man, don't even get me started on that. It's like we're intentionally making it difficult for people to learn our language.<p class=message>Well, I have to say, you're doing a pretty good job of making me laugh. I think I might even forget about the whole "breaking a leg" thing.<p class="message sent">Ha! That's what I like to hear. You know, they say laughter is the best medicine, so if we keep this up we might just cure the common cold.<p class=message>In that case, let's keep it going. I'll tell you a secret: I once tried to learn how to juggle, but I kept dropping the balls. And then I realized, maybe I'm not cut out for this... I should stick to my day job.<p class="message sent">Hey, you never know. Maybe you're a natural comedian and you just don't know it yet.<p class=message>Haha, well, stranger things have happened. And to be honest, I'd rather someone laugh at me dropping balls than someone laugh at me singing karaoke.<p class="message sent">Singing karaoke is a whole other ballgame, my friend. But you know what they say: "dance like nobody's watching, sing like nobody's listening, and laugh like you don't care who's laughing with you."<p class=message>I couldn't have said it better myself. It looks like our time is almost up, but I just wanted to say thanks for the laughs. You really made my night.<p class="message sent">Anytime, my friend. And remember, if you ever need a laugh, just think of me and my terrible juggling skills.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c064cd6d-624a-40fd-8d09-199a1781cc99.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
