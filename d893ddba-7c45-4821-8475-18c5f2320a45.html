I'm so glad we made it to the top.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's incredible, isn't it? You can see for miles.<p class=message>How did you get into guiding, anyway?<p class="message sent">I've always loved being outdoors and exploring new places. I studied outdoor education in college and then started guiding tours.<p class=message>That's amazing. This is definitely a trip I will never forget.<p class="message sent">Glad to hear it! Have you done much hiking before?<p class=message>Yeah, I've done some hiking back at home, but nothing like this. The scenery is just so different.<p class="message sent">Yes, Tasmania is definitely unique. I'm always amazed by how untouched some of these areas are.<p class=message>Have you ever had any close encounters with animals out here?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. Once I was leading a group and we stumbled upon a family of wombats. They were so cute, and didn't seem afraid of us at all.<p class=message>That's hilarious. Wombats seem like the friendliest animals out here.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Well, shall we start heading back down?<p class=message>Yeah, let's go. But one more thing, do you have any favorite hikes in Tasmania?<p class="message sent">There are so many good ones, but my personal favorite is probably the Overland Track. It's a multi-day trek through some of the most beautiful landscapes in Tasmania.<p class=message>Sounds amazing. I'll have to add that to my list for next time. Thanks for everything, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It was great having you on the trip.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d8926472-1f0e-4ece-a0cf-434cbab6782c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
