How many people are in your party?<p class="message sent">Hi there, just me tonight. Is it possible to sit by the window?<p class=message>Of course, right this way. Here is your menu. May I suggest our special dish tonight â€“ grilled lobster?<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious! I'll definitely try that. Can I also have a glass of red wine, please?<p class=message>Absolutely. Anything else I can assist you with?<p class="message sent">Yes, may I have some bread while I wait for the lobster? And do you have any recommendations for appetizers?<p class=message>Sure thing! Our garlic bread is always a popular choice. As for appetizers, our calamari is a hit with many customers.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll take your recommendations. So, how long have you been working here?<p class=message>I've been working here for about a year now. It's been a wonderful experience, I get to meet new guests every day!<p class="message sent">That's really interesting. Do you have any funny stories with customers?<p class=message>Actually, there was a time when a guest ordered an omelette but didn't want any eggs in it. It took some time for me to wrap my head around that one!<p class="message sent">That's hilarious! I can't imagine having an omelette without eggs.<p class=message>Yes, it was definitely one of the most memorable orders I've had. Here's your bread and wine, your appetizers and your delicious grilled lobster dish! Enjoy your meal!<p class="message sent">Thank you so much. This looks amazing! You've been a great help tonight.<p class=message>You're welcome! I hope you have a wonderful evening. Feel free to let me know if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks again!<p class=message>No problem, it's my pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e4b95e66-54e4-4ce7-aa01-465e0056fc79.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
