How's it going?<p class="message sent">Great, thanks! How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. So, we're here to discuss the development of an application for online booking and boarding, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. We want to make the process seamless and simple for our customers.<p class=message>Definitely. So, what ideas do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, we could have a user-friendly interface that allows customers to easily search for flights and select their preferences.<p class=message>That sounds good. And we could also integrate a payment gateway to ensure secure transactions.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we could also include a feature that allows customers to choose their seats and meal options during the booking process.<p class=message>That's a great idea. And for the boarding process, we could have a QR code generated for each customer's ticket that they can use to board the flight.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And we could also have an option for customers to prepay for baggage and other add-ons.<p class=message>And we should make sure the app is available on both iOS and Android platforms.<p class="message sent">Of course. And we should also consider including a loyalty program for our frequent flyers.<p class=message>That's a fantastic suggestion. I think this app is going to be a game changer.<p class="message sent">Agreed! We just need to ensure that the app is user-friendly and reliable.<p class=message>Yes, and we'll need to thoroughly test it before launch.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Well, it sounds like we have a solid plan. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=de9dddd6-43db-4f05-b26b-a95a99d47a1b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
