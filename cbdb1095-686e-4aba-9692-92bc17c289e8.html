I’m in charge of checking the quality of the products here. What’s your name?<p class="message sent">Hi! My name is Jae. I’m a kimchi maker. It’s nice to meet you.<p class=message>It’s nice to meet you too, Jae. So, how long have you been making kimchi?<p class="message sent">I’ve been making kimchi for about 20 years now. It’s a traditional part of my culture, and I love it.<p class=message>That’s amazing! I’ve always been curious about how kimchi is made. Can you tell me a little about the process?<p class="message sent">Sure! First, you have to soak the cabbage in salt water. Then you mix in the spices, like red pepper flakes, and let it ferment for a few days to develop the flavors.<p class=message>That sounds pretty easy. I might have to try making it myself. Have you ever made any unusual flavors?<p class="message sent">Oh yes! I’ve made kimchi with radishes, carrots, and even pears! It’s fun to experiment with new flavors.<p class=message>Wow, that’s really creative. I’ll have to keep an eye out for those. How do you know when the kimchi is ready to eat?<p class="message sent">It’s all about the taste. When the fermentation is complete, it should have a tangy flavor with a little bit of spice.<p class=message>I see. Well, it all looks and smells delicious to me. Have you always wanted to be a kimchi maker?<p class="message sent">Actually, when I was younger, I wanted to be a singer! But I realized that cooking was my true passion.<p class=message>That’s great that you found your calling. Do you have any advice for someone who wants to start making kimchi?<p class="message sent">Don’t be afraid to experiment! Kimchi is a very forgiving dish, and you can make it your own by adding or removing spices based on your preferences.<p class=message>Good advice! Thanks, Jae. It was great talking to you about kimchi.<p class="message sent">Thank you! It was nice meeting you too, A. Enjoy the rest of your day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cbd93144-f645-4180-a4d9-c6664bc6cd73.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
