How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. Did you have a good weekend?<p class="message sent">I did! I went on a hike in the mountains nearby. How about you?<p class=message>I visited some friends and we baked some bread together. That's why I'm a bread baker!<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like fun. Speaking of bread, have you tried our bakery's croissants? They're delicious.<p class=message>Actually, I have. They're some of the best I've had in Taipei.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that. So, what can I get for you this morning?<p class=message>I'll have the usual - an espresso with a toasted piece of bread. And what about you?<p class="message sent">I'll go for a cappuccino and a breakfast pasta, please. How do you make your espresso?<p class=message>We grind the beans fresh each time, and pull a shot that usually takes around 25 seconds. It's all about the right amount of pressure and temperature.<p class="message sent">Interesting. I love how coffee-making can be such an art form. The same goes for pasta-making, too!<p class=message>Yes, there's something special about creating something from scratch. Speaking of pasta, how do you make yours?<p class="message sent">We use a traditional Italian recipe for our pasta, and add in fresh seasonal ingredients like cherry tomatoes or mushrooms. It makes for a really flavorful dish.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll have to try it sometime. Oh, and here's your espresso and pasta. Bon appetit!<p class="message sent">Thanks! And here's your bread and espresso. Cheers to a good morning!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=66be29d7-6f28-48eb-b202-f302113b97ae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
