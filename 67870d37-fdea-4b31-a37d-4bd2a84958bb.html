How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was great! I actually spent most of it in the music studio with our band.<p class=message>That's awesome! How did the rehearsals go?<p class="message sent">They went pretty well, all things considered. We're getting ready for our next gig at the end of the month.<p class=message>I heard that A has been working on some new material. How's that going?<p class="message sent">Yeah, A's been killing it lately. We've been playing around with some new sounds and experimenting with different rhythms and tempos.<p class=message>That sounds exciting! What's been your favorite song to work on so far?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely the one we're calling "Electric Dreams." It's got this killer guitar riff and some super catchy lyrics.<p class=message>Nice! I can't wait to hear it. When's the next time you guys are playing?<p class="message sent">We've got a show at the end of the month, like I said. It's at this pretty cool club downtown. You should come check it out!<p class=message>for sure! I wouldn't miss it for the world. Speaking of shows, have you guys thought about merchandising? You know, t-shirts and stuff?<p class="message sent">Actually, yeah. We've been looking into that. We're thinking about screenprinting some shirts and selling them at our shows.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I'd buy one! You guys are gonna be famous in no time.<p class="message sent">Don't jinx us, man! We're just enjoying playing together for now. If we make it big someday, that would just be a bonus.<p class=message>Fair enough. I'm just excited to see where you guys end up. Keep up the good work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=677f64a9-36c8-4886-b96b-3ed8aaf6dfc2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
