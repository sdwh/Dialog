How much do you know about ISO 27001 Physical Security?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! To be honest, not much. But I'm willing to learn. Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I just attended a seminar about it and it’s really interesting. It’s about the security of physical assets.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So, what did you learn from the seminar?<p class=message>One of the key takeaways was the importance of access control. You have to make sure that only authorized personnel can enter restricted areas.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. How about CCTV?<p class=message>Yes, that's also important. You need to have a system that can monitor the physical space 24/7.<p class="message sent">What about alarms, though? Do you think it's necessary?<p class=message>Definitely. Alarm systems, especially for critical areas, are the first line of defense in case of a breach.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. How about fire protection?<p class=message>That's important too! You have to make sure that fire exits and fire extinguishers are readily available.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's always best to be prepared. How about electricity and lighting?<p class=message>Very important! You don't want your server room to shut down because of a power outage or have your officemates hurt themselves due to poor lighting.<p class="message sent">That's so true. How about emergency procedures?<p class=message>Another important aspect. It's important for everyone to know what to do in case of an emergency, like a fire or a security breach.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I think we should also have a backup generator in case of a power outage.<p class=message>That's a good point! It's always best to be prepared for anything.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and it’s a good thing that ISO 27001 is there to help us ensure the physical security of our assets.<p class=message>Exactly. It’s all about minimizing risks and making sure that everything is secure.<p class="message sent">I'm definitely going to look into it more. Thanks for sharing what you've learned, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fd0913c1-75d2-407b-a2ab-6c25259bce99.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
