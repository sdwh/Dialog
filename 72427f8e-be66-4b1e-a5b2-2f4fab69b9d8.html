How are you today?<p class="message sent">Hello, A! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, just a little sore from yesterday's rehearsal. But I'm excited to get started today!<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! So, let's start with the opening section again. I feel like we could still make some improvements there.<p class=message>Sure thing. Do you have any specific changes in mind?<p class="message sent">I was thinking we could add in some more jumps and turns to really make it pop.<p class=message>Sounds like fun! I'm ready to give it a try.<p class="message sent">Excellent. And while we're on the topic, have you seen that viral video of the cat attempting to do a pirouette?<p class=message>(laughs) Yes, I have! It's so cute. Do you think we could incorporate some cat-like movements into one of our pieces?<p class="message sent">(smiling) I don't see why not! Maybe we can add some playful leaps and pretend to chase after a toy mouse.<p class=message>(excitedly) Ooh, I love that idea! I'll start brainstorming some movement ideas for that section.<p class="message sent">(approvingly) Perfect. And speaking of ideas, have you thought about what you're going to wear for our performance next week?<p class=message>(thoughtfully) Hmm, not really. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">(grinning) Well, I was thinking we could both wear those sparkly leotards you found at the thrift store last month.<p class=message>(laughing) Oh no, not those! They're so glittery.<p class="message sent">(jokingly) Come on, A. You know you love a little sparkle.<p class=message>(grinning) Fine, fine. But only if you promise to wear a tutu.<p class="message sent">(laughing) Deal. Alright, let's get back to rehearsing that opening section. It's going to be a showstopper!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=723e8d05-b5a0-4b3e-acaf-788cc14b6204.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
