We have a new cake recipe to try out.<p class=message>Sounds exciting! What's so special about this recipe?<p class="message sent">It's a fusion of vanilla and matcha flavors. We are trying to create a unique combination that caters to more diverse tastes.<p class=message>That's brilliant! So, what's the recipe we will be using?<p class="message sent">It's a simple sponge cake recipe with some matcha powder mixed in. We will also be using a vanilla flavored frosting for the finishing touch. Here's our recipe sheet.<p class=message>Thanks, B. Let's get started.<p class="message sent">Great, let’s set the oven at 180 degrees Celsius and bake our batter for 30 minutes.<p class=message>While the cake is baking, do you have any fun stories about baking?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I used to work at a bakery where we had to make cookies in the shape of animals. It was a hilarious sight when the cookies would come out looking like weird hybrid creatures.<p class=message>Haha, that sounds like a lot of fun. Have you ever made any baking mishaps?<p class="message sent">Oh, plenty! Just last week, I mixed up the salt and sugar in a recipe, so the entire cake was unbearably salty.<p class=message>That's quite a mishap! The cake must have been inedible.<p class="message sent">It was, unfortunately. But that's just part of the baking process; we learn from our mistakes.<p class=message>Absolutely, and it’s a learning curve too. Wow, our cake is looking and smelling amazing, and the timer just went off.<p class="message sent">Great, let's check it with a toothpick to make sure it's cooked through.<p class=message>Looks like it's done. Now, let's decorate it with our vanilla frosting and some matcha powder on top.<p class="message sent">Perfect! Let's have a little taste now.<p class=message>Mmm, that's delicious! The flavors work really well together.<p class="message sent">I agree. I think we have a winner here!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aeb48f97-c0b8-403a-b423-03f99f0e85f0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
