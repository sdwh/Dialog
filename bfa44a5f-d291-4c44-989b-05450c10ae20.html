I heard you're the DevOps engineer for this bank.<p class="message sent">Yep, that's me! And you're the cloud engineer, right?<p class=message>You got it. So, what do you think of the idea of moving all our applications to the cloud?<p class="message sent">Well, if it's done right, it could definitely streamline our processes and make things more efficient.<p class=message>Agreed. But, we also need to make sure we're keeping everything secure.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Security is paramount, especially for a bank. You wouldn't want your savings account getting hacked, would you?<p class=message>Definitely not! But, I'm sure we can figure it out. Do you have any experience with implementing security measures in a cloud environment?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I've done it all. From network security to encryption, I've got you covered.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm more focused on the deployment and management side of things. Have you worked with any deployment tools?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've used Ansible, Puppet, and Chef. What about you?<p class=message>I'm all about Terraform and Kubernetes.<p class="message sent">Nice! Those are some powerful tools. Speaking of deployment, have you ever had to deal with a failed deployment in the cloud?<p class=message>Unfortunately, yes. But hey, mistakes happen, right? The important thing is being able to fix it quickly.<p class="message sent">Exactly. It's all about being able to roll back changes and having a solid disaster recovery plan in place.<p class=message>You're definitely preaching to the choir here. I've seen how quickly things can go wrong in the cloud.<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah, it's not always sunshine and rainbows. But hey, that's what makes it exciting, right?<p class=message>Absolutely! There's nothing like the rush of fixing a critical issue and getting things back up and running.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit! It sounds like we're on the same page here. With our combined expertise, we'll be able to get these applications in the cloud in no time.<p class=message>Agreed! Let's get to work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bfa24a4f-1ea9-4649-a20c-97c94c9e5bae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
