Any interesting cocktails planned?<p class="message sent">Hey A, everything's good so far! I've been experimenting with a new recipe for a spicy margarita. I think I've finally got it just right.<p class=message>That sounds awesome! Customers are really going to love that. What else have you got up your sleeve?<p class="message sent">Well, I've been trying to incorporate more Thai flavors into our drinks. I've got a lemongrass-infused gin cocktail that's been getting a lot of positive feedback.<p class=message>Nice, I love when we can showcase local ingredients. What about the food menu? Any new additions?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we're going to start offering some smaller plates to go along with the cocktails. I've got a delicious fried chicken sandwich that's going to blow people's minds.<p class=message>Fantastic, I can't wait to try it. Speaking of which, have you had a chance to sample the new wine selection?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I heard we've got some fantastic bottles in. I'll make sure to give them a taste later.<p class=message>Sounds good, let me know what you think. And don't forget to give me feedback on any drink or food changes you think we should make.<p class="message sent">Will do, I'm always looking for ways to improve. By the way, how's business been?<p class=message>It's been good, we've been getting a lot of positive buzz lately. Especially since we were featured in that local magazine.<p class="message sent">Oh nice, I didn't know that! We should celebrate with a round of shots.<p class=message>(laughs) I like the way you think. Let's make it happen.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed0a5c94-f9fb-46a3-adef-e05d5d598221.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
