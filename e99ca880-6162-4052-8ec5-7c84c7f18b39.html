How's business today?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty well, A. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain, the scent of our freshly cooked pancakes and your sweet and juicy fruit platters is filling the air and attracting lots of customers.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I noticed that too. We make a good team, don't we?<p class=message>Absolutely! So, what fruits do you have today?<p class="message sent">We have some locally grown mangoes, pineapples, and papayas. They are all very ripe and juicy.<p class=message>Yum! That sounds so refreshing. By the way, what kind of pancakes do you recommend to pair with the fruit platters?<p class="message sent">The banana pancakes would go really well. The sweetness of the pancake and the fruit complement each other really nicely.<p class=message>That's a great suggestion! Maybe I'll have one for my lunch, too!<p class="message sent">That's a good idea, A! And if you want something a little bit different, we could also pair your pancakes with dragon fruit or longan.<p class=message>Wow, I've never tried that before. Can I get a taste of it first?<p class="message sent">Of course! Here you are. What do you think?<p class=message>Mmm! That's delicious! The sweetness of the dragon fruit really balances out the savory taste of the pancake. I'd like to order a plate of that, please!<p class="message sent">Sure! Coming right up. By the way, I heard from the vendors down the street that there's going to be a traditional Chinese parade later today. Have you heard anything about it?<p class=message>Yes, I did. I'm really excited about it! I heard there will be dragon and lion dance performances, and lots of colorful lanterns decorating the streets.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! We should try to catch a glimpse of it when we have a break later.<p class=message>Definitely! I hope we'll have plenty of time to enjoy the parade and all the festivities.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. Let's grab some pancakes and fruit, and go catch up with the parade together.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Let's make the most of this vibrant and lively Yaowarat Chinatown.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e9947581-dff6-4ee3-b3a8-fa22d92df4df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
