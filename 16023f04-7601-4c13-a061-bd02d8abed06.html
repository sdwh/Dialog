Have you heard about ISO 27001 Information Security?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have heard about it. It is a standard for information security management systems, right?<p class=message>Exactly! It's like Batman for information security. It saves the day.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I like that analogy. So, what does it cover?<p class=message>Well, it covers everything from risk assessment to asset management. It's like a superhero suit that protects your information.<p class="message sent">Cool! So, why do companies need to follow this standard?<p class=message>It's like having insurance for your information. You never know when danger could strike, but if you're prepared, you'll be able to handle it.<p class="message sent">Right, and it also shows that the company is taking information security seriously, which helps build trust with customers.<p class=message>Exactly! It's like putting on a good pair of shoes before running a marathon. You want to be prepared for any obstacles.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I like your shoe analogy. So, have you worked with ISO 27001 before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's like being a detective - you have to find all the potential risks and vulnerabilities and make a plan to neutralize them.<p class="message sent">That sounds challenging, but also fun in a way. It's like solving a puzzle.<p class=message>Yes, it is! And the best part is that you get to be a hero in the end by protecting your company's information.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I love it! Thanks for explaining it to me in a fun way.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=15f6f19f-5827-4490-8010-08c52fb1c691.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
