Going to Australia Gold Darwin, huh?"<p class="message sent">"Yup, that's the plan. Have you been there before?"<p class=message>"Nope, it's my first time. I heard they have amazing beaches though."<p class="message sent">"Oh, definitely. But if you really want to experience something fun, you should try crocodile watching."<p class=message>"Crocodile watching? That sounds scary."<p class="message sent">"Nah, it's not that bad. Just make sure you're not wearing any bright colors or you might become an easy target for them."<p class=message>"Yikes, I'll keep that in mind!"<p class="message sent">"Don't worry, you're in good hands. I've been living here for a while now and I know these crocs like the back of my hand."<p class=message>"That's good to know. How long have you been driving taxis?"<p class="message sent">"Oh, almost a decade now. It's been a pretty interesting ride, I must say."<p class=message>"I bet you've met all kinds of people."<p class="message sent">"Oh yeah, you wouldn't believe some of the stories I've heard. What about you? What do you do?"<p class=message>"I'm a software engineer. I'm actually going to a conference in Darwin."<p class="message sent">"A software engineer, huh? That's cool. I don't know much about computers, but I do know how to drive this baby."<p class=message>"Ha! That's all that matters for the moment. Do you have any recommendations for good restaurants in Darwin?"<p class="message sent">"Well, there's plenty of great places to eat. But if you're looking for something unique, you should try kangaroo meat."<p class=message>"Interesting. I'll give it a try. Thanks for the tip!"<p class="message sent">"No problem. Just be sure you only eat the tail or the tenderloin. The rest of the meat can be pretty tough."<p class=message>"Got it. You're a lifesaver, thanks."<p class="message sent">"Hey, happy to help. We'll be there shortly. Enjoy your stay in Darwin!"</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=17b88431-6719-43e4-bcfe-10ab397d0929.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
