I tried it this morning and it’s amazing. Have you tried it yet?<p class=message>No, not yet. I’m trying to resist the temptation. I’m trying to cut down on caffeine.<p class="message sent">Good for you. I should probably do the same. So, how were your holidays?<p class=message>They were good, thanks. I went home to visit my family. What about you?<p class="message sent">I went on a ski trip with some friends. It was so much fun, but I definitely feel like I need a vacation from my vacation now.<p class=message>I know exactly how you feel. I always need a few days to recover after traveling.<p class="message sent">Hey, did you hear about the new employee training program?<p class=message>No, I haven’t. What’s it about?<p class="message sent">It’s a leadership training program for junior employees. I’m thinking about applying for it. Are you?<p class=message>I hadn’t heard about it, but it sounds interesting. I might look into it as well. Do you know when the application deadline is?<p class="message sent">I think it’s at the end of the month. We should definitely apply if we’re interested.<p class=message>Yeah, we should. It would be a great opportunity to learn and develop our skills.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Plus, it would look great on our resumes.<p class=message>Definitely. Speaking of resumes, have you heard back from any of the job applications you submitted?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I had an interview last week and I’m waiting to hear back now.<p class=message>That’s great news! I’ll keep my fingers crossed for you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I appreciate it. Speaking of job applications, how’s yours going?<p class=message>It’s going okay. I’m still waiting to hear back from a few places. It’s a tough job market out there.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it definitely is. But you’ve got a great resume, so I’m sure you’ll find something soon.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I really appreciate your support.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ba7221ef-9792-4c5d-b213-00151fef5420.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
