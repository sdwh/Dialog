I heard you were in the police station for questioning?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I got caught breaking the law. Officer A was questioning me. It was such a thrilling experience.<p class=message>Thrilling? That sounds like you're enjoying getting caught.<p class="message sent">No no, I didn't mean it like that. I meant it was an exciting experience to be in the police station and be questioned like a real criminal.<p class=message>Ha! I know what you mean. It's like being in a movie scene, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Exactly! And Officer A was like a real-life detective, asking all these questions and trying to piece together the evidence. It was like I was in a crime TV show.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Did you manage to keep a poker face or did you break down and confess to all your crimes?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Of course, I kept a poker face. No way was I going to confess to anything. But it was a bit nerve-wracking when they asked me some really difficult questions.<p class=message>Yeah, it can be scary, but the good thing is that you were only being questioned, not arrested. So, what did you tell Officer A?<p class="message sent">Oh, just that I was innocent and that it was all a misunderstanding. But I think Officer A saw right through me, he probably knew I was lying.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, I'm glad you're out now, safe and sound. But next time, try not to break the law, okay?<p class="message sent">(smirks) Yeah, yeah, I'll try my best. But honestly, it was fun being in the police station. Maybe I should become a detective, what do you think?<p class=message>(jokes) Oh definitely, you'd make a great detective. But with your record, you'd probably end up on the other side of the law! (laughs)<p class="message sent">(rolls their eyes) Hey, I'm trying to turn over a new leaf here!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=14da23c6-c7d7-4533-bc7d-79c0bfa811d2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
