It's about keeping information secure, right?<p class=message>Great! You're already a pro! But did you know it's also about ensuring the confidentiality of your secret recipe for grandma's famous chocolate chip cookies?<p class="message sent">Haha! I see where you're going with this. ISO 27001 Confidentiality is not just for big companies with valuable data, it's also for small businesses and personal information, like cookies.<p class=message>Exactly! We all have something worth protecting. And did you know that ISO 27001 also helps prevent data breaches and cyber attacks?<p class="message sent">That's important. I don't want hackers getting their hands on my secret cookie recipe.<p class=message>And I don't want them to get their hands on my high school photos either. ISO 27001 is all about keeping our information safe, no matter how big or small.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Plus, following the standard also shows our clients and customers that we take their security seriously.<p class=message>It's a win-win situation. We get to protect our information and gain trust from our stakeholders.<p class="message sent">And who doesn't like to be trusted? It's like getting the blue ribbon at a county fair for our security measures.<p class=message>Haha! I love that analogy. So, let's get cracking and start implementing ISO 27001 Confidentiality in our workplace and personal lives.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Our cookies and memories will be safe and sound.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b14633e-62cd-4908-a306-56cb3e95bfad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
