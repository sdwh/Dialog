Looks like another busy day at Maxwell Food Centre.<p class="message sent">It sure is, A! But I don't mind being busy when I get to serve up fresh and tasty soy milk.<p class=message>And I love seeing the happy faces of customers enjoying my authentic Singaporean chicken rice.<p class="message sent">That's so true! Speaking of which, I need to order my own breakfast. Can I have a serving of chicken rice and a side of sambal chili, please?<p class=message>Coming right up, B! And what can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">I'll have a hot soy milk, please. Extra frothy, if possible.<p class=message>Absolutely, B! It's always a pleasure to make your soy milk just the way you like it.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! So, have you had any unusual requests from customers lately?<p class=message>Well, yesterday I had a customer who asked for extra chicken skin on his rice. He said it's his guilty pleasure!<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's hilarious! I love it when customers get creative with their orders.<p class=message>Me too, B. It keeps things interesting. Ah, here's your chicken rice and chili. Enjoy!<p class="message sent">Mmm, this is amazing as always. And my soy milk is perfect. Thanks, A!<p class=message>You're welcome, B! It's great to work alongside someone who takes pride in their food as much as I do.<p class="message sent">Agreed, A. Here's to a busy yet satisfying day serving up the best breakfast in Maxwell!<p class=message>Cheers, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3f1b310a-2cb2-4a52-945d-15fd4ab4bcb9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
