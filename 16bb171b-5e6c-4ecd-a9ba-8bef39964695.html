How's the training going?<p class="message sent">It's been fantastic! I'm learning so much about Okinawan cuisine and beverages.<p class=message>That's great to hear! What's your favorite dish or drink so far?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough one. I really enjoyed learning how to make Okinawan-style soba noodles and the traditional awamori liquor.<p class=message>Wow, those sound amazing! Do you think we can incorporate those into our menu back at the restaurant?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I think our customers would love to try something new and unique. I could even teach the staff how to make them.<p class=message>Perfect! I can't wait to see what you come up with. Speaking of, did you learn any interesting stories or history behind the food and drinks?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. I learned that the Okinawan soba noodles were originally eaten by royalty and that awamori is distilled from Thai rice and is even called "island sake."<p class=message>Interesting! So not only are we adding new items to our menu, but we're also teaching our customers some cultural history.<p class="message sent">Yes, exactly. It's a win-win situation. Plus, I'm having so much fun learning all of this.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear it. And speaking of fun, have you had any free time to explore Okinawa?<p class="message sent">Yes, a little bit. I went to a beautiful beach with crystal-clear water and even saw some sea turtles.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like an amazing experience. Our customers might even appreciate some beach-inspired cocktails after hearing about that.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'm always up for brainstorming new ideas for our menu.<p class=message>That's excellent. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to seeing what you bring back to the restaurant.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=16b401c9-286d-48fc-9fd1-1681acd30b3a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
