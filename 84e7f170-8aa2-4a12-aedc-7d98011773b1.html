Do you see it?"<p class="message sent">"Yes, Grandpa! Let's see if we can catch it!"<p class=message>"Catch it? No, no. We're just here to watch and enjoy the scenery."<p class="message sent">"But Grandpa, I want to have a squirrel as a pet!"<p class=message>"I don't think it would be fair to keep a wild animal in a cage, B. They are meant to be free."<p class="message sent">"Hmm, I guess you're right. But maybe we can feed it some nuts?"<p class=message>"That's a good idea! Here, let's toss some over there by the tree."<p class="message sent">"Look, Grandpa! There's a group of ducks in the pond. Can we go feed them too?"<p class=message>"Sure, let's go get some bread to feed them. Remember to be gentle and not scare them away."<p class="message sent">"I won't! Look, they're coming towards us already!"<p class=message>"Ha, looks like they're not shy at all today. Maybe they're used to getting fed by kind-hearted people like us."<p class="message sent">"Grandpa, I'm so happy we're spending time together like this. I love you."<p class=message>"I love you too, B. It's important to make memories together and appreciate the simple things in life."<p class="message sent">"Like feeding ducks and watching squirrels?"<p class=message>"Yes, exactly like that. And who knows, maybe we'll see something else interesting before we head back home."<p class="message sent">"I hope so!
