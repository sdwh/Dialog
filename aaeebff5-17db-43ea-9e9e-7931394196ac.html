Which book would you recommend?<p class=message>I highly recommend The Shining. The characters are so well developed and the plot is incredibly eerie.<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe I'll give it a try. Have you ever read anything by J.K. Rowling?<p class=message>Of course!

Have you read anything else by Coelho?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've also read Veronika Decides to Die. It's another thought-provoking story that makes you question the meaning of life.<p class=message>Interesting. I'll definitely add that to my reading list as well. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! What other books are on your reading list for this year?<p class=message>I'm planning on reading Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky and The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.
