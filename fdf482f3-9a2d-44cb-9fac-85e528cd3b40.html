Just keeping busy with network maintenance and security checks.<p class=message>Ah, sounds like a never-ending job. What's your take on managing network risks?<p class="message sent">It's all about being proactive and staying on top of potential threats. Regular vulnerability assessments are key.<p class=message>Definitely. And how do you handle insider threats?<p class="message sent">We have strict access controls in place, as well as monitoring for any unusual activity.<p class=message>That's smart. Speaking of security, did you hear about the time a hacker broke into an art museum's network and demanded a ransom for the return of their stolen paintings?<p class="message sent">No way! That's crazy.<p class=message>Yeah, luckily the museum had good backup procedures in place and they were able to recover the data without paying the ransom.<p class="message sent">That's a relief. It's always a good idea to have a disaster recovery plan.<p class=message>Agreed. On a lighter note, have you tried our new coffee machine? It's the real deal.<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard good things. Can't wait to give it a try.<p class=message>You won't be disappointed. Well, I better get back to monitoring our network. Keep up the good work, B.<p class="message sent">Will do. See you later, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fdf301dc-5f4d-46af-981d-2ac64af9c8fc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
