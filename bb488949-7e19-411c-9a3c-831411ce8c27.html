I'm excited to learn some traditional seafood recipes from Tasmania.<p class="message sent">Welcome! I'm happy to have you here. What kind of seafood do you like to cook?<p class=message>I mostly catch fish like salmon, trout, and cod. But I'm open to learning new recipes with other types of seafood.<p class="message sent">Great, we have a lot of options! Today we'll focus on abalone and mussels. Did you know abalone is considered a delicacy here?<p class=message>Really? I've never cooked or tasted abalone before. How do you prepare it?<p class="message sent">We'll steam it with some soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. It's simple but delicious. And for the mussels, we'll put them in a tomato-based sauce with white wine, onions, and herbs.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! I can't wait to learn about the process.<p class="message sent">First, let's clean the abalone and remove the tough parts. Then we'll slice it thinly and marinate it for an hour in the soy sauce mixture.<p class=message>Okay, got it. And for the mussels, do we need to scrub them before cooking?<p class="message sent">Yes, we need to clean them thoroughly under running water and remove any beards. Don't forget to discard any that are already open.<p class=message>Thanks for the tips. I'm learning so much already!<p class="message sent">Cooking seafood isn't hard as long as you have fresh ingredients and some simple flavorings. Just let the natural flavors shine.<p class=message>It sounds like a fun challenge. I can't wait to impress my friends with some new recipes!<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And don't forget to pair the seafood with a nice glass of local wine. It's the perfect complement to a delicious meal.<p class=message>Awesome, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks again for the great lesson. Can't wait to try making these recipes at home!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bb46634d-46cb-43de-b66e-1e23679aaec0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
