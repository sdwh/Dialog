Can I help you with anything today?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! My baby has been coughing for a few days now, and I'm not sure what medication to give her.<p class=message>I see. How old is your baby?<p class="message sent">She's 6 months old.<p class=message>Alright. For babies under 6 months, it's best to consult a pediatrician first. But for a 6-month-old, we have some safe and effective cough medicine.<p class="message sent">Great! What should I look for in the medicine?<p class=message>You should choose a cough syrup that doesn't contain any alcohol, and that is safe for infants. Also, make sure the dosage instructions are clear.<p class="message sent">Okay. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Sure. You could try this brand. It's safe and effective for infants, and it has natural ingredients that can help soothe your baby's cough.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! Can I also get some advice for teething pain? I heard that there are some medications for that.<p class=message>Yes, we have some teething gels or drops that can help relieve the pain. Just make sure to read the instructions carefully and avoid giving your baby too much.<p class="message sent">Alright, thank you again for your help! You've been very informative.<p class=message>You're welcome! It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to medication for babies. Have a great day, ma'am!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e7bae6ab-fd84-4b80-8b43-4ae7ed78bb70.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
