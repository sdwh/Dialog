I just need to compile the findings and recommendations section.<p class="message received message-content">Great, let's hope it doesn't end up being too long or too complicated.<p class="message sent message-content">Ha! Yeah, I definitely don't want to put anyone to sleep before they even get to the recommendations.<p class="message received message-content">That's for sure. It would be pretty funny if the report ended up being longer than the actual audit.<p class="message sent message-content">Hey, don't even joke about that. I'm pretty sure I've seen some reports that fit that description.<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, unfortunately that's not too hard to believe. But hey, as long as we make our report clear and concise, we should be good to go.<p class="message sent message-content">Agreed. And who knows, maybe our recommendations will lead to some positive changes for the company.<p class="message received message-content">That's the goal. But if not, at least we can say we did our part and gave them some valuable feedback.<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely. And if all else fails, we can always slip in a good joke or two to lighten the mood.<p class="message received message-content">Haha, that's a solid backup plan. Alright, let's get back to work and finish up this report.<p class="message sent message-content">Roger that.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0724ae5b-e4b9-4ea2-aedb-3602fd1d05a1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
