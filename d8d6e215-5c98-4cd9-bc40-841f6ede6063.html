What about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. I think we should talk about the progress we've made on the project.<p class="message sent">Of course. What do you want to start with?<p class=message>Well, let's start with the good news. We've completed all the testing on the first phase, and everything is working as expected.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. So, what's next?<p class=message>We need to start working on the second phase, but first, we need to coordinate with the design team as they'd be giving us the required visual elements.<p class="message sent">No problem. I've already talked to them, and they're ready to share their designs.<p class=message>That's great. How about the code review process?<p class="message sent">It's going smoothly, but it's taking some time as we want to be thorough. But we're on track.<p class=message>That's good to know. Have you had any code conflicts that you need my help to resolve?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but we may have some in the upcoming days. It's part of the process.<p class=message>Sounds good. Let me know if you need any assistance.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And, by the way, have you tried the new burger place across the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. How is it?<p class="message sent">It's amazing. I highly recommend it.<p class=message>Thanks. I'll check that out. Anything else on your mind?<p class="message sent">Not really. Just excited to see our hard work come to life.<p class=message>Same here. We're doing great, keep up the good work.<p class="message sent">Will do!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d8d27c0b-0c3e-4e65-ab23-2ef0e8f9eec1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
