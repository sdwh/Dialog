I am a tea merchant from Guangdong, nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi there, pleasure to meet you. I own this tea house in Meizhou. Would you like to try some of our local teas?<p class=message>Yes, please! I am always excited to try new varieties. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">We have a special local tea called "Meizhou Mao Feng," it is famous for its tender buds and leaves. Want me to brew some for you?<p class=message>That sounds perfect! I'll take some of that Mao Feng tea. How should it be prepared?<p class="message sent">We'll use a gaiwan for brewing. First, we rinse the tea leaves with hot water, then we brew it for about 1-2 minutes.<p class=message>Interesting. How does the flavor profile compare to other green teas?<p class="message sent">The Mao Feng tea is sweet and mellow with a fresh floral aroma. It's definitely worth a try!<p class=message>Wow, you're right! It has a unique taste that I haven't tasted before. What other local teas do you suggest?<p class="message sent">If you prefer a stronger taste, I can recommend trying the "Wuyi rock tea" or the "Pu-erh tea." These teas are both rich and flavorful.<p class=message>I would love to taste those as well. Can you brew some up for me?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, I'll prepare them both for you. I think you'll love the earthy and robust flavor of the Pu-erh tea.<p class=message>Mmm, these teas are fantastic! I never realized just how much variety there is in tea.<p class="message sent">Definitely! We take pride in offering a wide selection of teas in our shop, and love recommending new blends to our customers.<p class=message>Well, I am certainly impressed. Thank you for introducing me to these wonderful teas. I'll be sure to return soon!<p class="message sent">It's our pleasure to have you come back and enjoy more of our teas. Thank you for visiting and happy tea drinking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=74d7676d-d77a-4aef-bd8d-a1c01db3773a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
