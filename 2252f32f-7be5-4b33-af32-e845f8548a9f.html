So, I was thinking, maybe we should try and become soccer players too.<p class="message sent">(laughs) And how do you propose we do that? Neither of us has ever played soccer before.<p class=message>Well, we could start practicing and maybe join the school team. Who knows, maybe we have some hidden talent.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that might actually be a good idea. But we would need to find a coach or someone to teach us.<p class=message>I heard that the older students on the team sometimes volunteer to train new recruits. Maybe we could ask them for help.<p class="message sent">Great idea. But we also need to make sure we have the right gear and equipment, like cleats and shin guards.<p class=message>Good point. And we should also start with some basic conditioning, like running and doing exercises to improve our footwork.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And if we work hard enough, maybe we’ll even make it onto the starting team and impress the ladies.<p class=message>(laughs) That’s the spirit! Who knows, maybe we’ll even become soccer stars and have our names up in lights.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. But I’m definitely up for the challenge. Let’s do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2250470e-841d-4323-83e6-89464bf71aa7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
