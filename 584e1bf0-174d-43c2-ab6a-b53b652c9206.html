But I'm really excited to learn how to make the local specialties like Hakata-style ramen and grilled fish.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Our restaurant specializes in both of those dishes, so you'll definitely get some hands-on experience here.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to learn. Do you have any tips for grilling the perfect fish?<p class=message>Well, one tip is to make sure the fish is properly cleaned and scaled before grilling. And timing is key, so make sure you don't leave it on the grill for too long or it'll become dry.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice. Speaking of timing, how long does it usually take to prepare Hakata-style ramen?<p class=message>It usually takes a few hours to make the broth, and then you need to boil the noodles separately. But the end result is worth the effort.<p class="message sent">I'm sure it is. I've heard the broth is the most important part of the dish.<p class=message>Absolutely, the broth is what makes it so flavorful. We use a special blend of pork bones and other ingredients to create a rich and savory broth.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. I can't wait to try it.<p class=message>You know what else is amazing? The local sake here in Fukuoka. We should grab a bottle after work and relax.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan to me. Cheers to a successful day of learning and cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=584c4f24-8117-48af-82c7-6cc00dbdf66e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
