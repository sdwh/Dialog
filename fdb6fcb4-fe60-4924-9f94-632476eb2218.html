How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thank you for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. So, for today's lesson, we're going to talk about two precious stones - amethyst and jade.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about them?<p class=message>Sure. Let's start with amethyst. Did you know that amethyst was once believed to ward off drunkenness?<p class="message sent">No, I didn't know that. That's quite an interesting fact.<p class=message>Yes, it is. And it's also believed to have healing powers, especially when it comes to relieving headaches.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's amazing. What about jade?<p class=message>Jade has a rich history, especially in Chinese culture. It was once believed to have the power of immortality and was highly valued by royalty.<p class="message sent">That's really fascinating. I've also heard that jade is thought to bring good luck and protect its wearer from harm.<p class=message>Yes, that's another belief. In fact, Chinese warriors used to wear jade armor to protect themselves in battle.<p class="message sent">That's really cool. I had no idea that both of these stones had such interesting histories behind them.<p class=message>Yes, they do. And there's so much more to learn, too. Perhaps we can continue our discussion next time.<p class="message sent">Sounds great. Thank you for sharing these stories with me, A. I always enjoy learning new things in your class.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, B. I'm glad you found it interesting. Have a great day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fdb5fea0-4b23-404a-bec3-4eb68b637e3e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
