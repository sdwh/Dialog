I'm your tour guide, and today we'll be exploring the beautiful landmarks in this city. My name is Alicia and I'll be with you for the next 4 hours.<p class="message received message-content">Our first stop will be the iconic clock tower that dates back to the 16th century. It's a great spot to start and admire the city's history.<p class="message received message-content">Yes, it is! The legend goes that a young apprentice from the tower fell in love with the Lord Mayor's daughter and was executed for it. His ghost still wanders the clock tower looking for his love.<p class="message received message-content">The clock tower construction took over 20 years to complete. It's amazing to witness the amount of hard work that went into it.<p class="message received message-content">The clock tower is maintained twice a year. It's an intricate process to ensure it keeps ticking and chimes accurately.<p class="message received message-content">You can take a stroll around the local market, try some tasty food, or visit the art museums. The city has so much to offer, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.<p class="message received message-content">My pleasure, B. Don't hesitate to ask me anything. Now, let's head to our second stop, which is one of the largest cathedrals in Europe. It's going to be magnificent!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0d5b3065-296a-406e-9ee1-011ce4830e62.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
