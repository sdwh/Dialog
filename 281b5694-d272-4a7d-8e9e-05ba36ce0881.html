How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi, Course Designer A. I'm doing pretty well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks! So, let's get down to business - I wanted to talk to you about selecting teaching materials for your class.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, I'm always looking for new materials to use.<p class=message>Well, I've been doing some research on student engagement, and it turns out that using videos is a great way to get students excited about learning.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Do you have any particular videos in mind?<p class=message>Definitely! There's a really cool TED talk that I think your students would love - it's about how technology is changing the way we communicate.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! I think my students would really benefit from watching something like that.<p class=message>Great! And I also found a really funny video that I think would be perfect for introducing idioms - it's called "English Idioms Illustrated."<p class="message sent">Ha! That sounds like a lot of fun. I'm sure my students would get a kick out of it.<p class=message>And finally, I found a great article about the benefits of learning a second language. It's from a reputable source and has some really interesting statistics.<p class="message sent">I'm always looking for ways to motivate my students to keep learning, so that sounds like a great resource.<p class=message>Perfect! I'll get all of these materials together and send them over to you so you can start incorporating them into your lessons.<p class="message sent">Thanks so much, Course Designer A! I really appreciate your help and your ability to find engaging materials.<p class=message>No problem, Teacher B! That's what I'm here for. Let me know if you need anything else in the future.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=281abd10-df9b-4097-acb7-3ca4e4f0dffc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
