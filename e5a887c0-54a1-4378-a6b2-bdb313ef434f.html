How's it going with the noodle making today, Chef?<p class="message sent">Hi, Boss! Everything's going great. The dough has rested overnight and I'm ready to start making some fresh noodles!<p class=message>That's wonderful to hear. I can't wait to taste them. What kind of noodles do you plan on making today?<p class="message sent">Today, we'll start with our signature hand-pulled noodles, and maybe we'll try some knife-cut noodles later.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. And how about the soup broth? Is it ready to go?<p class="message sent">Almost there, Boss. We're simmering it slowly to extract all the flavors. We're using a mix of beef bones and chicken, so it should be a nice balance.<p class=message>Great job, Chef. You always put so much care into your cooking. That's why our customers keep coming back.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Boss. It's my passion to make good food, and I'm glad to be able to share it with others.<p class=message>So, tell me, Chef. What's your secret to making perfect noodle dough?<p class="message sent">Well, Boss, it's all about the right proportion of flour, water, and salt. And of course, the rest period is crucial too.<p class=message>I see. And how about the pulling technique? That looks very challenging to me.<p class="message sent">It does require some practice, but it's mostly about using the right movement with your hands and arms. It's like dancing with the dough!<p class=message>Ha ha, I can imagine that. I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer, but I'm definitely a noodle lover. Keep up the good work, Chef!<p class="message sent">Will do, Boss. And don't worry, we'll have you dancing with the noodles in no time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e5a62920-c3c3-46c8-9a84-0b891d0ec62b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
