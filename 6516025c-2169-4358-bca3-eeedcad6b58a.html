Going down the slide backward like that!<p class="message sent">Thanks, Dad! It's way more fun than going down frontwards.<p class=message>Well, just be careful not to hurt yourself. The last thing we need is a trip to the ER.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, Dad. I've done this a million times before.<p class=message>Alright, I'll trust you on that. Hey, have you tried going down with your eyes closed yet?<p class="message sent">No, is that even possible?<p class=message>Sure it is! You just have to trust that the slide will take you where you need to go.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll give it a try. Here goes nothing!<p class="message sent">That was so cool, Dad! I felt like I was flying!<p class=message>See, I told you it was fun! What do you want to try next? Maybe hang upside down from the monkey bars?<p class="message sent">(Laughs) Let's save that for another day. I think I've had enough excitement for now.<p class=message>Alright, let's head over to the swings then. But I'm warning you, I'm still the king of the swing set.<p class="message sent">Oh please, Dad. I have a few tricks up my sleeve too. Let's see who can go the highest!<p class=message>Game on, kiddo!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6511e8e1-44fe-4e37-bb6c-97fb171fa188.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
