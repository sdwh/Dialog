Welcome to our restaurant! I'm the manager, what can I do for you?<p class="message sent">Good evening, sir! I'm your server tonight. My name is Jack. May I recommend some dishes for you?<p class=message>Of course, Jack! How about the roasted duck breast with orange confit and truffle sauce?<p class="message sent">Excellent choice, sir! It pairs well with a glass of bubbly champagne. Perhaps a bottle of Dom Perignon?<p class=message>Yes, that's a fantastic suggestion. How about another appetizer?<p class="message sent">Have you ever tried our seared scallops with pea puree and bacon bits? It's one of our best-sellers.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. Let's have that as well. How about the wine?<p class="message sent">As for wine, I would recommend a Pinot Noir from Burgundy. It has a silky texture and a fruity aroma that goes well with scallops.<p class=message>You certainly know a lot about wine. Maybe we should just let you choose the wine for us!<p class="message sent">Thank you very much, sir! I'll make sure you won't be disappointed.<p class=message>By the way, Jack, how did you become a waiter?<p class="message sent">Well, sir, I used to be a chef. But I found out that I'm more interested in providing excellent service to customers.<p class=message>That's great to hear. You're doing a fantastic job tonight.<p class="message sent">I appreciate that, sir. Is there anything else I could help you with?<p class=message>Just one more thing, Jack. What's your favorite dish in this restaurant?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely the beef Wellington, sir. It's a classic dish that we cook to perfection here.<p class=message>We'll have to try that next time we come back. Thank you, Jack! You've been a great help.<p class="message sent">Thank you, sir! It was my pleasure to serve you tonight. Please don't hesitate to call on me for any assistance you need. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=89ada185-0667-40e6-b995-4096169d24ff.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
