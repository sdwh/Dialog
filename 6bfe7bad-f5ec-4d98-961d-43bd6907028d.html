I know you’re leaving for your studies abroad soon, so I thought I’d give you something to remember me by.<p class="message sent">Oh, is it a present? You shouldn't have!<p class=message>Don’t worry, it’s just a small token of my appreciation for the time we’ve spent together. Here it is!<p class="message sent">Wow, it’s a pocket watch! This is so cool, thank you! It's really pretty too. I'll always carry this around with me.<p class=message>I picked it out just for you. It looks like it has some vintage charm to it, and it suits your style.<p class="message sent">You’re right, it’s perfect. Now I can keep track of the time, and I'll have a fond memory of us every time I look at it.<p class=message>I hope this watch will remind you of all the good times we had together.<p class="message sent">It definitely will. And who knows? Maybe it’ll bring me good luck while I'm abroad. I have a feeling this watch will be my lucky charm.<p class=message>I'm glad you like it. Speaking of which, where are you planning to study?<p class="message sent">I've decided to take my studies in the UK, in a small town called Bath.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds fantastic! You'll have to take lots of pictures and share your experiences with me when you come back.<p class="message sent">Of course, absolutely! And maybe I'll get you something cool too when I come back.<p class=message>That would be great, but just your presence would be enough for me. Remember to study hard and have fun too!<p class="message sent">I will, thank you so much for everything. You’ve been such an amazing friend to me.<p class=message>Same goes for you, B. I'll miss you a lot while you're gone, but I'm happy for you and the opportunities that await you.<p class="message sent">Thank you again, A. This watch really means a lot to me, and I'll cherish it always.<p class=message>You're welcome, B.
