How is the bread coming along today, B?<p class="message sent">Hello! It's going great, thanks for asking. The croissants are extra flaky today.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear. And how about you, have any interesting coffee orders this morning?<p class="message sent">Oh, you wouldn't believe it! Someone came in and ordered a decaf espresso with a shot of lavender syrup.<p class=message>Lavender syrup? That sounds unique. Did they enjoy it?<p class="message sent">They did! They said it was a nice change from their usual order. What about you, any weird drink requests?<p class=message>Well, someone asked for a cappuccino with almond milk and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Not too out of the ordinary, but still different.<p class="message sent">It's always exciting to try out new drink combinations. Speaking of which, have you tried the pain au chocolat with our espresso?<p class=message>Actually, I haven't. Is it a good pairing?<p class="message sent">It's heaven! The rich chocolate goes so well with the espresso's bitterness.<p class=message>I'll have to try that myself later. But for now, I need to get these macchiatos to our table of regulars.<p class="message sent">No problem, I'll make sure to keep up with the bread demand.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. Oh, and make sure to save a baguette for me too!<p class="message sent">Haha, will do. Have a great morning, A!<p class=message>You too, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b0747426-2aa2-46dd-915a-5be01343876b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
