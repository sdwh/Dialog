I'm really excited to be opening this new fast food restaurant with you, B. I think it's going to be a huge success.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We're going to have the best burgers in town. Speaking of which, let's talk about the ingredients we'll be using.<p class=message>Right. We've got the classic lettuce, onion, and tomato. Those are a must-have.<p class="message sent">Of course. And we'll need some delicious melted cheese on top.<p class=message>Definitely, but what about the hamburger patty itself?<p class="message sent">We'll be using 100% USDA grade A beef. Nothing but the best for our customers.<p class=message>Sounds great. And what about pickles?<p class="message sent">Personally, I love pickles on my burgers, so I think we should offer them as an option.<p class=message>Excellent idea. We'll be sure to include them on the menu. Do you think we should have any other toppings?<p class="message sent">How about bacon? It's a classic addition to any burger.<p class=message>That's a great idea! And maybe we could also offer a veggie burger option for our vegetarian customers.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We want to make sure everyone can enjoy our burgers. And speaking of which, what about our sauces?<p class=message>We'll definitely have ketchup and mustard as the basics, but how about adding a special sauce to our burgers to set us apart?<p class="message sent">Love it! Maybe a secret recipe that only we know about.<p class=message>That's perfect. I'm getting hungry just talking about it.<p class="message sent">Me too. I think we've got the perfect recipe for success here. Let's work hard and make sure we get our burgers just right.<p class=message>Agree! I canâ€™t wait to see the reaction from our first customers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d3b4c28c-3e7f-47d1-8a73-a0c2bfed3311.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
