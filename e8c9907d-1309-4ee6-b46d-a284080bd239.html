Are you ready for some fruit picking fun today?<p class="message sent">Hi, thanks for having me! Yes, I'm excited to try my hand at picking some fresh fruit.<p class=message>Excellent! Our orchard is full of ripe apples, peaches, and nectarines for you to choose from.<p class="message sent">That all sounds delicious. How do I know when the fruit is ready to be picked?<p class=message>Just look for the ones with bright colors and a slight give when you gently squeeze them. Trust me, you'll know when you find the perfect one!<p class="message sent">(laughs) I hope I don't end up picking all the bad ones.<p class=message>No worries, even the not-so-good ones are great for making jams or pies. Waste not, want not!<p class="message sent">(smiles) That's a good attitude to have. Do you have any tips for making the most of my fruit picking experience?<p class=message>Definitely wear comfortable clothes and shoes that you don't mind getting a little dirty. And don't forget to take breaks and enjoy the beautiful scenery around us!<p class="message sent">(nods) I'll keep that in mind. I'm also curious, what's your favorite fruit?<p class=message>Ooh, tough choice. But I have to say, there's nothing quite like biting into a crisp, juicy apple.<p class="message sent">I can't argue with that. (pauses) Thank you so much for sharing your farm with me today. It's been a lovely experience.<p class=message>Our pleasure, friend. And now you have some fresh fruit to take home and enjoy!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e8c7312c-7d6f-4b03-94ce-c2d05466ca9d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
