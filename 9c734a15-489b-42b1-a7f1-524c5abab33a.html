I'm excited to work with you. So, what should we create first, the Matcha mille crepes cake?<p class=message>Yes, let's start with the Matcha mille crepes cake. I'll prepare the mille crepes, and you can start making some hand drip coffee.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. By the way, I love how you brought your own special matcha powder all the way from Japan.<p class=message>Yes, I wanted to share the best quality matcha powder with you for the perfect taste. Have you ever tried this before?<p class="message sent">Actually, this is my first time. I've heard so much about the health benefits of matcha, and I'm excited to try it.<p class=message>Yes, matcha is not only healthy but also has a unique flavor profile. While I am finishing up the cake, can you tell me more about your coffee experience?<p class="message sent">Sure, I've been making coffee for more than five years now. And I keep learning about new techniques and beans to achieve the perfect cup.<p class=message>That's impressive! I'm quite sure that our cake and coffee combination will be a hit with our customers.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Everyone loves a good matcha cake and a hot cup of coffee. We could even add some latte art on top of our coffee.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Maybe we could create a leaf or heart shape, what do you think?<p class="message sent">I think that sounds perfect. Let's do it! We can make a great team together, and our customers are going to be very happy with our delicious specialties.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9c6e0fba-4baa-434a-bcd2-5ce227367f76.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
