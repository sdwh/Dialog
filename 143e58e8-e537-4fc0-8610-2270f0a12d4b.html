I'm excited to see the new café taking shape here in Luzern.<p class="message sent">Morning, A! Yes, it's been a lot of work, but I'm hoping we can make this place special.<p class=message>I have a few ideas that might set us apart. For example, I recently learned how to make latte art!<p class="message sent">That's great, A! I've heard people love Instagramming fancy drinks. Can you make a coffee that looks like a unicorn?<p class=message>Yes, I can! And I can make one that looks like a panda too. But I think we should also focus on the quality of our coffee, not just the looks.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We have some amazing local roasters, like Rösterei Wildbach. Have you tried their beans?<p class=message>Yes, I have! They have a really unique flavor. But I also want to make sure we have some interesting food options to go with the coffee.<p class="message sent">What do you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, how about a breakfast board with artisanal bread, Swiss cheese, and smoked salmon? And for lunch, we could do open-faced sandwiches with local meats and veggies.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds amazing! And we'll have to make sure to have some Swiss chocolate on hand for our guests.<p class=message>Definitely. I have a friend who makes her own chocolate truffles. Maybe we can sell them in the café?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We should also look into hosting coffee tastings or even barista workshops down the line.<p class=message>Yes, let's make this a hub for coffee lovers! I think with our passion and creativity, we can really make this place thrive.<p class="message sent">Agreed, A. I'm excited to start serving up some delicious coffee and food here. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=143ada6e-7d0d-415c-949d-9a5a13168bd1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
