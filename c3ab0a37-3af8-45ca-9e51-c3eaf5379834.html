How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">I'm feeling a little nervous. I've never been to the hospital before.<p class=message>Don't worry, B. We're just going to do a routine checkup today. Is there anything specific that's bothering you?<p class="message sent">Well, my stomach has been hurting a bit lately.<p class=message>Okay, we'll take a closer look at that. Have you been eating anything spicy or greasy recently?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I was on a hot sauce kick for a while there.<p class=message>Ah, that could be the cause of your stomach pains. But we'll run some tests just to be sure.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Nurse A. You're very reassuring.<p class=message>No problem, B. I'm here to make sure you're well taken care of. Now, let's check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs.<p class="message sent">Okay, sounds good.<p class=message>Your blood pressure is normal, and your heart and lungs sound great. Now, let's have a look at your stomach.<p class="message sent">*slightly nervous*<p class=message>Don't worry, B. I'll be gentle. *lifts shirt and starts examining stomach* Hmm, it does feel a little tender here. I'm going to recommend some over-the-counter medication for you, and we'll follow up in a few days to see how you're doing.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Nurse A. You're so kind and patient.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, B. It's important to me that my patients feel comfortable and well taken care of. Do you have any other concerns or questions?<p class="message sent">No, I think that's all. Thank you for explaining everything to me.<p class=message>You're welcome, B.
