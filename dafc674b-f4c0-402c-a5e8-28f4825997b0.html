How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I work for a car rental company and I need to drop off some cars here. Can you tell me where I should go?<p class=message>Absolutely. Our car rental return area is just over there, past the shuttle bus stop. You can't miss it.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the directions. While we're at it, would you mind sharing some insights on how our customers can rent a car from your lot?<p class=message>Sure thing! Once they arrive at the airport, they can follow the signs to the car rental area, which is located in the terminal. From there, they can choose a rental car company and go through the booking process.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that sounds easy enough. What documents do they need to prepare?<p class=message>They'll need a valid driver's license, a credit card, and a proof of insurance. It's also helpful if they have an itinerary or reservation number.<p class="message sent">Got it, thanks for clarifying that. Do you have any tips for our customers to make their rental experience smoother?<p class=message>Yes! It's always a good idea for them to come prepared with any questions they may have and to review their rental contract carefully before signing.<p class="message sent">Excellent advice. Thanks for your help, A. You're a real pro at your job!<p class=message>Thank you, B. It's always a pleasure to assist our valued customers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=daf322cd-e401-4349-91d7-7b0b6a3eda32.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
