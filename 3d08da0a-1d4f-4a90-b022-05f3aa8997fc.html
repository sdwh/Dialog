How have you been?<p class="message sent">Good to see you too, A! Can't complain, the market's been treating us well. How about you?<p class=message>Not bad, not bad. I've been keeping an eye on the news, trying to stay up to date with everything. So, how's our portfolio doing?<p class="message sent">We've seen some steady growth over the past few months, but I think there are some sectors we could definitely expand into. Have you thought about renewable energy? It's a hot topic these days.<p class=message>Definitely something to consider. Speaking of hot topics, have you heard about that new unicorn startup? Everyone's raving about it.<p class="message sent">Ah yes, I have. But sometimes those unicorn companies can be risky investments. It's important to weigh the pros and cons.<p class=message>That's true. So, what do you recommend we do?<p class="message sent">Right now, I think our best bet is to continue diversifying our portfolio with reliable, established companies. We don't want to put all our eggs in one basket.<p class=message>I agree. It's important to have a balance. By the way, have you tried that new caf√© down the street? I heard their coffee is amazing.<p class="message sent">I actually have been meaning to check it out. Maybe we should go for a coffee break after this meeting and try it out.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! It's always good to take a break and relax a bit.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3d071b44-dade-495b-ad26-78f18f7cbf7a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
