I was just reviewing our inventory report and noticed that we have a surplus of stamps.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Yes, I saw that too. It seems we have accumulated quite a bit over the years.<p class=message>Yes, and I was thinking, rather than letting them go to waste, we could perhaps donate them to a school or charity.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea, A. It's a small gesture that would help those in need.<p class=message>Exactly. Plus, it's a good way to show the community that we care about their well-being.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'll start researching local organizations that could benefit from this donation.<p class=message>Perfect. And while we're at it, we could also declutter our supply closet and donate any other extra office supplies.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, A. We'll be doing our part in reducing waste and contributing to a good cause.<p class=message>Absolutely, B. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved.<p class="message sent">Right. And who knows, this could be the start of a company-wide initiative to give back to the community.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Let's set an example for others to follow.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=12224f07-9eb7-4e93-9717-bf2f039a644a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
