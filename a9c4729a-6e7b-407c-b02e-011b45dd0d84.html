They're quick and easy to make!<p class=message>Sounds great to me. Do you have any recipe in mind?<p class="message sent">Sure do! Let me get the ingredients ready, and we can start baking.<p class=message>Alright, but be careful with those eggs. We don't need to have any accidents in the kitchen.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, Mom. I got this covered.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. So, have you been practicing your frosting skills?<p class="message sent">Yes, and I think I have gotten better at it. Want to see?<p class=message>Absolutely! Go ahead and show me your skills, little master.<p class="message sent">Alright, here it goes. *proceeds to frost the cupcakes*<p class=message>Wow, those look amazing! I'm so proud of you, B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Mom. Can we eat them now?<p class=message>Yes, but remember to let them cool down first. We don't want to burn our tongues.<p class="message sent">Oh, right. Patience, patience.<p class=message>*chuckles* Exactly. So, while we wait for the cupcakes to cool down, how was school today?<p class="message sent">It was good, but I'm glad that it's the weekend now. I need a break from all that studying.<p class=message>I hear you. Do you have any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I want to go to the park and ride my bike. What about you, Mom?<p class=message>I'm planning on catching up on some reading and maybe watching a movie.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a relaxing weekend ahead.<p class=message>Definitely. Now, let's enjoy our delicious cupcakes together.<p class="message sent">Yum!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a9c424a9-eec0-423a-b2ba-31bb1bca4f4d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
