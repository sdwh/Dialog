I'm thinking of taking a trip there.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been there a couple of times actually. It's a pretty amazing place.<p class=message>Oh really? Do you have any recommendations on what to do there?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out the Great Barrier Reef. It's truly breathtaking.<p class=message>Yeah, I was thinking about that. Do you have a specific company you recommend for tours?<p class="message sent">I went with Reef Experience and had a blast. They have a great staff and the boat is really nice.<p class=message>Awesome, thanks for the tip. What else should I see?<p class="message sent">You should also check out Kuranda, a rainforest village in the mountains. It's a really unique experience.<p class=message>Sounds cool! How do you get there?<p class="message sent">You can take the Kuranda Scenic Railway or the Skyrail Rainforest Cableway. Both are pretty amazing rides.<p class=message>I think I'll go with the cableway. It sounds like a really fun way to see the rainforest.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And make sure to go for a swim at Cairns Esplanade Lagoon. It's a great spot to cool off and relax.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. I love swimming. Any good restaurants you recommend?<p class="message sent">For a great seafood dinner, check out Ochre Restaurant. Their menu is full of interesting Australian dishes.<p class=message>Mmm, that sounds delicious. What about accommodation? Do you have any recommendations for hotels or hostels?<p class="message sent">I stayed at the Northern Greenhouse hostel and had a great experience. It's affordable and in a great location.<p class=message>Thank you so much for all the recommendations. I'm really excited for my trip now.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Let me know how it goes!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dfce4888-082b-4e2a-83b3-e5a4c413ce35.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
