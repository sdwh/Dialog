It's all about protecting sensitive information and ensuring it's kept private.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a pretty big deal. Who wouldn't want their information kept private?<p class=message>Exactly! Especially in this day and age where data breaches seem to happen left and right.<p class="message sent">So, what's your favorite thing about ISO 27001 Privacy?<p class=message>I think it's the fact that it helps organizations focus on their vulnerabilities and areas where they need to improve.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's interesting. Sounds like it's great for continual improvement.<p class=message>Absolutely! And it's not just for big corporations. Even small businesses can benefit from this certification.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. Hey, do you think ISO 27001 could help me keep my room clean and tidy?<p class=message>*laughs* Well, it might not be directly related, but it could definitely help with organization!<p class="message sent">That's true. Maybe I'll start with my room and work my way up to information security.<p class=message>Baby steps, right? *laughs* But seriously, it's never too early to start thinking about information security.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'll definitely look into it.
