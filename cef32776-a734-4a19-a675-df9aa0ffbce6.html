Good morning, I'm here for the interview for the cashier position.<p class="message sent">Good morning! Yes, that's right. Could you please tell me a little bit about your work experience in the hospitality industry?<p class=message>Sure! I previously worked at a coffee shop as a cashier, so I have experience handling cash, operating the cash register, and providing excellent customer service.<p class="message sent">Great! Being friendly and welcoming is very important for this job. Can you tell me how you handle difficult customers or situations?<p class=message>Of course! I always remain calm and try to understand their concerns. I empathize with the customer and do my best to resolve the issue to their satisfaction.<p class="message sent">That's a great approach. How do you handle busy periods or long queues?<p class=message>During busy periods, I try to work efficiently and prioritize tasks. I also communicate clearly with customers and let them know about wait times. This way, they feel informed and taken care of.<p class="message sent">Excellent. Can you share a time when you went above and beyond to provide excellent customer service?<p class=message>Yes, there was a customer who was looking for a particular coffee blend that we didn't have on the menu. I checked with my supervisor and found out that we could create the blend by mixing two of our current blends. It turned out to be a huge hit with the customer and they left very satisfied.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic! Finally, do you have any questions for me about the position or the hotel?<p class=message>Yes, I was wondering what the opportunities for growth and development are within the hotel?<p class="message sent">We have a strong commitment to employee growth and development, and we regularly offer training programs and opportunities for advancement within the company.<p class=message>That's great to hear.
