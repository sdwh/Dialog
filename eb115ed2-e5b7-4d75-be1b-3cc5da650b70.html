Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Hey, great to meet you too! I'm the front-end engineer on this team.<p class=message>So, what do you think we can do to improve the user experience on this website?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, we could simplify the navigation. It's a bit confusing right now.<p class=message>Yes, I agree. Maybe we could also make the buttons more prominent so users can easily find what they're looking for.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. And we should definitely make sure the site is responsive so it looks good on all devices.<p class=message>Definitely. We should also consider making the site faster. Slow load times are a major turn-off for users.<p class="message sent">That's true. And we could try using some animations or other visuals to make the site more engaging.<p class=message>Absolutely. We want users to stay on the site and explore all that it has to offer.<p class="message sent">Maybe we could also incorporate some customer reviews or testimonials to build trust with the audience.<p class=message>Good thinking. And we should make sure the site is ADA compliant so it's accessible to everyone.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's important to make sure everyone can use the site, regardless of their abilities.<p class=message>Well, it sounds like we have a lot of work to do, but I'm excited to get started.<p class="message sent">Same here! I think we can make some really positive changes to this site.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eb109e20-135e-4b9b-bdb1-e6f7bac0fe10.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
