I'm the chef for this workshop. Are you the photographer?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct! I'm excited to capture the beauty of Kyoto's traditional wagashi-making process.<p class=message>Excellent! Speaking of wagashi, have you worked with them before?<p class="message sent">Not exactly, but I've been to Japan before and I know they're delicate and artistic. I'm really curious to see how they're made.<p class=message>Well, you're in for a treat. We use traditional techniques and ingredients to make wagashi. It's always a visual delight.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! I brought my best camera, so I hope I can capture the beauty.<p class=message>I'm sure you will. So, let's get started. First, we'll make anko, a sweet bean paste.<p class="message sent">Fascinating! I guess the process for making wagashi is quite intricate.<p class=message>Indeed. You have to be careful with the proportions and timing. It's a bit like science and art combined.<p class="message sent">I like that! I'm intrigued by how creativity and precision go hand in hand.<p class=message>Absolutely. And the good news is that there's always room to experiment and innovate. That's why wagashi is never boring.<p class="message sent">I see. So, how long does it take to make one wagashi?<p class=message>It varies, but usually no more than 10-15 minutes. Sometimes, the decoration can take longer, because we use tiny cutters and brushes.<p class="message sent">I see. Do you have a favorite type of wagashi?<p class=message>Hmm, that's a tough one. I love all of them, but maybe sakura mochi, because it's so pretty and fragrant. What about you?<p class="message sent">Well, I haven't tried many, but I'm excited to taste them all! They all look so colorful and playful.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's heat the anko and start shaping the wagashi. Be sure to take some shots!<p class="message sent">You got it. This is going to make for a beautiful photo essay. Thank you for teaching me the art of wagashi, chef.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. And thank you for capturing the beauty of our work. Let's make some more magic!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bbe2d18e-83fc-4a2f-8cff-fffadb52a2a9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
