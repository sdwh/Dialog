Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.<p class="message sent">Hi, A! No problem at all, I'm happy to be here.<p class=message>So, tell me a little bit about yourself. What do you do for a living?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm actually a professional yo-yo performer. I travel around the world doing shows and competitions.<p class=message>Wow, that's really interesting! How did you get started with that?<p class="message sent">It's actually a funny story. When I was a kid, I found a yo-yo in a cereal box and started playing around with it. I got really good and eventually started entering contests.<p class=message>That's amazing! I've never been able to do more than get the yo-yo to come back up.<p class="message sent">It takes a lot of practice, but it's definitely worth it. Plus, it's a great conversation starter!<p class=message>I bet it is. So, what's your favorite trick to perform?<p class="message sent">Probably the "around the world" trick. It's a classic, but it gets a great reaction from the crowd.<p class=message>I can imagine! Have you ever had any mishaps during a performance?<p class="message sent">Oh, plenty. Once, I accidentally hit someone in the face with my yo-yo. Luckily, they were okay and we all had a good laugh about it.<p class=message>That's embarrassing, but it makes for a good story. So, what's next for you in your yo-yo career?<p class="message sent">I have a big competition coming up in Japan next month. I'm hoping to take home the top prize and continue to spread the joy of yo-yoing around the world.<p class=message>Well, I wish you the best of luck! It's been great talking to you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! It was my pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=63ff28ae-a8d4-4933-9f83-9a1c86500a2e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
