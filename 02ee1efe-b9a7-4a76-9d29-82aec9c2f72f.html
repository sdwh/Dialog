I hope everyone had a great weekend.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Professor! Yes, I had a great weekend, thanks for asking.<p class=message>Great to hear! So, let's dive right into today's topic which is about the importance of sleep.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. I think I need more sleep since I've been feeling tired lately.<p class=message>That's understandable. Did you know that getting enough sleep can improve your memory and creativity?<p class="message sent">Really? I had no idea. Maybe I should try sleeping early tonight.<p class=message>That's a good idea. But don't forget to also avoid caffeine and bright screens before bedtime.<p class="message sent">I will keep that in mind. By the way, have you seen the new movie that just came out?<p class=message>Which movie are you referring to?<p class="message sent">The one about the detective who can read minds.<p class=message>Oh, yes! It's a great movie. Have you watched it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It was really entertaining and mind-boggling.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Maybe we can talk about it next time or use it as an example in class.<p class="message sent">Sure, that would be great. Can't wait for our next class.<p class=message>Me too. Okay, class dismissed. Have a great day, everyone!<p class="message sent">Thank you, Professor. You too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=02ec6cb5-8c5b-45f6-8169-338ee8dde3a4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
