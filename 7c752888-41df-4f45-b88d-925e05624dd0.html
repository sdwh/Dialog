Do you usually have customers eating in your car?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Not often, but as long as you're not making a mess, I'm happy to let you enjoy your meal.<p class=message>I couldn't resist. I was on my way to a business meeting but when I saw this steakhouse, I knew I had to try it.<p class="message sent">Well, you made the right choice. This is one of my favorite steak places in town.<p class=message>What do you recommend for wine? I'm not much of a connoisseur.<p class="message sent">Let me see... How about a nice, full-bodied red like a Cabernet Sauvignon?<p class=message>That sounds perfect. Do you know anything interesting about this wine?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. Did you know that Cabernet Sauvignon grapes were originally from France, but they're now grown in many parts of the world, including California and Australia?<p class=message>Wow, I had no idea. You really know your stuff.<p class="message sent">(smiles) I like to learn about different things. It makes my job more interesting. Plus, I love seeing my passengers enjoying themselves.<p class=message>It's been a pleasure riding with you. Thanks for making this journey a lot more fun.<p class="message sent">Likewise. It's not every day that I get to share a meal with a passenger. Safe travels to you!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7c749f8a-d503-44c0-8eec-35ebe34d4b9d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
