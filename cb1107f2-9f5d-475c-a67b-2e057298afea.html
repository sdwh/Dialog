It’s tricky, but can be done with some planning and good infrastructure.<p class=message>What’s the most important factor in creating a highly available infrastructure?<p class="message sent">Redundancy. You need to have multiple servers, multiple power supplies, and multiple connections to the internet.<p class=message>That makes sense. Is there anything else we need to keep in mind?<p class="message sent">Definitely. We need to make sure we are using load balancers to distribute traffic evenly among servers, and also make sure we have disaster recovery plan in place.<p class=message>I see. Do we need to worry about latency?<p class="message sent">Yes, we definitely do. We need to make sure our servers are geographically distributed so we can minimize the time it takes to get data to our customers.<p class=message>This all sounds a bit overwhelming. Do you have any advice for keeping things organized?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We need a solid configuration management system in place, so that all changes are tracked, and we know exactly what’s happening in our infrastructure at all times.<p class=message>Great. One question though, what if a server goes down?<p class="message sent">We can’t let that happen. We should have monitoring systems in place, so we can detect if a server is not performing as expected and take action before it fails.<p class=message>Okay, that sounds good. This is all really helpful. Do you have any final tips?<p class="message sent">Just remember to keep things simple. We want a highly available infrastructure, but we don’t want to overcomplicate things.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cb0d32f1-52f8-40f7-ab1e-eb7989237ba5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
