Please have a seat. Can I offer you a drink or a snack?<p class="message sent">No, thanks. I'm good. So, what's the problem officer?<p class=message>We've received a report about a stolen car that matches the description of the one you were driving.<p class="message sent">Oh really? I didn't steal any car. I borrowed it from a friend.<p class=message>Can you give me the name and contact information of the owner of the car?<p class="message sent">Uh, I don't have it with me right now. I can give it to you later.<p class=message>Alright, that's fine. Now, can you tell me what you were doing around the time the car was reported stolen?<p class="message sent">I was at the pub, having a few drinks with my friends.<p class=message>Do you have any witnesses who can confirm your whereabouts?<p class="message sent">Actually, one of my friends was with me the whole time.<p class=message>Great, we'll need to talk to your friend too. Can you tell us his name and contact information?<p class="message sent">Sure, his name is John and I have his number in my phone.<p class=message>Okay, that's helpful. Now, can you explain why there was a broken window on the car when we found it?<p class="message sent">Oh, that. Well, John accidentally broke it when he was getting something from the car earlier.<p class=message>I see. Well, we'll need to verify your story with your friend and the owner of the car. Please don't leave town until we've completed our investigation.<p class="message sent">Alright, I understand.
