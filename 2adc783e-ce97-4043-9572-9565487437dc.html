How's it going?<p class="message sent">Pretty good, thanks for asking! How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, just checking in on our progress for the ISO 27001 audit plan.<p class="message sent">Ah yes, we should get started on that soon. Do you have any ideas for the scope of our audit?<p class=message>I was thinking we could focus on the data security measures put in place by the company, as well as their compliance with industry standards.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. I was also considering looking into their incident response procedures and training programs for employees.<p class=message>Definitely. And we should make sure to include a review of their documentation and record-keeping practices.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And maybe we could also evaluate their use of third-party vendors and their access to sensitive information.<p class=message>Perfect. We definitely have a solid plan in the works. And how about the timeline for the audit?<p class="message sent">Well, given the scope we've outlined, I think it would be best to plan for a two-week audit at the minimum.<p class=message>That sounds reasonable. And we should schedule it for the second quarter of the year, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that would allow us plenty of time to prepare and for the company to get their documentation in order.<p class=message>Alright, let's get started on drafting the audit plan then!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I'm looking forward to working with you on this project!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2adbf0ac-da92-482c-8108-46fd9b787147.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
