It's all about assessing the risks and impact of cyber-attacks on a business, right?<p class=message>That's right! And it's important because it helps companies be prepared for potential cyber threats.<p class="message sent">I remember reading something about it saying that it's like having a fire alarm installed - you hope you never have to use it but it's there just in case.<p class=message>That's a great analogy! It's better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to data breaches.<p class="message sent">Exactly! And it's not just for big companies. Even small businesses need to be aware of the risks and have an action plan in place.<p class=message>Yep, everyone's a target these days, even my grandmother's small flower shop!<p class="message sent">Ha! Your grandmother's flower shop must have some top-secret stuff!<p class=message>Oh definitely, the secret ingredient to her bouquets is highly classified information.<p class="message sent">Jokes aside, ISO 27001 Business Impact is all about protecting sensitive information and ensuring it's not compromised.<p class=message>Absolutely! It's like having a shield to protect your business from cybercriminals.<p class="message sent">And with the rise of cyber-attacks, it's becoming more important than ever to have these measures in place.<p class=message>You're right. It's better to be proactive and prepared than to be caught off guard.<p class="message sent">Agreed! And it's good to know that companies are taking cyber threats seriously.<p class=message>Yes, because at the end of the day, our data security should be a top priority.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e777e797-e0a4-4da9-8073-08aa3b43b9a2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
