I'm really excited that we're opening a new fast-food joint together.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's going to be great! Have you given any thought to what kind of food we should serve?<p class=message>Actually, I was thinking of having chicken burgers on the menu. They're always popular, and we could add our own unique twist to them.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. I can already picture it - juicy chicken patties, with some crispy lettuce and a special sauce.<p class=message>Yes! And we could also offer some sides with them, like sweet potato fries or onion rings.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds amazing. But we should also make sure that the chicken we use is high-quality and not too processed.<p class=message>Definitely. We want our customers to feel good about what they're eating. And we could even offer a vegetarian option for those who don't eat meat.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. We should always try to cater to everyone's tastes. And speaking of tastes, what do you think of having a spicy chicken burger on the menu too?<p class=message>Yes, that would be a great addition. Spicy food is so popular these days, and it would give our customers a new flavour to try.<p class="message sent">I'm so excited now! I can't wait to start experimenting with different recipes and coming up with the best chicken burger in town.<p class=message>Me too. I think this venture is going to be a real success. And who knows, maybe one day we'll have branches all over the world.<p class="message sent">Dream big, A! Dream big.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=82505638-a223-40a9-b8f9-fa8694c203ae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
