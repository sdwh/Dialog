But I think I've got everything under control now.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What kind of problem were you dealing with?<p class="message sent">The steering was all wonky and there were a few electrical issues as well, but I managed to fix everything up.<p class=message>Impressive, as always. Hey, have you tried some of Mrs. Johnson's homemade pies yet? They're delicious!<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But you know what I have tried? Some of the apples from these trees. They're amazing!<p class=message>Oh yeah, this farm has some great produce. Speaking of which, I think we need to check on the irrigation system today. Everything's been a bit dry lately.<p class="message sent">Good point. Do you want to start with the pump or should I check the sprinklers?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking I'd start in the main control room and then meet you out there, but if you want to start on the sprinklers I can come along.<p class="message sent">Nah, that's fine. I can handle it. You worry about the main system and I'll meet you back here in an hour or so.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. See you in a bit, B.<p class="message sent">See you, A. And don't forget to bring some water with you!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c417a2c1-28f2-4a66-9b25-54a24e26cbcf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
