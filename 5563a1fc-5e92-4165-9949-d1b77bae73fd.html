My name is A, and I'm a baker. It's my pleasure to meet you!<p class="message sent">Hello, A! My name is B, and I'm a tour guide. I'm excited to learn how to make some Spanish sweets today!<p class=message>Well, you've definitely come to the right place! I'm going to teach you how to make churros, a classic Spanish dessert.<p class="message sent">Fantastic! I've always wanted to try my hand at making churros. What's the first step?<p class=message>First, we need to mix together some flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Then, we'll add some hot water and stir it all together.<p class="message sent">That sounds easy enough! What comes next?<p class=message>Next, we'll pipe the mixture into long, thin strips using a pastry bag. Then, we'll fry them in hot oil until they're golden brown.<p class="message sent">Yum! I can't wait to try them. What's next on the menu?<p class=message>We'll also be making flan, which is a custard dessert with caramel topping. We'll cook the custard in a water bath to make it silky smooth.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious, too. You sure know how to make my mouth water!<p class=message>Well, that's my job! One thing to keep in mind when making flan is to be patient and let it chill in the fridge overnight before serving.<p class="message sent">Good tip! I can't wait to impress my friends with my new Spanish dessert-making skills. Thank you so much for teaching me!<p class=message>It was my pleasure! I'm always happy to share my baking knowledge with others. Don't forget to try some churros with a side of hot chocolate for the ultimate Spanish treat!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=55627965-bfa7-494b-a331-fbe4f8ac6e6f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
