How long have you been driving taxis in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Good morning, sir. I’ve been driving for more than 10 years now. It's a great job, meeting new people every day.<p class=message>Oh, I see. Do you enjoy driving even in traffic jams?<p class="message sent">Actually, it's not the best part of driving. But you learn how to cope with it, and with a great playlist, it can be enjoyable.<p class=message>That sounds like a good suggestion. So, what’s the most interesting place that you have taken someone to?<p class="message sent">Hmm...probably to the top of Skytree in Sumida. It's breathtaking to see Tokyo from above.<p class=message>That must be amazing! Have you ever been there yourself?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. I took my family there for my daughter's birthday. We had a great view and a delicious meal.<p class=message>Nice! Are there any other places you would recommend visiting in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Definitely the Imperial Palace and, of course, Shibuya Crossing. It’s something to see, with all the people and bright lights.<p class=message>Yes, I heard about those places before. What hobbies do you have besides driving?<p class="message sent">Well, I like to play golf with friends. It’s a great way to relax and socialize.<p class=message>Golf sounds exciting! I've always wanted to try it. Do you have any tips for beginners?<p class="message sent">Patience and practice is key. It can be frustrating, but don’t give up. And most importantly, have fun!<p class=message>Thanks for the great tip. We've arrived at our destination. Here’s your fare, and keep the change as a tip.<p class="message sent">Thank you, sir. Have a great day, and enjoy your time here in Tokyo.<p class=message>Thank you, and same to you.
