So, how long have you been a taxi driver in Los Angeles?<p class="message sent">Hi! I’ve been driving for about 10 years now. LA is a fun city to drive in!<p class=message>I’m excited for this trip. I’ve never been to Los Angeles before. Have you ever been to any tourist attractions around here?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I’ve been to a couple of places. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is pretty cool, and so is the Griffith Observatory. Have you planned out your itinerary?<p class=message>Not really - just planning to explore the city! But definitely want to hit up some good restaurants for some tacos and burgers.<p class="message sent">Oh, for sure! LA has some amazing food spots. Have you ever tried “In-N-Out” burger?<p class=message>No, I haven’t. Is it really that good?<p class="message sent">Yes, it’s a must-try! Let me know if you need more recommendations.<p class=message>Thanks! Hey is it true that LA traffic is always really bad?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, it can definitely get pretty congested. But that’s the best time to people-watch, and you might even see a few celebrities driving around.<p class=message>(laughs) That would be awesome! But honestly, I’m just excited to be here and experience everything.<p class="message sent">That’s the right attitude to have! LA has so much to offer. (pauses for a moment) Oh no, looks like we’re stuck in some traffic already.<p class=message>(sighs) Well, I’m in no rush. Maybe we can play some music to pass the time?<p class="message sent">Good idea. Let me see what I have queued up. (turns on some music) How about some classic rock?<p class=message>Perfect! Nothing like some good tunes to make the traffic less frustrating. (both laugh)<p class="message sent">It’s moments like these that make the job worth it. Meeting new people and having fun conversations.<p class=message>Absolutely. Thanks for being a great taxi driver and making this ride enjoyable.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Happy to help! And welcome to Los Angeles.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c387d0d2-a117-4fa4-b9b3-73685f069812.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
