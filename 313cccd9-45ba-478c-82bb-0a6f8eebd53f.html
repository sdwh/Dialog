How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm pretty good, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks for asking. So, what brings you here today?<p class="message sent">Well, I was hoping we could talk about the client's recent influx of requests.<p class=message>Ah, I see. It's been a bit overwhelming, hasn't it?<p class="message sent">Definitely. But I think we can come up with a solution.<p class=message>Alright, what do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">I was thinking we could implement a load balancer to distribute the requests evenly among different servers.<p class=message>That's a great idea! And we could also consider adding more servers to handle the traffic.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's another good option. But we need to make sure we have enough resources for that.<p class=message>Good point. We should also look into optimizing the code to reduce processing time.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And we could also consider caching frequently accessed data to speed things up.<p class=message>Oh, that's a good idea. Do you have any recommendations for a caching system?<p class="message sent">Yes, I think Redis would be a good choice. It's fast, reliable, and easy to use.<p class=message>Excellent! I'll get started on researching and implementing all these solutions.<p class="message sent">Great! Let's touch base again in a few days to see how things are going.<p class=message>Sounds good to me! Thanks for your help, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. See you later!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=31375751-db74-4faa-931f-0f4dd1ed768a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
