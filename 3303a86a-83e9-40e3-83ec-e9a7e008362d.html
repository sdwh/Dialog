What can I get you?<p class=message>I was thinking of trying something new. What's your recommendation today?<p class="message sent">We have a new Ethiopian blend that pairs really well with our cinnamon rolls. Would you like to try that?<p class=message>Sounds great. And do you have any new pastry to go along with that?<p class="message sent">Yes, we just made a batch of apple crumble tarts. The cinnamon in the coffee complements the sweetness of the apples really nicely.<p class=message>Okay, I'll take a cup of the Ethiopian blend and one apple crumble tart, please.<p class="message sent">Coming right up. By the way, I'm really impressed with your recent batch of éclairs. What's your secret?<p class=message>Ah, it's all in the pastry cream. I added a touch of lemon zest for some tanginess.<p class="message sent">That's genius. I'll have to try that next time. And have you ever experimented with fruit-flavored creams?<p class=message>All the time! I love using seasonal fruits like strawberries or raspberries. They make for a really refreshing taste.<p class="message sent">Wow, I'll have to try that too. By the way, have you seen that new coffee machine they just released?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's special about it?<p class="message sent">It has an adjustable grind size and temperature control. You can really customize your brew to your liking.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. We should definitely consider getting one for the café.<p class="message sent">Definitely! It would let us showcase all our unique coffee flavors to the max.<p class=message>Speaking of which, I've been craving a hazelnut latte lately. Can you make that for me?<p class="message sent">Of course, give me a second. One hazelnut latte coming right up.<p class=message>You're the best! I really love working with someone who's passionate about their craft.<p class="message sent">Aww, thank you. Same to you. It really shows in the quality of your pastries.<p class=message>Well, that's what we're here for, right? To make people happy with our delicious treats.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And with great coffee to go with them, we're unbeatable.<p class=message>Agreed! Let's continue making people's afternoons brighter, one cup of coffee and pastry at a time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=32ff55c5-8d47-4312-b5cb-b55d847ddaf4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
