I'm the new barista. You must be the restaurant owner.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's me. Welcome to our team! Your cappuccinos are going to be a hit, I'm sure.<p class=message>Thank you, glad to hear that. Say, have you thought about serving some pastries alongside our coffee menu?<p class="message sent">Actually, I haven't. But that sounds like a great idea! What kind of pastries do you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, how about croissants, muffins, and scones? And we can switch up the flavors every now and then.<p class="message sent">Brilliant! What about gluten-free and vegan options?<p class=message>Definitely. I can make some gluten-free muffins and we can have a vegan-friendly pastry of the day.<p class="message sent">This is exactly the kind of creativity I was hoping for. I'm so excited to see what other ideas you have!<p class=message>Thank you! I'm also thinking of adding some latte art to our drinks. Have you seen those cute foamy designs?<p class="message sent">I have, and they look amazing. Let's definitely make that a part of our coffee experience.<p class=message>Sounds good. And we can also have some monthly deals, like a free pastry with a large coffee, or a discount on a latte with a croissant.<p class="message sent">Perfect. We want to give our customers a reason to come back, and I think these ideas will do just that.<p class=message>Absolutely. With great coffee and tasty pastries, our caf√© will be the talk of the town in no time.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Let's get to work and make it happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=30d2f4a6-ecd9-4843-9c2c-77f1425d1c0e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
