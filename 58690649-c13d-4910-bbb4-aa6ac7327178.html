I've never really been a pool person, but I love hotels with fancy gyms.<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm with you on that one! I have to get my workout in even when I'm on vacation.<p class=message>Do you like hotels with spas? I feel like it's the ultimate way to relax.<p class="message sent">Oh my gosh, yes. I always book a massage or facial when I'm staying in a hotel with a spa. It's so indulgent.<p class=message>What about hotel restaurants? Do you like to eat at them or explore the local food scene?<p class="message sent">It really depends on the hotel's reputation. If the restaurant has great reviews, I'll definitely check it out. But if the food scene in the town or city is known for something specific, then I want to try that too.<p class=message>That makes sense. Have you ever stayed in a hotel with a rooftop bar?<p class="message sent">Yes! I absolutely love them. The view is usually amazing, and it's such a unique experience.<p class=message>I completely agree. I also love hotels with big comfortable beds. It's the best feeling after a long day of exploring.<p class="message sent">Yes, and I always appreciate when the pillows are nice and fluffy too.<p class=message>That's definitely a must-have for hotels. Have you ever tried room service?<p class="message sent">Of course! It's such a treat to have breakfast in bed or a late night snack delivered straight to your room.<p class=message>I'm all about that too. Have you ever stayed in a hotel with a mini bar?<p class="message sent">Yes, but honestly, I rarely use them. It's just too expensive most of the time.<p class=message>I hear you on that one. Speaking of budget, have you ever stayed in a hostel?<p class="message sent">I have! It's a super budget-friendly option, but you definitely sacrifice some privacy for the affordability.<p class=message>That's true. Well, it sounds like we have a lot in common when it comes to hotel preferences. Maybe we should plan a trip together sometime!<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea!
