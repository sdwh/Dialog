I am loving the new live debugging feature. It makes troubleshooting so much easier.<p class=message>Yes, and have you tried the integrated Git support? Commits and merges have never been more straightforward.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. But wait, did you know that you can customize the themes in Visual Studio?<p class=message>No way! I need to try that out. Maybe I can finally create a more vibrant workspace for myself.<p class="message sent">Exactly! The variety of personalization options is excellent. Speaking of which, have you personalized your keyboard shortcuts yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I definitely should. It would save me so much time in the long run.<p class="message sent">For sure. And do not forget to check out the Code Cleanup tool. It tidies up any inconsistent indentations and spacing issues and makes code a hundred times neater.<p class=message>Wow, I'll definitely look into that. But have you used any extensions lately?<p class="message sent">I have! I just installed an extension that adds new code snippets to the toolbox. It has saved me so much time!<p class=message>That's awesome. I should probably expand my knowledge on extensions.<p class="message sent">You definitely should. There are plenty of extensions with different functions, and you can even create your own.<p class=message>Sounds like something I could get into. Are there any tips you can give me for when I try to create my own extension?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Just remember that simplicity and functionality are key. You do not want to create an extension that is too complex to use.<p class=message>Understood. Thanks for the advice. You are always so helpful.<p class="message sent">No problem! We are all here to help each other grow as developers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5762b2ff-17b7-41a8-83e6-9f34dc235bad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
