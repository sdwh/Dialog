Are you going to pair that with breakfast?<p class=message>Yes, I was thinking of having the breakfast pasta. How is that made?<p class="message sent">It's a classic pasta dish with bacon, egg, and parmesan cheese. Our chef makes it fresh every morning.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! Do you have any recommendations for a drink to go with it?<p class="message sent">Since you ordered a shot of espresso, I would recommend an Americano to balance out the bitterness. But, if you prefer something sweet, a latte would be a great choice.<p class=message>Alright, I'll take your recommendation and order an Americano. How long have you been working here?<p class="message sent">I've been here for two years now. How about you, have you always been a baker?<p class=message>Yes, I've been a bread maker for five years now. It's a satisfying job, seeing people enjoy what I create.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. What's your favorite kind of bread to make?<p class=message>I love making sourdough bread. The process is challenging, but the outcome is worth it.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. Do you also make pastries?<p class=message>Yes, I do. I specialize in croissants and danishes.<p class="message sent">Wow, I'm definitely going to try them sometime. Here's your Americano and breakfast pasta. Enjoy!<p class=message>Thank you, it looks amazing. And let me know if you want to try one of my pastries. I'll give you a discount.<p class="message sent">That's so generous of you. I'll definitely take you up on that offer. Have a great day!<p class=message>You too, thanks for the great service!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ee35a17b-5f60-4a30-80a6-9ec77fa687d8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
