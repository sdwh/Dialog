How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">I'm feeling a bit better, Doctor A. Thanks for asking.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Let me take a look at your chart. It seems like we'll need to perform a few tests today.<p class="message sent">Oh boy, here we go again. Will it hurt?<p class=message>I promise to make it as painless as possible. Have you been following the medication schedule I gave you?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. Though, it's not easy waking up early to take them.<p class=message>I understand. It's important to keep a routine, especially for your health. By the way, have you tried watching any movies or reading books to pass the time?<p class="message sent">Actually yes, I've watched a couple of good movies on Netflix. Got any recommendations?<p class=message>Great to hear that. You should try watching "The Queen's Gambit". It's a chess-themed mini-series, and I think you'll enjoy it.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting, I'll definitely give it a try. Do you also play chess, Doctor A?<p class=message>Yes, I do. In fact, I play chess with some of the nurses during our breaks. It's a great way to exercise our minds.<p class="message sent">Wow, I never knew that. I thought doctors were always busy.<p class=message>We are, but we also make time for things we enjoy. That's how we stay positive and motivated, even during tough times. Speaking of which, I think we're done with the tests. You can take a rest now, and we'll get back to you with the results soon.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Doctor A. You're a great doctor and a good friend too.<p class=message>Likewise, B. Just remember to keep fighting, and we'll beat this thing together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=976c4c51-8248-428b-8f5f-7ea37032e2e4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
