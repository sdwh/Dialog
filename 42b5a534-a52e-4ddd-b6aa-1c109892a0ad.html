How's the patrol going so far?"<p class="message sent">"It's been pretty quiet, thank goodness. No major incidents to report. You?"<p class=message>"Same here. But you never know, things can change in an instant."<p class="message sent">"Ain't that the truth. Hey, did you hear about the cat burglary at the jewelry store last night?"<p class=message>"Yeah, I did. What a strange case. The thief only stole a necklace, but he left a trail of catnip behind."<p class="message sent">"Haha, yeah I heard about that. Maybe we should start carrying some catnip with us, just in case we need to lure any suspects out of hiding."<p class=message>"Now that's a new tactic for me. But hey, we have to be creative, right?"<p class="message sent">"Absolutely. So, did you catch the game last night?"<p class=message>"I sure did. What an epic matchup. I can't believe our team pulled off the win in the last second!"<p class="message sent">"Right? That was insane. I was on the edge of my seat the whole game."<p class=message>"Me too. That's what makes sports so exciting. You never know what's going to happen."<p class="message sent">"Speaking of which, I heard there's going to be a charity basketball game next weekend. Are you interested in playing?"<p class=message>"Definitely. Count me in. It'll be great to have some fun while supporting a good cause."<p class="message sent">"Agreed. And who knows, maybe we'll discover some hidden basketball talent in our department."<p class=message>"Haha, stranger things have happened. But let's keep our day jobs just in case."<p class="message sent">"Absolutely. Alright, let's keep moving. We've got a beat to cover."</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=42b59736-5257-4405-810f-fe9e2792fe24.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
