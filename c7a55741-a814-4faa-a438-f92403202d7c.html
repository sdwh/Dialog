Do you know what that sign means?<p class=message>Yes, officer. It means I have to stop my car completely, right?<p class="message sent">That's right, sir. It's for the safety of everyone on the road. Can you tell me why you didn't stop?<p class=message>Oh, I'm sorry officer. I missed that sign. I was looking at my GPS.<p class="message sent">Please remember to keep your eyes on the road and follow the signs. That includes the STOP sign ahead.<p class=message>I will, officer. Thank you for reminding me.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, sir. Have you noticed any other road signs along the way?<p class=message>Yes, I did. There was a sign for a roundabout a few blocks ago. Also, there's a pedestrian crossing sign up ahead.<p class="message sent">Very good sir. Always keep an eye out for road signs, especially STOP signs. Follow the rules of the road for everyone's safety.<p class=message>I completely agree, officer. Safety should be everyone's top priority on the road.<p class="message sent">That's right, sir. Now, please make sure you come to a complete stop at the next STOP sign.<p class=message>Will do, officer. Thanks for your help.<p class="message sent">No problem, sir. Drive safely and have a good day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c7a4a8d9-6ddc-42cb-9cdf-266a47793330.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
