How are you feeling today, B?<p class="message sent">Hello, Dr. A. I'm feeling quite nervous, to be honest.<p class=message>Nothing to be worried about. Let's take a look at your chart.<p class="message sent">Okay, sounds good.<p class=message>It looks like you came in with some symptoms of the flu. Have you been experiencing a fever or coughing?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've had both. It's been pretty tough to shake.<p class=message>Don't worry, we'll run some tests to see what medication will work best for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I appreciate it.<p class=message>While you're here, I also noticed that you're due for a routine check-up. How have you been feeling otherwise?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I've been pretty stressed out lately. Work has been really busy.<p class=message>Ah, I understand. It's important to take care of your mental health too. Have you tried any relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't really thought about it.<p class=message>Well, maybe it's worth a try. And in the meantime, let's get you started on some medication to help with the flu symptoms.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, thanks again.<p class=message>Of course, we're here to help. Is there anything else you wanted to discuss?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have a bit of a rash on my arm. Do you think it's anything serious?<p class=message>Let me take a look at that. It doesn't seem too concerning, but we'll run some tests just in case.<p class="message sent">Okay, thanks for checking.<p class=message>No problem. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you.<p class="message sent">Got it. Thanks again for all your help!<p class=message>Anytime, B. Take care and get some rest.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b9d22f61-65ae-40ba-b060-666c135df2f3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
