I'm feeling adventurous today so I need your help picking out a tasty main course.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, we have some great options to choose from. Are you in the mood for something hearty or light?<p class=message>Hmm, how about something in-between? Maybe a grilled chicken dish?<p class="message sent">That's a fantastic choice! Our grilled chicken breast is juicy and full of flavor. Would you like it with some sides or fries?<p class=message>Definitely some sides, maybe some roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a well-rounded dish. May I also recommend a glass of our house red wine to complement it?<p class=message>Oh yes, please do! I'm not too knowledgeable on wines, what do you suggest?<p class="message sent">Our house red is a merlot with a smooth finish that pairs well with chicken dishes. Would you like to try a glass?<p class=message>I'll take your word for it and give it a shot. Thank you for your recommendations!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, happy to assist. Can I get you anything else, or are you ready to order?<p class=message>I think that's all for now, let's go ahead and order the grilled chicken dish with the sides and a glass of the house red.<p class="message sent">Perfect! That will be out shortly. Is there anything else I can assist you with in the meantime?<p class=message>No, we're good. Thank you again for your help, I appreciate it.<p class="message sent">Anytime! Enjoy your meal.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c3cf2b9c-ab67-48b7-98ab-122c137d642c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
