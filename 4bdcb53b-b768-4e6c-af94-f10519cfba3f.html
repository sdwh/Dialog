I'm really excited to see your opera performance tonight. What is the theme of the show?<p class="message sent">Hello there! Thank you for coming. The theme of the opera is love and betrayal.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting! Will there be a happy ending?<p class="message sent">I can't tell you that, you'll have to wait and see.<p class=message>Alright, I'm excited for the suspense then. How long have you been performing opera?<p class="message sent">I've been performing for over 10 years now. It's a passion of mine.<p class=message>That's amazing. Do you remember your very first performance?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. I was a nervous wreck, but it was a great learning experience for me.<p class=message>I can only imagine. What do you do to prepare for a big show like this?<p class="message sent">Well, I do my vocal warmups and practice my lines and songs for hours on end. I also make sure I'm well-rested and hydrated.<p class=message>It sounds like you take your craft very seriously. Are there any funny moments you've experienced during a performance?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely! There was one time where a prop fell over and hit me in the head. I had to continue singing with a big bump on my head.<p class=message>Oh no! That must have been hard to continue without breaking character.<p class="message sent">It was definitely a challenge, but the show must go on!<p class=message>Well, I'm excited to see you perform tonight. Break a leg!<p class="message sent">Thank you, I appreciate it! Enjoy the show.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4bdb8c67-54e2-4547-a7a3-8fdabf7a08f9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
