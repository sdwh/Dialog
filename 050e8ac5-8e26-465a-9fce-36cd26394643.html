Can I get you something to drink while you look at the menu?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll take a glass of champagne to start.<p class=message>Excellent choice! We have a great selection. And how about an appetizer to whet your appetite?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me see. How about the foie gras terrine?<p class=message>The foie gras is a specialty of ours. It comes with a homemade brioche and fig jam. Would you like me to suggest a wine to pair with that?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. I'm not really a wine expert, so any recommendation would be appreciated.<p class=message>I'd suggest a Sauternes. Its sweetness will complement the richness of the foie gras well. Would you like to try it?<p class="message sent">Sounds great. Go ahead and bring a bottle of that.<p class=message>Coming right up! By the way, have you ever tried our signature dish, the Aussie wagyu steak?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it good?<p class=message>It's one of our best-sellers. It's juicy, tender, and perfectly cooked. And since you're a foodie, I know that you'll appreciate the marbling and quality of this beef.<p class="message sent">You're right, I love discovering new food experiences. I'm sold! Let's go for the Aussie wagyu steak.<p class=message>Great choice! And for sides, we have truffle mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables. Would you like to add any of those?<p class="message sent">Yes, let's get both. This meal sounds amazing already.<p class=message>I'm glad you're enjoying it. And for dessert, we have a lava cake with a molten center and vanilla bean ice cream.<p class="message sent">Yum! I can't resist chocolate. That sounds perfect.<p class=message>It's a customer favorite. We make it fresh to order, so you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!<p class="message sent">Thank you, everything sounds wonderful. I'm excited to try them all!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=050821d6-4546-473c-8e30-ff017e529690.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
