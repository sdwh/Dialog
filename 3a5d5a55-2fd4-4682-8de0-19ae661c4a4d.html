Are you ready for your trip to Perth?<p class=message>Yes, I am very excited. It's going to be my first time visiting Australia.<p class="message sent">You're in for a treat. Perth has some of the most beautiful beaches and landscapes in the world.<p class=message>That's what I heard. Have you been to Perth before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. I actually used to live there for a few years.<p class=message>Oh, so you know all the good spots then?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I can recommend some great places to eat and visit.<p class=message>That would be awesome. Do you have any favorite restaurants?<p class="message sent">Yes, there's this great seafood place by the beach that I always go to. The fish and chips are amazing.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. I can't wait to try it.<p class="message sent">It's a good thing you're not here during the winter though. You'll avoid the cold weather!<p class=message>I've heard it doesn't get too cold in Perth.<p class="message sent">No, not nearly as cold as some other places in Australia. But it can still get chilly at night.<p class=message>Thanks for the heads up. By the way, do you have any recommendations for activities to do during the day?<p class="message sent">Definitely visit Kings Park for some stunning views of the city. And if you're feeling adventurous, take a trip to Rottnest Island to see some cute quokkas.<p class=message>Quokkas? I've never heard of those.<p class="message sent">They're small animals that are only found in Western Australia. They're very friendly and love taking selfies!<p class=message>Wow, I'll definitely have to check that out. Thanks for all the tips.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Enjoy your trip to Perth and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3a5aa86d-6800-4c4b-8151-7b88e54955b2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
