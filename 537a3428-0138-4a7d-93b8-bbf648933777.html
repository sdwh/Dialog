I saw that you brought an envelope with you today. Do you know the different parts of an envelope?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Yes, I do. The sender refers to the person who is sending the letter.<p class=message>That's correct! And the return address is the sender's address. How about the mailing address?<p class="message sent">The mailing address is the address of the person who is receiving the letter.<p class=message>Right! And do you know what the postmark is?<p class="message sent">The postmark is the stamp on the envelope that shows the date and location of where the letter was mailed.<p class=message>Excellent! And who is the recipient?<p class="message sent">The recipient is the person who is receiving the letter.<p class=message>Very good! And can you tell me what a zip code is?<p class="message sent">A zip code is a series of numbers that identifies a particular geographic location in the United States.<p class=message>You're absolutely right! Knowing all these parts of an envelope is important when mailing letters or any type of correspondence. Have you ever mailed a letter before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't, A. Can you teach me how to properly address an envelope?<p class=message>Of course, B! Let me show you. First, write the sender's information in the top left corner. Then, in the center, write the recipient's information.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it!<p class=message>Next, make sure to include the zip code, so the letter arrives at its destination faster. Then, put a stamp on the top right corner.<p class="message sent">This is so interesting, A! I feel like I know a lot more about sending letters now.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that, B. It's always helpful to know the basics of sending mail. Who knows, you might have to mail something important one day!<p class="message sent">Thank you, A! I really appreciate your help.<p class=message>You're welcome, B. Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any more questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=537830f0-d297-47ac-b36c-d6d9b45e257e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
