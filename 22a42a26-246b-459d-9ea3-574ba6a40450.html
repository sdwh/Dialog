How are you doing B?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing well. Just came back from my vacation. Thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing good too. So, are you ready for the review of your annual reports?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I hope everything is in order.<p class=message>Your report looks great. I just have a few queries. Can you provide me with a little more detail about your company's expenses?<p class="message sent">Yeah sure. I think we should start with our team-building activities. They're a little expensive, but they're worth it.<p class=message>As your client, I truly believe that team-building activities are a crucial investment for any company. Especially when they lead to more productivity and better team coordination.<p class="message sent">Exactly! They not only help us foster a positive work environment, but also generate better collaborations within teams.<p class=message>Speaking of positive work environments, have you thought about organizing a company picnic for your employees?<p class="message sent">That's actually a great idea! Let's discuss that in more detail later.<p class=message>Sure! We can even discuss ways to minimize the expenses.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A.
