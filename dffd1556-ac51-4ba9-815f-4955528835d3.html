How's it going?"<p class="message sent">"Hey A, all good here. Just trying to keep up with the score updates. How about you?"<p class=message>"Same here, it seems like we're getting plenty of action in this game. You're doing a great job keeping the scoreboard updated though!"<p class="message sent">"Thanks, I've got this down after doing it for a few seasons now. Although, guests keep asking some confusing questions about innings."<p class=message>"Yeah, tell me about it. I once had someone question why there were 9 innings instead of 10, thinking it had to do with the number of players on the field."<p class="message sent">"Haha, that's a good one. But speaking of the field, did you see that home run from the home team earlier?"<p class=message>"Oh yeah, it was killer! Speaking of which, have you updated the home score yet?"<p class="message sent">"Yep, just did it. And it looks like we've got a good game going with only a few balls and strikes so far."<p class=message>"Fingers crossed it doesn't end in a tie with all these outs happening."<p class="message sent">"Definitely. But hey, at least we're out here enjoying the sunshine and fresh air instead of being cooped up in the office."<p class=message>"For sure, and it's always a good time working with you on these games. Looking forward to the next one already."<p class="message sent">"Likewise, A. We make a great team!"</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dff7e7bd-794b-416b-9946-d3009991e886.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
