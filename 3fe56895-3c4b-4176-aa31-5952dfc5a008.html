How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I have a reservation for a single room under the name of Smith.<p class=message>Let me check that for you. Yes, I see your reservation right here, Mr. Smith. May I please have your ID and credit card for verification?<p class="message sent">Sure, here you go.<p class=message>Thank you. Just a moment, please. (types in information) Perfect, everything seems to be in order. Your room is on the 7th floor, and our elevators are located to your right.<p class="message sent">Thank you very much. Can you recommend any good restaurants or bars in the area?<p class=message>Of course! There are many options in the vicinity, but my personal favorite is Joe's Stone Crab. It's a local landmark and offers some of the best seafood in town.<p class="message sent">Sounds great, I'll definitely check it out. Also, do you have any advice on where to go for entertainment?<p class=message>You can't go wrong with the nightlife on Ocean Drive. It's just a few blocks away and has a great atmosphere. If you want a quieter option, I recommend the Bass Museum of Art, which is nearby as well.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the suggestions. Oh, and do you provide beach towels?<p class=message>Yes, we do. You can pick them up at the front desk on the way to the beach. Enjoy your stay!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3fdde4d2-df1b-4cc3-b98e-6623c364c62f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
