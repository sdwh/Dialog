I can't believe how many books they have here in Tokyo.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's definitely a great place to find some inspiration for your writing. What kind of book are you interested in?<p class=message>Well, I'm always looking for something new and different. Maybe a Japanese author or a book about Japanese culture.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. Japanese literature is so rich and diverse. Have you read any Haruki Murakami?<p class=message>Yeah, I'm a big fan of Murakami. But I'm looking for something a bit more obscure, something that I wouldn't find at home.<p class="message sent">Have you heard of Yoko Tawada or Banana Yoshimoto? They're both very unique and have a distinct style.<p class=message>No, I haven't heard of them before. Thank you for the recommendations. I'll definitely check them out.<p class="message sent">Of course, and it's not just the authors. Reading books in the original language and exploring the nuances of Japanese language and culture can be a great source of inspiration.<p class=message>That's a great point. I might even try learning some Japanese while I'm here.<p class="message sent">That would be a great idea! And who knows, maybe one day you'll write a novel that gets translated into Japanese!<p class=message>Haha, now that would be a dream come true. But for now, I think I'll just enjoy exploring this amazing bookstore and all the wonderful books it has to offer. Thanks for coming with me, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. It's always great to explore new places and discover new literature together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f5c9fb6b-478d-47a8-858d-5bb72d913461.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
