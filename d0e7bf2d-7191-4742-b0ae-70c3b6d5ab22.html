Glad you could make it out to the farm today.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, Farmer A. So, what kind of animals do you have here on your pasture?<p class=message>We have a mix of cows, pigs, and sheep here on the farm. They've been feeling a bit under the weather lately, so we called you in to help us out.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Well, let's get started with the check-up then. How about we start with the cows?<p class=message>Sure thing. They're over in that paddock there. I'll bring them over to you.<p class="message sent">Great. Now, let's see... Hmm, they look healthy for the most part, but it seems like they might have a bit of indigestion. Have you been feeding them anything different lately?<p class=message>Actually, we've been giving them some new grain that we ordered in. Maybe that might be the cause of it?<p class="message sent">That could be it. I recommend cutting back on the amount of new grain you're giving them and see how they react. As for the other animals, let's take a look at them one by one.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let's start with the pigs next.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's see... Oh, these pigs are looking great! Good weight, no signs of illness, and their coats are shining.<p class=message>Really? That's great to hear! Maybe we're doing something right after all.<p class="message sent">You certainly are. Keep up the good work. Lastly, we'll take a look at the sheep.<p class=message>Okay, let me bring them over to you. Here they are.<p class="message sent">Hmm, it looks like some of them might have a bit of a cold. Have you noticed any coughing or sneezing among the herd?<p class=message>Now that you mention it, I have heard some of them coughing. What's the treatment for that?<p class="message sent">It's nothing too serious; just a little common cold. I'll prescribe some medication for them that should clear it up in no time.<p class=message>Thank you so much for your help, Dr. B. We really appreciate it.<p class="message sent">Of course, Farmer A. It's my pleasure to help out the community. If you have any other concerns in the future, don't hesitate to give me a ring.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d0e32325-5fae-4b9d-b71c-a398854a8669.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
