How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hey A! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. Busy day ahead of us today, huh?<p class=message>Yes indeed. We have a lot of orders for our famous sourdough bread and chocolate croissants.<p class="message sent">Oh man, those are my favorites! You really know how to make them perfect.<p class=message>Thanks, B. It's all about the attention to detail and using the best quality ingredients.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Hey, have you tried that new chocolate chip cookie recipe?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's amazing. I bet it will be a hit with our customers.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Anything new in the works for upcoming holiday seasons?<p class=message>Actually, I was thinking about experimenting with some pumpkin spice flavored bread and muffins. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing! I'm sure they will sell like hotcakes.<p class=message>Haha, I see what you did there! Speaking of hotcakes, we need to make sure we have enough batter for our pancakes.<p class="message sent">Right, and don't forget about the biscuits and gravy - they're always a customer favorite.<p class=message>Definitely. Hey, did you see that article about the benefits of a plant-based diet? We could incorporate some vegan options in our menu.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We should start brainstorming some possibilities. Our vegan customers will definitely appreciate it.<p class=message>Absolutely. Alright, time to get to work. We have some delicious treats to bake!<p class="message sent">Indeed we do. Let's get started and make sure everything's perfect before the customers come in.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b944a5c6-b723-4ea2-906a-a7e1894f7b2e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
