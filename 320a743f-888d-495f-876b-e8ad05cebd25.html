I'm A, leading the ISO 27001 audit. Nice to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Hi, A. Nice to meet you too. I'm a network engineer.<p class=message>Great. Let's get started. Can you show me your network setup?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Follow me. *leads A to server room*<p class=message>Whoa, this is pretty impressive. Is this where you hide your secrets?<p class="message sent">*laughs* Yes, this is our treasure room. But no secrets here, just lots of cables and servers.<p class=message>Alright, let's focus. Hmm...these servers seem a bit outdated. When was the last time you upgraded them?<p class="message sent">Eh, we've had some budget constraints recently, so not for a while.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Well, we'll have to make a note of that. But let's talk about security measures.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. We have firewalls, regular backups, constant monitoring...<p class=message>Wow, you guys are really on top of things. But have you considered implementing two-factor authentication?<p class="message sent">Actually, we just started looking into that! Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Definitely. There are some great software solutions out there, and I can provide you with some resources.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Thanks, A. This is actually turning out to be a pretty painless audit.<p class=message>*laughs* Glad to hear it. But don't get too comfortable, we're not done yet.<p class="message sent">Oh, I know. But hey, maybe we can grab a drink after this is over.<p class=message>*smiling* Sounds good to me, B. Let's finish this audit strong.<p class="message sent">You got it, A. Thanks for making this a bit more lighthearted.<p class=message>Of course, B. Life's too short to be serious all the time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=320928ab-059a-4a61-913e-3345843f704e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
