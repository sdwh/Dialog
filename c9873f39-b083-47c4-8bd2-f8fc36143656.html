I'm the lead auditor for ISO 27001. I'll be conducting the audit today.<p class="message sent">Hi, nice to meet you too. I'm the network engineer responsible for implementing the security measures. Welcome to our office.<p class=message>Thanks. So, let's start by reviewing the risk assessment process. How do you identify and evaluate risks in your network?<p class="message sent">Well, we begin by identifying the assets we want to protect and the potential threats. Then we assess the likelihood of each threat occurring and the potential impact.<p class=message>Sounds good. Have you faced any security breaches in the past?<p class="message sent">Thankfully, no major breaches. However, we did have a minor incident where an employee accidentally clicked on a phishing email.<p class=message>Ah, that's a common issue. Have you taken any steps to prevent such incidents in the future?<p class="message sent">Yes, we've conducted awareness training for all employees and deployed an advanced email filtering system.<p class=message>Excellent. Moving on, how do you ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information?<p class="message sent">We use encryption to protect data both in transit and at rest. We also have strict access controls and monitoring mechanisms.<p class=message>Great to hear. Now, let's talk about physical security. How do you protect your data centers and servers?<p class="message sent">We have installed biometric access controls, CCTV cameras, and fire suppression systems. Our servers are also located in secure, offsite locations.<p class=message>Impressive measures. Finally, do you have a disaster recovery plan in place?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We have regular backups, redundant systems, and a tested recovery plan to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster.<p class=message>That's good to know. Well, that concludes the audit. I must say, I'm very impressed with the security measures you have in place.<p class="message sent">Thank you, we take our security very seriously. It was great working with you, and we appreciate your thorough audit.<p class=message>My pleasure. Keep up the good work, and I'll see you again next year for the audit review.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Have a great day!<p class=message>You too! Thank you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c980e73d-b84f-42a3-b78d-5e5cf1a56373.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
