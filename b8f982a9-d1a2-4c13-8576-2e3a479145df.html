People love to learn about different cultures when they travel.<p class=message>That's true. We should also consider having a section that offers recommendations for nearby restaurants and food spots.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And to take it up a notch, we could incorporate a feature that provides users with popular dishes and drinks from the area they're in.<p class=message>Wow, that's a great idea. What about a section for local events and festivals?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We could even integrate ticket purchasing for those events in the app.<p class=message>This is shaping up to be quite the app. How about a feature that helps users plan their itinerary for the trip?<p class="message sent">Yes, we could have a day-by-day planner with a map feature that helps people navigate around the city.<p class=message>And we could add in a "My Favourites" section, so that users can save the places and activities they're interested in visiting.<p class="message sent">Brilliant! But A, let's not forget about security for the users. We need to make sure their information is safe.<p class=message>Totally agree. We'll need to implement strong security measures to safeguard their data.<p class="message sent">Well, let's get started on designing this new travel app. I'm excited to see how it turns out.<p class=message>Definitely! The possibilities are endless. I'm looking forward to it too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b8f83d86-ebb6-4c0d-8839-f6ed48cdcf05.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
