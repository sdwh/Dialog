Where are you headed to today?<p class=message>I’m going to Shenzhen to do some shopping. Have you driven there before?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, many times. I know all the good places to eat as well. Do you like spicy food?<p class=message>I love spicy food! What’s your favorite place to grab a bite in Shenzhen?<p class="message sent">There’s this great Sichuan restaurant that has the best Mapo Tofu, it’s not far from where we’ll be heading. You’ll love it.<p class=message>That’s awesome! Speaking of good food, have you tried any new restaurants lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, I went to a Japanese place last week that had some really unique dishes. Would you like me to recommend it to you?<p class=message>Sure, I’d love to check it out. Do you like trying new foods?<p class="message sent">I definitely do. Whenever I travel to new places, I always make it a point to try the local cuisine. What about you?<p class=message>Same here. I think it’s one of the best ways to experience a new culture.<p class="message sent">Couldn’t agree more. Hey, have you heard about the new ride-sharing service that’s been getting popular lately?<p class=message>Yeah, I’ve tried it once or twice. I still prefer taking a taxi though, it feels more secure to me.<p class="message sent">I know what you mean. Plus, with a taxi, you can have an actual conversation with your driver, like we’re having right now.<p class=message>Exactly. It’s a great way to learn new things too. You’ve been giving me some great recommendations so far.<p class="message sent">It’s my pleasure. Hey, we’re almost there. Have a great time shopping in Shenzhen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7f77419a-a867-4bc2-8387-f93b0d972e1f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
