How about you?<p class=message>I can't complain. I'm excited to prepare tonight's dinner menu. What dish do you recommend we serve?<p class="message sent">Our guests have been raving about the grilled salmon with lemon butter sauce. It's definitely a crowd pleaser!<p class=message>Sounds delicious! I will get started on that right away. Are there any guests with special dietary restrictions we need to be aware of?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a couple of guests who are gluten-free, so we need to make sure to have some gluten-free options available.<p class=message>Not a problem, I'll make sure to prepare some gluten-free sides. By the way, have you tried the new coffee cake we added to the dessert menu?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's amazing. It's been flying off the shelves, so we might need to make more for tonight's dinner service.<p class=message>Good to know, I'll make sure to have enough ingredients on hand. Do you have any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm planning on going for a hike with some friends. How about you?<p class=message>I'm thinking of taking a day trip to the beach. I could use some relaxation time.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Enjoy your day off!<p class=message>Thanks, B. And thanks for all your help tonight. We make a great team!<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. Let's make tonight's dinner service a success!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f9c2a9c0-d480-4643-aba8-60c394a6b8e9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
