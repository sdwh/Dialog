How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you, A?<p class=message>I'm doing well too. How are the breads looking today? Anything new you want to recommend?<p class="message sent">Well, we don't have anything new today, but the croissants are looking especially crispy and delicious.<p class=message>Sounds great. Customers have been loving our coffee lately, especially the classic French roast. Have you tried it?<p class="message sent">Actually, I haven't had the chance yet. As a baker, my mornings are always hectic. But I do love the smell of freshly brewed coffee, it's so comforting.<p class=message>I know what you mean. Maybe we should do a coffee and bread pairing event one of these days. I think our customers would love that.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea, A! Speaking of events, we have the Strasbourg Food Festival coming up. Are we participating this year?<p class=message>Yes, we are! We'll be showcasing our classic French pastries and breads. We might even add a special flavor to our menu just for the festival.<p class="message sent">I'm excited. I heard the festival attracts foodies from all over France. It's going to be a busy weekend for us.<p class=message>Definitely, but it's going to be worth it. We get to showcase our skills and taste the best food the festival has to offer.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Alright, I better get back to baking. See you around, A!<p class=message>See you, B! Have a good one.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c3a4a880-7d3e-4177-b963-08b35290f98d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
