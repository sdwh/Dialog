Welcome to the Statue of Liberty. Are you enjoying your time here in New York City?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I've always wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty. It's so iconic.<p class=message>It definitely is. Now, let's get ready to take some photos! Have you thought about any poses or shots you want to capture?<p class="message sent">Hmm, not really. Maybe a classic one with me holding up my arms?<p class=message>Great idea! That's always a popular one. How about we also try one where you're pretending to hold the torch?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes! That would be so fun.<p class=message>Perfect. And let's not forget one where you're doing a silly face. That's always a keeper for the memories.<p class="message sent">Haha, sounds good to me. You really know how to make this experience fun.<p class=message>Well, that's my job! It's important to make sure our guests have a good time and leave with unforgettable memories.<p class="message sent">I can already tell this is going to be a highlight of my trip. Thank you for being such a helpful guide.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. Now, let's get to snapping those photos!
