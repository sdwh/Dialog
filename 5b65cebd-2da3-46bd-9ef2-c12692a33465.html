How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. Say, I wanted to touch base with you about the progress of our project this year.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. What's up?<p class=message>Well, I've been looking at our timeline and it seems our progress in the first half of the year needs some extra attention.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've noticed a few bottlenecks in the code that we need to work out.<p class=message>Right, and so I wanted to run through our progress for each month and see if we can come up with a more efficient plan.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. What's your schedule like?<p class=message>Let's grab a coffee and sit down together later this week. How about Wednesday?<p class="message sent">Wednesday works for me. How about we meet up at that new caf√© down the street?<p class=message>Sounds great. And we can catch up on some of the other news, too.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's been ages since we caught up. How's the family?<p class=message>They're good, thanks. We just took a trip to the beach last weekend. How about you?<p class="message sent">I've been busy with some side projects, but I'm hoping to schedule in a vacation later in the year.<p class=message>That's smart. We all need a break now and then.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, should we go over the progress report again now or save it for our meeting?<p class=message>I think we can save it for our meeting. We can use our time more productively by going over it together in person.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Well, it was good to chat with you, A. See you on Wednesday!<p class=message>Same to you, B. Looking forward to it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5b6402f4-26b0-4baa-a1a4-c5772dd6744e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
