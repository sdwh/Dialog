My name is Officer A and I will be conducting an investigation with you today.<p class="message sent">Hi Officer A. Am I in trouble?<p class=message>Not necessarily, sir. We just need to ask you a few questions regarding a recent incident that occurred in the area. Can you please give us your full name and address for the records?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. My name is John Smith and I live at 123 Main Street.<p class=message>Thank you, John. Now, can you tell us where you were on the night of the incident?<p class="message sent">To be honest, I was at home watching Netflix all night.<p class=message>Okay, and do you have anyone who can verify your alibi?<p class="message sent">Well, my cat was with me the whole night, but I don't think he is a reliable witness.<p class=message>Haha, I understand. We'll take note of that in our report. By the way, what kind of cat do you have?<p class="message sent">He's a black and white domestic shorthair. He's really cute and loves to cuddle.<p class=message>Oh, that's nice. I have a dog myself, but I've always wanted a cat. Maybe I should visit the animal shelter this weekend.<p class="message sent">You should! Cats are great companions.<p class=message>I will definitely consider it. Alright John, that's all we need for now. Thank you for your cooperation.<p class="message sent">No problem. Have a good day, Officer A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1758c8eb-d914-412e-9bd1-8fd59b85fd25.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
