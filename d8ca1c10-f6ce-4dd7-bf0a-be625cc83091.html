I'm the manager of this hotel. It's great to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you, A! I heard you're a foodie, so I thought you'd enjoy trying some local delicacies with me.<p class=message>Absolutely! What kind of food are we in for today?<p class="message sent">I thought we would start with some sushi! Did you know that the term "sushi" refers to the cooked rice, seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt, that's used as a base for various toppings?<p class=message>Actually, I didn't know that! I always thought sushi referred to the raw fish.<p class="message sent">That's a common misconception, but actually, another term for sushi that includes raw fish is "sashimi."<p class=message>Ah, got it! Speaking of raw fish, have you ever tried fugu?<p class="message sent">I have! Fugu is a dish made from the flesh of the pufferfish, which is highly toxic if prepared incorrectly. It's usually eaten in small amounts and considered a delicacy.<p class=message>That sounds like a risky dish to try, but I'm always up for new experiences. What else do you recommend we try?<p class="message sent">How about some tempura? It's a deep-fried dish that originated in Japan, usually consisting of battered seafood or vegetables.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds delicious! I always love trying new foods while traveling, and it's great to learn about the cultural significance behind each dish.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Food is such an important aspect of any culture, and sharing it with others is a great way to connect and learn.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Speaking of connections, have you worked with many tourists in your time as a tour guide?<p class="message sent">Tons! It's such a great job because I get to meet people from all over the world and share my knowledge about Japanese culture with them.<p class=message>That's amazing. What kind of cultural tips would you share with someone visiting Japan for the first time?<p class="message sent">Well, one important thing to know is that slurping your noodles is considered a sign of enjoyment and appreciation. Also, it's customary to bow when greeting someone or thanking them.<p class=message>Good to know! I'll have to remember that. Thanks for sharing all of this great information with me, B.<p class="message sent">Of course, A! It's been a pleasure sharing these culinary and cultural experiences with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d8c9d95b-0337-4017-a03c-c1bfa7e0e30b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
