I heard that we found some vulnerabilities during the recent scan. Have you been able to fix them?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yeah, we were able to patch most of them, but some of the issues needed a bit more attention.<p class=message>That's good to hear. It's always important to stay on top of these things.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. Do you have any tips for how we can prevent these vulnerabilities from happening in the future?<p class=message>One thing we can do is regularly conduct vulnerability scans and patch any issues as soon as they're discovered.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a good plan.
