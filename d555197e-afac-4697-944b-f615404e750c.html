What technology stack are we going to use for it?<p class=message>We're going to use ASP.NET Razor Pages. It's going to make the development process much smoother and efficient.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! I'm sure it will make our lives easier. Are there any new features we're going to add to the site?<p class=message>Yes, we're going to add a new login system that uses biometric verification. Users can easily access the site without having to remember their passwords.<p class="message sent">Biometric verification sounds impressive! How are we going to implement this feature?<p class=message>We will use a combination of facial recognition and fingerprint scanning. It's going to be quite interesting to see it in action.<p class="message sent">This is definitely a big project. Do you think we'll be able to meet our deadline?<p class=message>It's definitely going to be a challenge, but I think we'll be able to pull it off.
