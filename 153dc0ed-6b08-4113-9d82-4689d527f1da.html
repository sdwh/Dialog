How are you all doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Teacher A! I'm doing pretty well today. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thank you for asking. So, today we're going to learn about phrasal verbs. Have any of you heard of them before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have heard of them. They're verbs that are made up of two or more words, right?<p class=message>Great job, B! That's correct. Can you give me an example of a phrasal verb?<p class="message sent">Sure, one example would be "give up." It means to stop doing something.<p class=message>Excellent example! Can anyone else give me a different phrasal verb and what it means?<p class=message>Very good, C! You all seem to know your phrasal verbs well. Now, let's try to use them in sentences.<p class=message>Great sentence, D! That's a good use of the phrasal verb "catch up." How about you, E, can you give me a sentence?<p class=message>Perfect, E! That's another great example of using a phrasal verb in context.<p class=message>That's the beauty of learning English, F! You'll discover new things about the language all the time.<p class=message>That's a great idea, G! I'll see what I can come up with for our next class. Well, that's all for now. Thank you all for participating and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=153ae322-c858-416e-a1f6-9399e3af6117.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
