I'm planning a trip to Australia next month and heard it's a great place for vegetarians. Do you know any good veggie restaurants?<p class="message sent">Ah, yes! I'm a vegetarian myself, so I know some good spots. What kind of cuisine are you in the mood for?<p class=message>Anything really, as long as it's vegetarian.<p class="message sent">Well, there's a great vegan Thai place near the city center called Loving Hut. Their spicy tofu curry is to die for.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! Do they have anything that's not too spicy?<p class="message sent">Definitely! They have a delicious stir-fried vegetable dish that's not too spicy, but still flavorful.<p class=message>Awesome! Any other recommendations?<p class="message sent">If you're in the mood for some tasty burgers, you should head to Lord of the Fries. Their vegetarian burgers are seriously delicious!<p class=message>I'm sold! Any other places to check out?<p class="message sent">If you want to try something really unique, you should try Bodhi in the Park. It's a vegetarian yum cha, so you can try all kinds of delicious steamed dumplings and noodles.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds amazing! Any other places you'd recommend?<p class="message sent">Sure! If you're in Sydney, you have to try Lentil as Anything. It's a pay-as-you-feel vegetarian restaurant with delicious food.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a really cool concept. Thanks for all these great suggestions, I can't wait to try them all out!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=236c9285-ec0f-40d5-a87c-737c96ee9765.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
