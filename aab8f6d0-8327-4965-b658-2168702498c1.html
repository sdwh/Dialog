I'm a food processing worker who specializes in traditional candy-making. Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm a candy store owner. Great to meet you too! So, what kind of candy do you specialize in making?<p class=message>Well, in Chaozhou, we make a lot of handmade candies with unique flavors like lychee, rose, and even durian.<p class="message sent">Durian candy? That sounds interesting. I'm used to making more mainstream candies like chocolate and gummies.<p class=message>Yeah, Chaozhou candies are definitely a little different. We use a lot of natural ingredients and put a lot of love and care into the process of making them.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. So, what kind of techniques do you use to make your candy?<p class=message>We use a lot of traditional techniques that have been passed down through generations, like boiling sugar syrup in a giant wok and kneading the candy with our hands.<p class="message sent">That sounds like hard work! Do you enjoy making candy?<p class=message>I do! There's something really satisfying about taking raw ingredients and turning them into a delicious treat that brings people joy.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Our shop aims to bring a little bit of happiness to people's days too. Have you ever tried to make any candy that didn't turn out as planned?<p class=message>Definitely! Candy-making is an art, and sometimes things don't turn out as expected. But that's part of the fun too - experimenting with different flavors and textures.<p class="message sent">That's a great attitude to have. I'm always trying to come up with new ideas for candy flavors too. Have you ever tried to put durian in candy before?<p class=message>Oh, definitely. Durian candy is actually quite popular in Chaozhou. It's a little bit of an acquired taste, but I think it's delicious.<p class="message sent">I'll have to try some next time I visit Chaozhou. Do you have any plans to expand your candy-making business in the future?<p class=message>Right now, I'm just happy to continue honing my craft and making the best possible candy I can. But who knows what the future holds?<p class="message sent">That's a great outlook to have. Well, it was really nice meeting you and learning more about traditional candy-making. Maybe we can collaborate on a candy project someday!<p class=message>I'd love that! It was great meeting you too, and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aab568b9-2232-475f-9fbe-37b5fa0e3a12.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
