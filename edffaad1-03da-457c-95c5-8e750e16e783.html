I was just gathering all my stuff together.<p class=message>Ah, gotcha. So, have you paid the bill yet?<p class="message sent">Nope, not yet. I was hoping you could help me with that.<p class=message>Sure thing. Let me check with the front desk to see what the damage is.<p class="message sent">Thanks a bunch! I'm hoping it won't be too expensive.<p class=message>(laughs) Don't worry, we split the cost, remember?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Oh yeah, that's true. Maybe we should've gotten a room with bunkbeds to save some cash.<p class=message>(laughs) No way, I need my beauty sleep.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Fair enough. So, what's the damage on the bill?<p class=message>Alright, so after adding up everything, it looks like we owe a total of $600.<p class="message sent">Oof, that's steep. Did we order room service every day or something?<p class=message>(laughs) No, it wasn't that bad. It looks like there were some extra charges, like for using the mini-fridge and some other amenities.<p class="message sent">(sighs) Well, I guess it's worth it for the amazing view we had from the balcony.<p class=message>Absolutely! Speaking of which, did you remember to grab your sunglasses from there?<p class="message sent">Oh shoot, I totally forgot. Thanks for reminding me!<p class=message>No problem. Oh, and don't forget to turn in your room key at the front desk!<p class="message sent">Got it. Thanks for helping me out. I couldn't have done it without you.<p class=message>Anytime, my friend. Ready to hit the road and head back home?<p class="message sent">You know it! Let's get out of here before we spend any more money. (laughs)<p class=message>(laughs) Agreed. Can't wait to get back to our own beds!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=edfdf401-5b74-496d-ba44-2a90cb9b0cc9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
