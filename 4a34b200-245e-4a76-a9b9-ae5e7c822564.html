I found a few bugs, but I think we'll be able to squash them before the release date.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, what do you think of the new software design?<p class="message sent">Honestly, A, it's a bit flashy for my taste. But as long as it's user-friendly and bug-free, I won't complain.<p class=message>Haha, fair enough. Speaking of user-friendliness, have you tested the new drag-and-drop feature?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It seems to be working smoothly. But I suggest we do a few more rounds of testing to ensure it won't crash when used with other programs.<p class=message>Good point. We don't want our users losing their work due to a glitch.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And speaking of losing work, have you tested the auto-save feature?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's working perfectly. I even tried to mess with it by disconnecting my computer from the power source, but the file was still auto-saved when I turned my computer back on.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to saving important files.<p class=message>Agreed. So, how's the coffee machine holding up? Still making your favorite brew?<p class="message sent">Oh, you know me too well, A. The coffee machine is a lifesaver, as usual. I don't know how I'd get through these long testing sessions without it.<p class=message>Haha, coffee is always a must-have in the office. Alright, B, back to testing we go. Let's make sure this software is perfect for our users.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, A. Let's get to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4a33e761-ce57-441c-a96c-39f5c773edbf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
