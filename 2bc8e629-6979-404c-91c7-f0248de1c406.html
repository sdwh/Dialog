What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, thanks for having me. I heard you sell some of the local specialties?<p class=message>Yes, we do! We have fresh seafood, dairy products, and some yummy snacks.<p class="message sent">Great, I'm always on the lookout for new things to try. What would you recommend?<p class=message>If you have a sweet tooth, you can't go wrong with the cheese tart. It's made with Hokkaido milk and it's heavenly.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! I'll take one of those. And perhaps some seafood to take home.<p class=message>Sure thing, we have some crab, shrimp, and scallops caught this morning. Which one do you prefer?<p class="message sent">I can't decide, they all look so fresh. Can I get a mixed pack?<p class=message>Of course. Anything else you'd like to try?<p class="message sent">How about that weird-looking root vegetable over there? What's it called?<p class=message>Oh, that's a burdock root. It's often used in Japanese cuisine for its earthy flavor and health benefits. Want to give it a try?<p class="message sent">Why not? I'm up for an adventure. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class=message>My pleasure. And don't forget to grab a box of chocolate-covered potato chips on your way out. They're a local favorite.<p class="message sent">Chocolate-covered potato chips? I'd never have thought of that combo. This town really knows how to surprise me.<p class=message>Indeed, we're full of surprises. Thanks for stopping by, hope you enjoy your goodies!<p class="message sent">I'm sure I will. Thanks for the great service, it's nice to shop at a store where the owner knows their products.<p class=message>You're very welcome. We take pride in offering the best of Hokkaido to our customers. See you next time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2bc4401d-7276-4e1a-9eea-523fea105678.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
