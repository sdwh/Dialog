So "perplexed" basically means to be confused or puzzled about something.<p class="message sent">Oh okay, I think I got it. Can you give me an example sentence?<p class=message>Sure thing. How about this one: "I was completely perplexed by the math problem and couldn't solve it."<p class="message sent">Ah, got it! So when you're perplexed, it means you can't figure something out.<p class=message>Exactly! The word is often used when something is more confusing than you expected it to be.<p class="message sent">I see. So does "perplexed" have any similar words?<p class=message>Good question! You could also use words like "baffled," "mystified," or "bewildered" to convey a sense of confusion or puzzlement.<p class="message sent">Interesting! Do you have any tips on how to remember this word?<p class=message>One way to remember it is by thinking of "plexus" which means "a network of nerves or vessels in the body." So "perplexed" could mean your thoughts or emotions are tangled up like a network.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a really helpful tip. Thanks!<p class=message>My pleasure! Do you have any other questions or would you like to learn another new word?<p class="message sent">Let's stick with "perplexed" for now, but I'll definitely come back for more vocabulary lessons.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Keep up the great work, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b840b9b6-26b0-4b54-a87e-2e7cf369f6f3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
