My name is A and I will be your local tour guide for today. Are you guys excited for exploring the sights?<p class="message sent">Yes, we are thrilled to be here. The scenery is breathtaking.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. What places would you like to visit first?<p class="message sent">We'd like to see the Cliffs of Moher, and maybe stop at a quaint seaside village for lunch.<p class=message>Excellent choice! Did you know that the Cliffs of Moher are the most visited natural attraction in Ireland? It's no wonder why though, they're absolutely stunning.<p class="message sent">We've heard a lot about them and couldn't pass up the opportunity to see them for ourselves.<p class=message>I'm sure you won't be disappointed. And for our lunch stop, there's a lovely village called Doolin that's known for their fresh seafood.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! Do they have any traditional Irish dishes?<p class=message>Yes, they have a dish called "Coddle" which is a traditional Irish stew made with bacon, sausage, potatoes, and onions. It's a very hearty meal.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious, sign me up for that!<p class=message>Great, I'll make sure to take you to a pub that makes a mean Coddle. But before that, let's enjoy the scenic drive to the Cliffs.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Thank you for showing us around and sharing your knowledge.<p class=message>My pleasure, you two seem like a fun group to tour with. Let's get going then!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=788a6518-6753-41d4-8c21-d650ade5b06e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
