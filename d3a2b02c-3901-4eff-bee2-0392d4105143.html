What's the plan for today's shoot?<p class="message sent">Hey there, my dear actor! Today we're going to shoot the funniest scene of the movie. You'll love it.<p class=message>Sounds great! Do I get to use any props?<p class="message sent">Yes, you'll be performing with a big, red balloon. Don't worry, it's not difficult. Just be yourself and have fun.<p class=message>Haha, that's easy for you to say. You're not the one who has to look silly on camera.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, you're a natural at comedy. Just trust your instincts and let your personality shine through. You're going to be amazing!<p class=message>Thanks, boss. That's really encouraging. By the way, have you seen the catering truck yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. Why, are you hungry already?<p class=message>Oh, I'm always hungry on set. You know me too well.<p class="message sent">Haha, I do. But let's finish the shoot first, we can't have any food babies ruining our perfect shots.<p class=message>You've got a point, boss. So, what's the plan after we wrap up?<p class="message sent">We'll review the footage and see what needs to be retaken. Then, we can probably call it a day and head home early.<p class=message>That sounds like a plan to me. I can't wait to see how this scene turns out.<p class="message sent">Me too. But first, let's get shooting! Are you ready?<p class=message>Born ready, boss. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d39de527-d48b-4458-a6a2-b528bc2b11a4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
