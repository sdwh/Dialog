I see you're stocking up on some of our Hokkaido specialties.<p class="message sent">Yes, I love your shop. You always have the best products. What do you recommend today?<p class=message>Well, we just got some fresh salmon in this morning. It’s caught locally and it’s absolutely delicious.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I’m not really a fish person. What else do you have?<p class=message>We have some amazing Hokkaido milk candies. They’re soft, creamy, and melt in your mouth. They’re popular with both kids and adults.<p class="message sent">Wow, those sound heavenly. I’ll definitely grab a bag. Do you have any favorite products in your store?<p class=message>Oh, that’s a tough question. I personally love our handmade pottery. The artisans in this town are incredibly talented.<p class="message sent">I’ve actually been looking for a new coffee mug. Do you think you have something that would suit my taste?<p class=message>Absolutely. We have all sorts of designs to choose from. And the best part is, you’ll be supporting a local artist.<p class="message sent">That’s perfect. I always try to support local businesses when I travel. So, what’s the most popular item in your shop?<p class=message>Our homemade miso soup is a customer favorite. It’s made with fresh ingredients and it’s a staple in Japanese cuisine.<p class="message sent">I’ll have to try that too. You’re making me hungry. Have you had any interesting customers lately?<p class=message>Actually, we had a group of tourists come in yesterday who spoke no English or Japanese. We had to communicate with hand signals and Google Translate!<p class="message sent">(laughs) That must have been quite an experience. It's amazing how service-oriented you are. I wish there were more shops like this.<p class=message>Thank you, B. We try our best to make sure everyone feels welcome here. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class="message sent">No, I think I’ve got everything I need. Thanks for the great service as always!<p class=message>Anytime, B. Enjoy your goodies and have a safe trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fade7f88-2fa3-4c96-8f01-b088fdbd78bb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
