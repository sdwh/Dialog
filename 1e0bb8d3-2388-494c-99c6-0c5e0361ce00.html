Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>How about some sushi? We haven't had it in a while.<p class="message sent">That sounds good. But I want to try something new too.<p class=message>Well, there's a new Thai place that just opened down the street. We could give that a try.<p class="message sent">Oh, I do love me some Thai food. Let's go there then.<p class=message>Sure thing. Do you want to go all out and get some pad Thai or try something more adventurous?<p class="message sent">Let's try something new. How about green curry chicken?<p class=message>Ooh, good choice! And we can order some spring rolls and tom yum soup to start off.<p class="message sent">Yum, I can't wait. Have you heard anything about their dessert menu?<p class=message>Actually, I have. They have mango sticky rice, which is a classic Thai dessert. It's so good.<p class="message sent">I've never tried that before, but I trust your judgement. Mango sticky rice it is.<p class=message>Great, sounds like we have our whole meal planned out. Can you believe it's already halfway through the week?<p class="message sent">I know right? Time flies when you're having fun. And speaking of fun, what are your plans for the weekend?<p class=message>I was thinking of going on a hike on Saturday and then maybe checking out that new exhibit at the art museum on Sunday. How about you?<p class="message sent">Well, my roommate is throwing a party on Saturday, so I'll probably go to that. And then on Sunday, I might just take it easy and catch up on some Netflix.<p class=message>Sounds like a pretty balanced weekend. I hope you have a blast at the party.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'm sure I will. And speaking of balancing, have you seen my chopstick skills? I'm pretty proud of them.<p class=message>Oh yeah? Let's put them to the test with this green curry chicken. Challenge accepted?<p class="message sent">You're on. Let's chow down!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1e04081a-4a89-40b5-9a10-2601b88a5223.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
