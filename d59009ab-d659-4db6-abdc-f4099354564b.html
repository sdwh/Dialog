Well, I'm a full-time lawyer and part-time amateur comedian.<p class=message>Wow, that's quite the combination! How did you get into comedy?<p class="message sent">I've always loved making people laugh, but it wasn't until a few years ago that I finally mustered up the courage to get onstage and give it a try.<p class=message>And how did your first performance go?<p class="message sent">Let's just say I learned the hard way that timing is everything in comedy. My jokes were falling flat left and right.<p class=message>Oh no! But it sounds like you didn't give up. What kept you going?<p class="message sent">Honestly, the thrill of the challenge. Comedy is tough, but when you hit that perfect punchline and hear the audience roar with laughter, it's all worth it.<p class=message>I can imagine. Do you have any upcoming shows?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I'll be performing at a comedy club downtown next Friday night.<p class=message>Awesome, I'll have to come check it out. Do you have a favorite joke you could share with us?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. How about this one: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything.<p class=message>(laughs) That's great. Thanks for taking the time to speak with me, and I can't wait to see your show next week.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Thanks for having me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d58fc095-9d4b-4450-aa49-1dcdd55bc832.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
