And did you know that it can greatly benefit companies in terms of data security?<p class="message sent">I can imagine. But how do they determine the sensitivity of the data?<p class=message>Well, they consider factors like the potential impact of a security breach, the level of confidentiality required, and the legal requirements.<p class="message sent">Ah, makes sense. So, what are the different levels of classification?<p class=message>There's public, internal use only, confidential, and top secret. Each level has different security measures in place.<p class="message sent">Interesting. I guess companies would have to invest in a lot of technology and personnel to make sure they're meeting the requirements.<p class=message>Definitely. But it's worth it to protect valuable data and prevent any security breaches.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, did you hear about that company that got hacked last week? They lost a bunch of sensitive information.<p class=message>Yeah, I did. That's why it's so important to have proper security measures in place. ISO 27001 can help prevent those kinds of incidents.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's better to be safe than sorry.<p class=message>Exactly. And with the increase in remote work due to the pandemic, data security is more important than ever.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I didn't even think about that. Companies need to make sure their employees are following proper security protocols when working from home.<p class=message>That's right. And using ISO 27001 can help ensure that those protocols are in place and being followed.<p class="message sent">Well, I'm definitely going to look into it more. Thanks for the info, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to geek out about data security with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ab689a3d-018c-4689-8bd7-fd1ed43770c4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
