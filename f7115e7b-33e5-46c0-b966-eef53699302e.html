Welcome to my car. Where are you headed to today?<p class="message sent">Hi! Thanks for picking me up. I'm actually just trying to find a good coffee spot around here. Any recommendations?<p class=message>Oh, sure thing! Melbourne has some of the best coffee in the world. Have you tried Proud Mary's? It's just a few blocks away.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. That sounds perfect, let's head there.<p class=message>Great! So, have you been to Melbourne before?<p class="message sent">No, it's my first time. I'm excited to explore- I've heard great things about this city.<p class=message>That's awesome! You'll love it here. What else do you have planned for your trip?<p class="message sent">Not sure yet, I'm still figuring out my itinerary. Do you have any must-see spots?<p class=message>Absolutely! Definitely check out the street art in Hosier Lane, and the beautiful views from Eureka Skydeck 88.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tips, I'll definitely add those to my list. How long have you been living in Melbourne?<p class=message>I've been here for about 6 years now. I love the city and all it has to offer.<p class="message sent">That's great! What do you do here for fun?<p class=message>Well, I love checking out all the new restaurants and bars that pop up. And I'm a huge sports fan, so I go to a lot of games too.<p class="message sent">Oh, which sports do you follow?<p class=message>Mostly AFL- it's the local footy league. Do you like sports?<p class="message sent">Not really, but I might try and catch a game while I'm here, just to get the full experience.<p class=message>That sounds like a plan! So, what do you do for a living?<p class="message sent">I'm a graphic designer, actually. How about you?<p class=message>I'm a full-time Uber driver, but I'm also studying to become a teacher.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. Good on you for pursuing your dreams while still working.<p class=message>Thanks! It can be tough, but it's worth it. Here we are, Proud Mary's! Enjoy your coffee, and have a great time in Melbourne.<p class="message sent">Thanks so much for the ride and the recommendations. Have a great day!<p class=message>No problem, take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f707b882-0469-4ebf-aff4-ea96db7ef1b6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
