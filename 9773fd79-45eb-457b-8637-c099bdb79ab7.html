How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm good, thanks. Just trying to navigate the traffic. How can I assist you?<p class=message>My friends and I are headed to Hokkaido for vacation. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's a beautiful place. The food is great, too.<p class=message>That's good to hear. We're looking forward to trying the famous Hokkaido milk and seafood.<p class="message sent">Definitely try the crabs and sushi. They're delicious.<p class=message>Sounds great! What other attractions do you recommend?<p class="message sent">You can't miss the lavender fields in Furano and the Sapporo Snow Festival in winter. They're breathtaking.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. What do you do for fun when you're not driving?<p class="message sent">I enjoy playing basketball and reading books. What about you?<p class=message>I like hiking and photography. Maybe we can exchange some tips during the trip.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. I'm looking forward to it. We should also try some local beer at the Sapporo Beer Museum.<p class=message>Of course! That's on our itinerary. Do you have any interesting stories about your job as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Well, one time a passenger forgot their phone in my car, so I went out of my way to return it to them. They were really grateful and even gave me a small gift.<p class=message>That's really kind of you. It's nice to hear positive stories like that.<p class="message sent">Thank you. It's little acts of kindness that can make a big difference.<p class=message>Absolutely. We're lucky to have you as our driver. Thanks for the great conversation!<p class="message sent">No problem. Have a safe and enjoyable trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=976f7c24-7a17-4917-94a5-a0040eb29d5d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
