How about "Bridesmaids"?<p class=message>Sounds like a good choice. I love Melissa McCarthy.<p class="message sent">Me too! She's hilarious. Have you seen "Spy" yet?<p class=message>Yeah, that one had me laughing from start to finish. I think she's the funniest actress in Hollywood right now.<p class="message sent">I totally agree. Anyway, let me go grab some snacks before the movie starts.<p class=message>Good idea. Maybe we can try that new popcorn flavor we bought last time.<p class="message sent">Ooh, the sour cream and onion one? I love that stuff.<p class=message>Yup, that's the one. And I also got some ice cream in case we get a sweet tooth later.<p class="message sent">You really are the best dad ever. Can't wait for the movie to start!<p class=message>Me neither. Hey, did I ever tell you about the time I met Kristen Wiig?<p class="message sent">No way! When was that?<p class=message>A few years ago at a comedy festival in New York. I got to chat with her for a bit and she was really cool.<p class="message sent">That's so awesome. Maybe we should watch one of her movies next.<p class=message>Great idea. We'll have to make it a comedy marathon night sometime soon.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Now, let's get comfy and get ready to laugh our heads off.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b3aac5a-fb45-4649-8887-03aaa0493890.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
