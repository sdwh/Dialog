How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there, I need to pick up my prescription for blood pressure medication. But I'm having trouble keeping track of all my pills.<p class=message>Ah, that can be tough. We see a lot of patients who struggle with medication management, especially as they get older. Do you have anyone who can help you keep track of your pills?<p class="message sent">My daughter stops in when she can, but she's busy with her own family.<p class=message>Well, we have a few tools that might help. We can provide pill boxes that are marked with the days of the week, so you know exactly which pills to take each day.<p class="message sent">That sounds helpful, but what about medication interactions?<p class=message>We can also provide medication reviews and coordinate with your healthcare providers to make sure all your medications are working together safely and effectively.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's great to know. I really appreciate your help.<p class=message>Of course, we're here to support your health and wellness. Do you have any other questions or concerns?<p class="message sent">No, that covers it.
