Good morning to you. Are you my delivery guy?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Yes, I am. I'm here to pick up the order for delivery.<p class=message>Sounds great! We have a lot of delicious sweets to deliver today. What's your favorite?<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough question. I love anything with chocolate, but your lemon bars are amazing.<p class=message>I completely understand. I love the chocolate croissants, but our lemon bars are definitely a customer favorite.<p class="message sent">Speaking of chocolate croissants, would it be too much to ask for one to keep me going on my deliveries?<p class=message>Not at all! I'll wrap one up for you. Don't eat too many deliveries while you're out there!<p class="message sent">(laughs) No promises. I love the smell of the sweets in my truck.<p class=message>I don't blame you. I love that smell too. It's one of the perks of working in a bakery!<p class="message sent">Definitely. By the way, how did you get into baking?<p class=message>Well, my love for baking started when I was young. I used to watch my grandmother make cakes, and I fell in love with the process. How about you, how did you get into delivery?<p class="message sent">My uncle started a delivery business and asked me to help out one summer. I loved it so much that I decided to make it my career.<p class=message>That's great! We all have passions that lead us to our career paths. Well, here's your chocolate croissant. Enjoy!<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! I'll be sure to savor it on my next delivery. Have a great day!<p class=message>You too, and good luck with your deliveries!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e4c85d57-3754-4368-9829-5cf954bada16.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
