How's everything so far?<p class="message sent">Everything's going well. We've got a lot of customers today.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm excited to make some sushi today. What would you recommend for me to try?<p class="message sent">If you're feeling adventurous, you should try making some uni sushi.<p class=message>Uni sushi? What's that?<p class="message sent">It's sea urchin sushi. It's a delicacy in Japan and the taste is quite unique.<p class=message>Alright, sounds like a challenge. But before that, can you teach me how to properly prepare the rice for sushi and onigiri?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'd be happy to show you. The key is in the seasoning and the way it's cooked.<p class=message>Got it, thanks for the tip. So, what kind of fillings do you usually use for your onigiri?<p class="message sent">We have a variety of options, such as salmon, umeboshi, and spicy tuna.<p class=message>Spicy tuna sounds interesting. Can I give it a try?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, I'll make one for you. By the way, did you hear about the new sushi contest happening in Tokyo?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's it about?<p class="message sent">Sushi chefs from all over the world are competing to see who can make the best sushi. It's going to be a tough competition.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds exciting. We should definitely try to join in next time.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Our sushi and onigiri are pretty great if I say so myself.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. I think our customers can tell as well. They keep coming back for more.<p class="message sent">That's the best compliment we could receive. It means we're doing a good job.<p class=message>I'm so glad we decided on this career path. Making sushi and onigiri is truly an art form.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. The satisfaction of seeing customers enjoy our food makes it all worth it.<p class=message>Couldn't agree more.
