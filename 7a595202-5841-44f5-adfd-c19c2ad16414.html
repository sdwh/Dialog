Looks like we're going to be performing surgery together today.<p class="message sent">Yes, good morning Nurse A! Another day, another operation. Do we have all the necessary equipment and supplies ready?<p class=message>Yes, everything has been checked and double-checked. I've already prepared the surgical instruments and cleaned the operating table.<p class="message sent">Excellent, thank you. How's the patient feeling?<p class=message>The patient is a bit nervous, but they're ready and willing to go through with the procedure.<p class="message sent">It's completely understandable to feel nervous before a procedure, but weâ€™ve done this so many times before with great success. I'm confident everything will go well.<p class=message>Agreed. Shall we double-check the patient's medical history and make sure we have the right consent forms signed before we start?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, let's do that. And while we're at it, can you hand me the blue surgical gown so I can change into it?<p class=message>Sure thing, I'll go grab it. By the way, I heard that joke you told earlier to the other doctors, about the medical puns. It was hilarious!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Ah, yes, I do have a knack for medicine-related jokes. It helps lighten the mood in the operating room.<p class=message>I definitely agree. Humor is the best medicine, after all.<p class="message sent">And speaking of medicine, have you decided where to have lunch today?<p class=message>Hmm, how about we try that new sandwich place near the staff lounge? I heard they have delicious vegetarian options.<p class="message sent">Sounds great. I'll treat you to sandwich and soda after we're done with this successful surgery.<p class=message>Thank you, Doctor! You always know how to make a nurse's day. Let's get started then, shall we?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, let's get to it. Scrub in and let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7a52247a-8906-4883-a2b3-27d8e92ba7ec.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
