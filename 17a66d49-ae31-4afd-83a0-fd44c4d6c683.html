How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. I need your professional advice on a legal matter that I'm dealing with.<p class=message>Sure thing! What's the issue?<p class="message sent">I'm being sued by my former business partner, and I need to know what my options are.<p class=message>Okay, let's take a look at the details. First things first, have you hired a lawyer yet?<p class="message sent">No, that's why I'm here. I heard you're the best in the business!<p class=message>Well, I wouldn't say the best, but I'll definitely do my very best for you. Let's discuss your defense strategy.<p class="message sent">Great! So, what do you suggest we do?<p class=message>We could go for a plea bargain and settle the case outside of court. Or we could fight it out in the court of law. It all depends on the specifics of your case.<p class="message sent">I see. Well, I definitely want to avoid going to court if possible. How long do you think this will take?<p class=message>That's hard to say. Every case is different, and it depends on a lot of factors. But I'll do everything I can to make this process as smooth and quick as possible for you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I really appreciate your help. You're making a stressful situation a lot more bearable.<p class=message>No problem, B. Just doing my job. And don't worry, we got this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=17a5bc69-e4f0-4b6e-a203-45a17aa88040.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
