Welcome to our tour of this beautiful historical site. My name is Sarah, and I will be your guide for the day.<p class=message>Of course! This site dates back to the 16th century, and was originally used as a fortress to guard against invaders. It was also used as a prison and later as a royal palace.<p class=message>One of the most interesting things about this site is that it served as the inspiration for a famous book series! Can you guess which one?<p class=message>You got it! Some of the scenes in the movies were filmed here, and the author visited the site for inspiration.<p class=message>We will be exploring the different parts of the palace, including the royal apartments and the chapel. We will also see the famous maze and the ornamental gardens.<p class=message>Yes, we have a full schedule to make sure we see all of the highlights. And don't worry, we'll make sure to take plenty of breaks for photos and rest.<p class=message>Definitely! The view from the top of the tower is breathtaking. You can see the entire palace grounds, and even catch a glimpse of the city skyline.<p class=message>My best advice is to stick together as a group, and try to avoid darting off on your own. It's easy to get lost in the maze, and we don't want to leave anyone behind!<p class=message>You're welcome, it's my pleasure to show you around. Let's get started on our journey through history!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8ce479c1-af47-4b88-839a-9205d4d09431.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
