How's business today?<p class="message sent">Hi there, A! It's been great so far. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. Everyone loves a good hot dog, especially when it's hot outside.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's true. Speaking of hot weather, I think your customers might appreciate something cold to go along with their hot dogs.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Why don't we collaborate and offer some of your delicious ice cream to our customers?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I have a new flavor I've been working on - pineapple and coconut. It's perfect for the summer.<p class=message>Sounds refreshing! And maybe we could even put it on top of our hot dogs for an extra twist.<p class="message sent">I like your creativity, A. Speaking of creativity, have you tried any new exciting toppings for your hot dogs lately?<p class=message>Actually, I have. We now have a spicy mango salsa to go with our classic chili dogs. It's been a hit with my customers.<p class="message sent">Spicy mango salsa? That's definitely a unique choice. I'll have to try that myself.<p class=message>You should! And in exchange, I'll try your new pineapple and coconut ice cream. It'll be a win-win for both of us.<p class="message sent">Deal! And who knows, maybe our collaboration will turn into something bigger in the future.<p class=message>I love your enthusiasm, B. Our streetside food businesses are just the beginning - one day we may even have a chain of restaurants together!<p class="message sent">The possibilities are endless, A. Let's keep working hard and see where it takes us.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7cb84e9d-f216-41ba-96e0-06b7d489c7fc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
