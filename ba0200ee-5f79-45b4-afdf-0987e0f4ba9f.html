How are you today?<p class="message sent">Hello, A. I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks. So, let's get started with the audit. I hope you're prepared.<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. My team and I have been busy preparing for this audit.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, can you tell me about one of the measures you've implemented to ensure data security?<p class="message sent">Sure. We've implemented two-factor authentication for all employees accessing sensitive information.<p class=message>That's a good measure. Have you faced any challenges with implementing it?<p class="message sent">Well, some employees found it inconvenient to enter the second factor each time they log in. But after explaining the importance of the measure, they now understand its significance.<p class=message>That's understandable. So, do you have any interesting stories about any past audits you've undergone?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. During one audit, the auditor accidentally spilled coffee on his laptop, and we had to scramble to retrieve the data. We managed to recover it all, but it was a close call.<p class=message>Oh no! That must have been stressful. Well, I'm glad it all worked out in the end. Alright, that's all from my end. Thank you for your time and cooperation, B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It was a pleasure discussing our security measures with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b9fef399-2f01-4568-b87d-5177b1dae4d3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
