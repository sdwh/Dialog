How are you doing?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well also. This is such a lovely day to serve our customers with delicious food.<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed! Did you try the muffins I baked this morning? They're to die for.<p class=message>No, I haven't. But, I trust your skills. What type of muffins did you make?<p class="message sent">Blueberry and chocolate chip. The aroma is irresistible.<p class=message>Sounds mouth-watering! I'm sure our guests will love them. By the way, do you have any new recipe ideas for our menu?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I was thinking of adding some cupcakes flavors like salted caramel, coconut, and even some gluten-free options.<p class=message>That's fantastic! I'm sure these new cupcakes will be a hit. Our guests appreciate different options. And, what about savory dishes?<p class="message sent">For entrees, how about French onion soup, stroganoff, and roasted vegetable lasagna?<p class=message>Those are some great suggestions. I'm excited to add these to our menu. Did you know today is National Chocolate Day?<p class="message sent">Really? How fun! We should celebrate by making some chocolate bonbons or truffles.<p class=message>Yes, that's a great idea. I'll add that to our specials board. Speaking of specials, we could offer a meal deal with our new entree dishes and your cupcakes.<p class="message sent">Excellent idea! It will encourage guests to try our new items.<p class=message>Yes, and it will boost our sales. Thank you for sharing your ideas, B. You're always coming up with fresh options to please our guests.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure, A. It's always a pleasure working with you. Let's show them what we're made of!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=240c0a20-99d8-493f-ace2-07226b2dc7d8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
