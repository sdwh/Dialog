I'm the tea master for today's session. Have you had a chance to taste any of our teas?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've tried the green tea and I must say, it's excellent.<p class=message>That's wonderful to hear! I'm glad you're enjoying it. Today, we'll be learning about pairing tea with different types of dishes. Are there any specific dishes you'd like to experiment with?<p class="message sent">Well, we're known for our Kobe beef dishes, so perhaps we could start with that?<p class=message>Of course! For Kobe beef, I recommend a robust black tea like Assam or Ceylon. It balances the rich flavor of the beef.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. What about our seafood dishes?<p class=message>For seafood, a delicate white tea like Silver Needle or Dragonwell would work well. It enhances the natural flavors of the seafood without overpowering it.<p class="message sent">Interesting! And what about our desserts?<p class=message>For desserts, I suggest a sweet oolong like Amber or Milk Oolong. It complements the sweetness of the desserts and cleanses the palate.<p class="message sent">These are great suggestions! I can't wait to try them out in our restaurant.<p class=message>I'm glad to be of help. Tea pairing is all about finding the right balance and enhancing the flavors of both the food and the tea.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's amazing how tea can enhance the dining experience.<p class=message>That's the beauty of it! Tea has a lot of health benefits too, it's not just about the taste.<p class="message sent">Speaking of health benefits, I've heard matcha is really popular in Japan. Can you tell me more about it?<p class=message>Yes, matcha is made from finely ground green tea leaves and contains a high amount of antioxidants. It's also known to help with concentration and energy levels.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's really interesting. I'll make sure to add some matcha options in our restaurant.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Let me know if you need any help with the pairing.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your help today. I've learnt a lot and I'm excited to apply it in our restaurant.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. I hope to see you again soon for another tea session!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=10df24a8-406c-4bcd-9376-6ec763259818.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
