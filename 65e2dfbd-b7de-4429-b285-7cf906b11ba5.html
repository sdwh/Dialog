It's nice to see you in the library. What are you reading?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm reading a novel by John Grisham. It's a legal thriller, which I'm finding really interesting.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds great! I've read a couple of his books too. Which one is it?<p class="message sent">It's called "The Firm". It's about a young lawyer who gets a job at a prestigious Memphis law firm, only to discover that something is not quite right with the place.<p class=message>Wow, that does sound like a page-turner. I might have to borrow that one from you when you're done. Have you read any other legal thrillers lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I just finished "The Lincoln Lawyer" by Michael Connelly. It was also really good.<p class=message>I've heard of that one. Was it more of a courtroom drama or a detective story?<p class="message sent">It was a bit of both actually. The main character is a defense attorney who operates out of the back of his Lincoln Town Car.<p class=message>That sounds pretty unique. I'll have to add it to my reading list. Do you have any other recommendations?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'd highly recommend "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn. It's a psychological thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through.<p class=message>I've heard a lot about that one too. I'll definitely have to check it out. Thanks so much for the suggestion.<p class="message sent">No problem! I always love talking about books with people. It's great to exchange ideas and opinions.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. There's nothing better than bonding over a shared love of reading.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=65e2920e-f258-438b-baac-9d70a84e7d93.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
