How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent message-content">Could be better, officer. But I guess that's to be expected when you find yourself in a police station.<p class="message received message-content">Understood. Now, let's get to the reason why you're here. Were you aware that you were trespassing on private property?<p class="message sent message-content">Trespassing? I had no idea. I was just taking a shortcut to get to the store.<p class="message received message-content">I see. And were you also aware that there was a "no trespassing" sign posted in the area?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, that sign. Yeah, I saw it. But I didn't think it applied to me.<p class="message received message-content">I'm afraid it applies to everyone, Mr. B. Nevertheless, I have to say that you seem like a rather honest and charming person.<p class="message sent message-content">(laughs) Well, thank you officer. That's certainly better than being called a criminal.<p class="message received message-content">(smiling) Yes, you're definitely not the hardened criminal type. But I still have to issue you a citation for the trespassing violation.<p class="message sent message-content">(shrugs) Okay, I understand. It's my bad. Thanks for not being too hard on me.<p class="message received message-content">No problem, Mr. B. You seem like a good guy, and I trust that you won't let this happen again.<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely. I've learned my lesson. And if I ever do find myself in a police station again, I hope it's under better circumstances.<p class="message received message-content">(laughing) I hope so too. Alright, we're all done here. You're free to go. Take care.<p class="message sent message-content">Thanks, officer. Have a good one.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=09ba521b-c95d-4d9b-a859-b7906484b433.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
