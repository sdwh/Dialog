I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>Not too bad, can't complain. Hey, I wanted to chat with you about our sales strategy for the next quarter. Have you had any thoughts on it?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been brainstorming a bit. I think we need to focus more on our online presence and social media marketing.<p class=message>Interesting. Have you looked into any specific platforms or tactics?<p class="message sent">Well, I think Instagram and LinkedIn would be good channels to explore. And I was thinking we could try some influencer partnerships to increase brand awareness.<p class=message>I like the sound of that. And what about our more traditional methods like trade shows and conferences?<p class="message sent">I still think those are valuable, but perhaps we could be more targeted with which events we attend and how we present ourselves at them.<p class=message>That's a good point. And speaking of trade shows, did you hear about the latest one in Las Vegas?<p class="message sent">No, what's up with that?<p class=message>Apparently they had a robot bartender handing out drinks. Can you imagine? Technology really is advancing quickly.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's wild. I don't think I'd trust a robot to make my margarita just yet.<p class=message>Same here. Well, thanks for the insight on the sales strategy, B. I'll take these ideas to the team and we'll see where we can make some changes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=de48344b-7d0c-4704-b3ca-9a55f304e910.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
