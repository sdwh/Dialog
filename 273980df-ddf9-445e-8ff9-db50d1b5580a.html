It's great to see you here.<p class="message sent">Hi, Professor A! Thanks for inviting me here. I'm hoping for an exciting discussion about the curriculum.<p class=message>Definitely! Before we start, would you like a cup of coffee?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's very kind of you. Yes, please. I would love one.<p class=message>So, let's dive into the topic. I wanted to discuss the course schedule for next semester.<p class="message sent">Sure, let's get started. What are your initial plans and ideas?<p class=message>We want to introduce a new course on digital marketing. We think it will be an exciting addition to our existing curriculum.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! What about the prerequisites for the course? Will students need to have any special qualifications?<p class=message>We are still in the process of finalizing that. We've decided that it will be an introductory-level course.<p class="message sent">That's perfect. What about class timings? Will the course be offered in the morning or evening?<p class=message>We’re planning to provide flexibility in scheduling. It will be offered at two different time slots during the week: one in the morning and the other in the evening.<p class="message sent">Nice! It's always a good idea to cater to students' schedules. What about the faculty who will be teaching the course?<p class=message>We’ll be recruiting industry experts to teach this course. They’ll be sharing their experiences and give insights on different marketing strategies.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic! I am sure it will be interesting for the students.<p class=message>Yes, we're hoping that it will bring some practical skills and knowledge to students. Do you have any suggestions for us?<p class="message sent">Well, from my experience, offering a practical project at the end of the course will enhance students’ learning and help them understand the practical use of the skills learned.<p class=message>That's an excellent idea! I'll make a note of that.<p class="message sent">Great! I'm excited to see this new course come to life.<p class=message>Me too! Thanks for your time and suggestions, Professor B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Professor A! It was a pleasure discussing the course with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=27390a1e-79ef-4cb0-88e6-044716703529.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
