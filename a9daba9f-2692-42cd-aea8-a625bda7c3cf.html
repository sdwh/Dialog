What have you seen so far?<p class="message sent">Well, we visited the castle ruins and went on a hike to see the Cliffs of Avalon.<p class=message>Those are both fantastic spots to visit. Did you happen to see any of the mythical creatures along the way?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I don't think so. Should I have been on the lookout?<p class=message>(laughs) Perhaps not, but it's always fun to imagine. What other activities do you have planned for your trip?<p class="message sent">We are hoping to take a boat tour around the peninsula and maybe try some local seafood.<p class=message>Oh, you definitely do not want to miss the seafood here. It's some of the best in the world!<p class="message sent">That's what I've heard. Do you have any recommendations on where to go?<p class=message>Well, there's a great restaurant down the road that serves fresh lobster and crab. You might want to give that a try.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! By the way, have you always lived in this area?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I love it here. It's a small community, but we have everything we need.<p class="message sent">It definitely seems like a great place to live. What do you usually do for fun around here?<p class=message>Hmm, well I enjoy hiking, fishing, and exploring the coastline. I also like to volunteer at the local animal shelter.<p class="message sent">That's so kind of you. What animals do they have there?<p class=message>Oh, all kinds! Dogs, cats, rabbits, and even some exotic birds. It's always a fun time.<p class="message sent">I bet it is. Well, thank you for all the information and for being such a great tour guide!<p class=message>It was my pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a9d78ec5-bc80-4ed5-93d6-1b3216e32274.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
