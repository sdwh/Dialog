How about you?"<p class=message>"Same here! I'm trying to optimize some of our database queries for better performance."<p class="message sent">"Ah, that can be a headache. Have you tried using any caching mechanisms yet?"<p class=message>"Yeah, I've implemented Redis as a cache store. It's been working great so far."<p class="message sent">"Nice! I've been using a lot of async/await functions to handle my API requests. It's made my code much cleaner and easier to read."<p class=message>"I agree! Async/await is a game-changer. Hey, did you hear about the new JavaScript features in ES2021?"<p class="message sent">"I did! The new logical assignment operators look really cool. I can't wait to use them in our code."<p class=message>"Definitely! And the new String methods too. They'll come in handy for any string manipulation we have to do."<p class="message sent">"Have you had a chance to try out Deno yet? I've been curious about it, but haven't had the time to explore it yet."<p class=message>"No, not yet. Although, I heard it supports TypeScript out of the box, which is pretty neat."<p class="message sent">"That's true! Speaking of TypeScript, have you run into any type-related challenges in our Node.js codebase?"<p class=message>"Actually, I have. I think we need to refactor some of our functions to have more explicit return types to prevent any potential bugs down the line."<p class="message sent">"Good catch. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Say, want to grab a coffee and brainstorm some solutions for that bug you mentioned earlier?"<p class=message>"Sure, I could use a caffeine boost. Let me just commit my changes first."<p class="message sent">"Sounds good to me. I'll meet you in the break room in 5."</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=868d1c02-4b52-401e-8476-cd2af22a40a7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
