How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi. I'm a bit confused about the legal terms and documents regarding my business. Can you help me with that?<p class=message>Of course, I'll do my best to clarify things for you. Can you give me some details about your business?<p class="message sent">Sure, It's a small bakery that I just launched a few months ago. I have some concerns about the legalities of it.<p class=message>Alright. Have you registered your business with the state yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I didn't know that was necessary.<p class=message>Absolutely. Registering your business is necessary, and it protects you from any legal issues that may arise. Also, you need to apply for a business license as well.<p class="message sent">Thanks for letting me know. I'm not used to all of this legal stuff.<p class=message>No problem, that's what we're here for. Anything else that you're worried about?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I also have some questions about employee contracts and what to do if someone gets hurt on the job.<p class=message>Those are excellent questions. It's important to have everything in writing and to have workers' compensation insurance to cover the cost of any injuries that may occur.<p class="message sent">Got it. Thanks for all the information. This is a lot to take in.<p class=message>Don't sweat it. Starting a business can be challenging, but it's also exciting. And you're not alone in this. If you have any more questions, just give our office a call.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks again for your help.<p class=message>You're welcome. Best of luck with your bakery!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a815ebaa-51ff-4c2c-81df-ebc52ba8a4ee.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
