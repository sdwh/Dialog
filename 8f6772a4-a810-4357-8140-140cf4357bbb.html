I heard you're working on a new desktop game.<p class="message sent">Hey A! Yes, that's right. We're going for a sci-fi theme this time.<p class=message>Oh, cool! I've always been a sucker for sci-fi games. What's the premise?<p class="message sent">Well, the player takes the role of a bounty hunter, hunting down dangerous creatures across the universe. There are various worlds to explore and boss battles to conquer.<p class=message>Sounds intense! What's the goal of the game?<p class="message sent">The ultimate goal is to become the most successful bounty hunter in the galaxy. As you progress, you earn credits to upgrade your equipment and unlock new abilities.<p class=message>Nice! I love games where you can customize your character. Speaking of which, can you customize your character's appearance?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We've included a character creation system where you can choose from different species and modify features like hair, eye color, and clothing.<p class=message>That's awesome! Now I'm even more excited to play. Is there multiplayer available?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a cooperative mode where you can team up with other players and take on challenging missions together.<p class=message>Sweet! I can already imagine teaming up with my buddies and taking down some epic space beasts.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's exactly what we're going for. We want players to have a great time and experience some awesome sci-fi action.<p class=message>I have no doubt about that! When's the game getting released?<p class="message sent">It's currently in development, but we're hoping to release it by the end of the year.<p class=message>Can't wait! Thanks for sharing, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the game once it's out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8f634a05-23ee-4c8c-82c4-802b6af3c199.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
