We need to make sure that their data is safe and secure from any cyber threats.<p class=message>Absolutely. One way we can do that is by regularly updating our security systems and firewalls.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we also need to make sure that everyone knows the basic rules of cybersecurity. For instance, not sharing passwords, avoiding clicking on suspicious links, and using strong passwords.<p class=message>Good point. We should also consider conducting regular security training sessions for everyone in the institution.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I think we should also encrypt any sensitive data and only allow authorized personnel to access it.<p class=message>That's a great idea. By the way, have you heard of the recent cyber attack on a university?<p class="message sent">No, what happened?<p class=message>Apparently, the hackers stole the financial information of thousands of students.<p class="message sent">That's terrible! Hopefully, we can prevent that from happening in our institution.<p class=message>Agreed. We should always be vigilant and proactive in ensuring the security and privacy of personal data.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It was great discussing this topic with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7fab6ff4-cd55-4362-ba7e-058a30066b87.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
