How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. So, I was looking over the project schedule for the next few weeks and I wanted to get your input.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, what's up?<p class=message>Well, it looks like we're going to be pretty busy. I'm thinking we might need to adjust our priorities a bit.<p class="message sent">Okay, what do you have in mind?<p class=message>I was thinking we should focus on getting the core functionality working first, and then move on to more advanced features.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a solid plan. I think that would help us stay on track.<p class=message>Great, I'm glad you agree. How do you feel about the timeline for the next few weeks?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I think it's going to be a bit of a challenge. But I'm up for it, as long as we have a clear plan.<p class=message>Definitely, we don't want to get overwhelmed. How about we schedule some checkpoints to make sure we're on track?<p class="message sent">Good idea. And maybe we can even schedule some breaks to give ourselves a chance to recharge.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. So, let's focus on the core functionality first, set some checkpoints, and schedule some breaks. Anything else?<p class="message sent">Well, I think we should also plan for some testing and debugging time. That's always a critical part of the process.<p class=message>Yes, good point. We don't want to rush through that part. Let's make sure we budget enough time for it.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And one more thing â€“ let's make sure we communicate regularly so we're all on the same page.<p class=message>Absolutely. Communication is key. Thanks for talking this through with me, B. I think we're on track for a successful project.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=018cc8e5-cf82-4008-b484-ce334a091ed2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
