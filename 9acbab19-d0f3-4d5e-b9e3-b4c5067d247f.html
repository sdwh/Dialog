It was delicious!<p class=message>Oh, that sounds great! What did you like the most?<p class="message sent">Definitely the beef and the broth. The flavors were amazing!<p class=message>Yeah, I totally agree. And have you added all those sauces and herbs?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I had no idea what they were, but I added them all! It turned out to be really tasty.<p class=message>Haha, yes! It's always a fun experience trying to mix new flavors. Did you have any trouble with chopsticks?<p class="message sent">Not really. I'm not a pro, but I managed to have my noodles without making a mess.<p class=message>That's impressive. I remember my first time trying Pho, and it was a disaster. I ended up using a fork.<p class="message sent">Oh no! That's hilarious. But why didn't you use a spoon instead?<p class=message>I didn't know I could use a spoon! I thought it was all about the chopsticks.<p class="message sent">Well, you learn something new every day. Next time we eat Pho together, I'll teach you the spoon trick.<p class=message>Ha! Sounds like a deal. And we can try different variations of Pho too.<p class="message sent">Yes, there are so many options! I heard some restaurants offer vegetarian Pho as well.<p class=message>Really? That's interesting. I wonder how it would taste.<p class="message sent">We'll have to find out together. Maybe add some tofu for extra protein?<p class=message>Definitely. And some Sriracha for a spicy kick!<p class="message sent">Oh yes! Pho with tofu and Sriracha sounds like a delicious combination. Can't wait to try it out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9ac3c157-af84-4cc5-bb57-4d079dcc37ff.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
