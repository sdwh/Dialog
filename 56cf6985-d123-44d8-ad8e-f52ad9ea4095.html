How's everything going today?<p class="message sent">Hi A, everything is going well. It's a busy day today, lots of customers coming in.<p class=message>Glad to hear that! I have some new dim sum recipes, would you like to try them out?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'm always open to new ideas. What kind of dim sum did you come up with?<p class=message>I have a new Siu Mai recipe, with a twist. Instead of pork, I used duck meat.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious! I'll definitely try that out.<p class=message>Perfect! And I also have a new dessert idea. I was thinking of making a durian cream puff with a green tea filling.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not sure about combining those two flavors, but I'm up for the challenge.<p class=message>Great! Let's work on that together. By the way, your mango sago is selling like hotcakes, everyone loves it!<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. I'm glad to hear that. I put a lot of effort into perfecting the recipe.<p class=message>You can definitely taste the quality in your desserts. That's why our customers keep coming back.<p class="message sent">We make a great team, A. You provide the amazing dim sum, and I provide the delicious desserts.<p class=message>Yes, we do! It's a perfect match.<p class="message sent">Speaking of matches, did you catch the game last night?<p class=message>I did, it was quite intense. Did you have a favorite team?<p class="message sent">Well, being from Hong Kong, I always support any team from the city.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Well, hopefully they'll make it to the finals.<p class="message sent">That would be nice. But for now, let's focus on making our customers happy with our food.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's get back to work and continue to make Chinatown proud.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=56ce6633-831d-4587-b4e3-e4907960459e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
