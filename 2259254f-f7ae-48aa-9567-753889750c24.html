I've been having a great time preparing some of our signature seafood dishes.<p class=message>I have to say, your seafood dishes are always amazing. What's the secret?<p class="message sent">It's all about sourcing the freshest ingredients and cooking them just right. And of course, putting a little bit of love into it!<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Speaking of ingredients, have you tried the new batch of prawns we got in today?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have! They're fantastic. I think we should showcase them in a special dish tonight.<p class=message>Great idea! We can pair it with some of our sides and create an incredible seafood platter.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. And with the beautiful view of Chao Phraya river, our guests are in for a treat.<p class=message>Absolutely! I always love seeing the look on our guests' faces when they enjoy great food with a view like this.<p class="message sent">And that's why teamwork is so important in the kitchen and in the restaurant!
