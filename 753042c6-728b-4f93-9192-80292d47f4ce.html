But how are we going to do that? I heard the top management is scheduled to discuss this issue soon.<p class="message sent">Well, we could start by identifying our target audience and understanding their needs and preferences.<p class=message>That's a good point. We can also analyze our competitors' strategies and come up with something unique and different.<p class="message sent">And we should also focus on highlighting our strengths and advantages compared to others in the industry.<p class=message>Yes, but we also need to keep in mind the current market trends and changes in customer behavior.<p class="message sent">True.
