I find it really interesting!<p class=message>That's cool. I remember when I was your age, I wanted to be an astronaut too.<p class="message sent">Really? Why didn't you become one?<p class=message>Well, life took me on a different path. But I still enjoy learning about space and the universe.<p class="message sent">Do you think there's life on other planets?<p class=message>It's a possibility, but we don't have concrete evidence yet. It's an exciting thought, though.<p class="message sent">Yeah, imagine meeting aliens one day and learning about their culture!<p class=message>Haha, that would be something. But let's focus on the show for now.<p class="message sent">Okay, dad. Hey, did you know that the first dog in space was called Laika?<p class=message>Yes, I remember reading about that. It's amazing how far we've come in space exploration.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and who knows what we'll discover next!<p class=message>Absolutely, son. Keep nurturing that curiosity and maybe one day you'll be the one making history in space.<p class="message sent">Thanks, dad. I'll keep that in mind.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=85d8e682-116e-4a24-8457-d8a13666b142.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
