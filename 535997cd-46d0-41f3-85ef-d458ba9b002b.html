What are you doing in the kitchen?<p class="message sent">Hi, Mommy! I'm making a cake for us.<p class=message>Really? That sounds great! What kind of cake are you making?<p class="message sent">It's a chocolate cake with butter cream frosting, just the way you like it.<p class=message>Yum! I can't wait to try it. Do you need any help with anything?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! Can you help me mix the ingredients while I prepare the baking pan?<p class=message>Sure, no problem. Let me just wash my hands first.<p class="message sent">OK, Mommy. I've already measured out all the ingredients, so it shouldn't take us long.<p class=message>Wow, you're so organized. You must have learned that from me.<p class="message sent">Of course, Mommy! You're the best teacher.<p class=message>Thank you, sweetheart. You're doing a great job so far. Is there anything else you need me to do?<p class="message sent">Yes, please help me pour the batter into the pan while I lick the bowl.<p class=message>Ha-ha! OK, sounds like a plan. Let's get to work.<p class="message sent">This looks perfect. Now we just need to put it in the oven.<p class=message>Alright, I'll take care of that. How long does it need to bake for?<p class="message sent">About 30-35 minutes. But we'll know it's ready when we can smell the chocolatey goodness.<p class=message>Mmm, can't wait for that. While it's baking, let's clean up the kitchen.<p class="message sent">Good idea. We don't want Mommy to complain about a messy kitchen again.<p class=message>Ha-ha! You know me so well. I love spending time with you, darling.<p class="message sent">I love spending time with you too, Mommy. And I can't wait to share this delicious cake with you.<p class=message>Me too, sweetie. It's going to be so yummy!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=53584be3-7ca6-4b2b-8fd9-ce12629b3487.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
