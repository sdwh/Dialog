What's on the menu today?<p class="message sent">Morning, Chef! Today we have a special dish - Stir-fried Lobster with Ginger and Green Onions.<p class=message>Wow that sounds delicious! Did we get some fresh lobsters delivered?<p class="message sent">Yes, we did. I made sure to get the best ones in the market.<p class=message>Speaking of markets, I went to the wet market this morning and saw some interesting ingredients. Have you ever tried adding Chinese chives to our stir-fries?<p class="message sent">Chinese chives? No, we haven't. Do you think they would go well with our dishes?<p class=message>Definitely! They have a very unique flavor and they're also really healthy.<p class="message sent">Great idea, Chef! Let's add Chinese chives to some of our dishes and see how our customers like it.<p class=message>Speaking of customers, how was the feedback for our new dim sum dishes?<p class="message sent">It was fantastic! Our customers really enjoyed the new additions to our menu and some even asked for the recipes.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Speaking of recipes, have you checked out the latest food trends on social media?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. But to be honest, some of them are just too gimmicky for me.<p class=message>I agree. It's important to stay true to our roots and continue serving authentic Cantonese cuisine.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Let's keep on serving delicious and authentic food to our customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f43ef89e-df31-4208-9d22-871d5c4df73e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
