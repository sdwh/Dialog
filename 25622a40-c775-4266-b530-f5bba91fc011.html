Thanks for seeing me today.<p class="message sent">Hello, A! How can I be of assistance?<p class=message>Well, I've been having some trouble with my breathing lately. I think it might be asthma.<p class="message sent">I see. Can you describe your symptoms?<p class=message>Yeah, I get really wheezy and short of breath, especially when it's cold or I exercise.<p class="message sent">That does sound like asthma. Have you had it before?<p class=message>No, this is the first time.<p class="message sent">Okay, well we'll need to do some tests to confirm the diagnosis. In the meantime, we can start you on some medication to help manage your symptoms.<p class=message>That sounds good. What kind of medication?<p class="message sent">There are a few different options, but I usually recommend an inhaler. You'll use it as needed to open up your airways and make it easier to breathe.<p class=message>Will I need to take it every day?<p class="message sent">It depends on how often you have symptoms. Some people only need to use it occasionally, while others need it every day.<p class=message>Got it. Is there anything else I can do to manage my asthma?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Avoiding triggers like pollution or cigarette smoke, and staying on top of your overall health can also help minimize symptoms.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice, Doc. I'm feeling better already.<p class="message sent">Great to hear it. We'll schedule some tests to confirm the diagnosis and then we can work on a long-term treatment plan together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=255f9dae-5b15-4342-b96d-3e43caffc8b8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
