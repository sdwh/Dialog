Welcome to the Melbourne Museum. My name is Sarah and I'll be your guide today. How can I assist you?<p class="message sent">Hi Sarah, I'm excited to explore the museum. Could you tell me what exhibits are popular here?<p class=message>Sure! Our visitors really enjoy the Forest Gallery, where they can learn about our unique flora and fauna. Another popular exhibit is the Melbourne Story, which showcases the city's rich history.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting! How about something that's a bit more quirky?<p class=message>Well, have you heard about our Phar Lap exhibit? It's about a legendary racehorse that captured the hearts of Australians almost a century ago.<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've heard of Phar Lap before. I'd love to check out that exhibit. Is it nearby?<p class=message>Absolutely! Just follow me and we'll head to the Sports Gallery. Phar Lap's exhibit is just around the corner.<p class="message sent">Great! I'm excited to see it. What other exhibits can we visit after that?<p class=message>Well, we have a Dinosaur Walk exhibit where visitors can step back in time and encounter life-sized dinosaurs. We also have a First Peoples exhibit that showcases the culture and art of Australia's Indigenous people.<p class="message sent">Wow, there's so much to see here! I think I'll need to come back another day to explore it fully. Thanks for the tour, Sarah.<p class=message>You're welcome! I hope you had a great time. If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f067619-5fdc-4b08-b6cd-b2985c11b3a5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
