On behalf of our restaurant, I would like to welcome you all and hope that you enjoy our food.<p class="message received message-content">This restaurant is known for its fusion dishes that incorporate traditional Australian ingredients like kangaroo, emu, and even crocodile. Have any of you tried any of these meats before?<p class="message sent message-content">Kangaroo is definitely one of our most popular meats here. But our menu also includes seafood like barramundi and Moreton Bay bugs, which are a type of lobster.<p class="message received message-content">And let's not forget desserts! One of the most famous Australian desserts is the pavlova, which is a meringue-based dessert with whipped cream and fruit toppings.<p class="message sent message-content">That's right, and we have our own special twist on the pavlova here. We actually serve it with a unique Australian fruit called the finger lime, which has a pop of tangy flavor.<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely. This restaurant is a great place to experience the fusion of traditional Australian ingredients and modern cuisine. Thank you, B, for the wonderful food and cultural explanations.<p class="message sent message-content">It was my pleasure. I hope you all enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0241919d-cdac-4e18-9ade-16d4e3586025.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
