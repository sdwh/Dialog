How about you?<p class=message>I’m excited to be headed to Sydney. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. Sydney is a great place to visit. What do you have planned?<p class=message>I’m meeting up with some friends, and we’re going to explore the city.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of fun. What are you looking forward to the most?<p class=message>I really want to see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. They look beautiful in pictures.<p class="message sent">They sure are! But be warned, the seagulls can be quite aggressive at the Opera House.<p class=message>Really? I’ll make sure to keep my distance then.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yes, I learned that the hard way. So, where are you from?<p class=message>I’m from Taipei. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven’t. But I’ve heard great things about Taiwan’s night markets. Have you tried stinky tofu before?<p class=message>Yes! That’s one of my favorite Taiwanese snacks. What about you?<p class="message sent">(laughs) I’ve tried it, but it’s not really my thing. I prefer something less… stinky.<p class=message>(laughs) Fair enough. I think Taiwan has a lot of delicious foods that aren’t as smelly.<p class="message sent">Definitely. But sometimes it’s the strange, smelly foods that end up being the best.<p class=message>(smiling) I can’t argue with that. Speaking of food, do you know any good places to eat in Sydney?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, there are plenty of great restaurants. What kind of cuisine are you in the mood for?<p class=message>I’m open to anything, really. Surprise me!<p class="message sent">(grinning) Alright, I have a few places in mind that I think you’ll love.<p class=message>Awesome, thank you so much! You’re such a helpful driver.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride to Sydney.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1290ceee-2527-4ba2-a67d-526e3a6c48c0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
