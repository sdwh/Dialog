What is it about?<p class=message>In brief, it's about ensuring that third-party companies handling your data and information are adhering to the same security standards as your own company.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So, it's like an extra layer of protection, like wearing two pairs of socks in winter?<p class=message>Haha, I suppose you could say that! It's all about mitigating risks and preventing data breaches.<p class="message sent">Got it. I'm glad we're talking about security in a light and fun tone, though. I was worried this conversation would be as dry as a mouthful of crackers.<p class=message>Don't worry, I'll sprinkle in some puns along the way. And speaking of crackers, did you know that a hacker once stole a cracker and used it to hack a company's system?<p class="message sent">(laughs) You're kidding me! I guess that's why you can never underestimate the power of a salty snack.<p class=message>(laughs) Exactly. Anyway, back to ISO 27001 Third Party. It can be a complex process, but it's important to ensure the security of our company's and customers' data.<p class="message sent">Yes, it definitely sounds like something we should take seriously. But let's not forget to also have some fun along the way!<p class=message>Absolutely! And who knows, maybe we can even incorporate some ISO 27001 Third Party-themed jokes into our next company social event.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Now that's something I'd pay to see!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9cb29589-efb5-4c69-bc2a-f5403e4df4ea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
