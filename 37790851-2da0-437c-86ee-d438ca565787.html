How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hey there! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thanks! I'm excited to be working here at this bakery. It smells amazing.<p class="message sent">Yes, it does! And I'm glad you're here. It's always busy in the mornings, and I could use some help.<p class=message>I'm happy to pitch in. What can I do to assist you?<p class="message sent">We have a few coffee orders waiting, if you wouldn't mind making some drinks while I get started on some fresh bread.<p class=message>Absolutely, I can handle that. What's your recommendation for a morning pick-me-up?<p class="message sent">I personally love our cappuccino, but we have a great house blend that's popular too. What do you usually enjoy?<p class=message>I'm a fan of lattes, so I'll make myself one of those too. What's your secret to making the perfect latte art?<p class="message sent">It takes a lot of practice and a steady hand! Honestly, there isn't too much of a secret beyond that. What about baking? What's your specialty?<p class=message>I'd say I'm best at making sourdough bread. It takes time and patience to get it just right, but it's worth it. What's your favorite type of bread?<p class="message sent">I'm a sucker for a good baguette. Nothing beats that crunchy exterior with a soft interior.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more! I actually just finished proofing some baguettes, so they should be ready to go soon.<p class="message sent">That's great! I can't wait to try some with my coffee.<p class=message>Here you go, two lattes and a cappuccino. Perfect for a busy morning.<p class="message sent">Thank you! These look delicious.<p class=message>No problem! And feel free to grab a piece of bread too - they're fresh out of the oven.<p class="message sent">You read my mind! I'll take two, please.<p class=message>Sure thing. Enjoy! And let me know if you need any extra help.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks again!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=377300b2-77a5-43f5-ba83-c9bc875bdc6a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
