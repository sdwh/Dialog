Before we begin, let's start with some simple stretches to limber up our muscles.<p class="message sent">Good morning, teacher! I'm so excited to try yoga for the first time.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Don't worry, yoga is all about listening to your body and taking it at your own pace.<p class="message sent">I've always been intimidated by the poses I see on Instagram, but I'm ready to give it a shot.<p class=message>We'll start with some basic poses and build up from there as your body becomes more comfortable with the movements.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me! Is it okay if I breathe through my mouth instead of my nose during class?<p class=message>Absolutely! Whatever feels most comfortable for you is best. And don't forget to focus on your breath - it's a key aspect of yoga.<p class="message sent">Will we be doing any inversions during this class? I heard they're good for reducing stress.<p class=message>We won't be doing full inversions today, but we'll definitely be doing some poses that help to relieve stress and tension in your body.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I could use some stress relief. I have a big exam coming up next week.<p class=message>I'm sure the class will help you feel more focused and calm for your exam. Let's get started with some sun salutations now.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, excited to learn!<p class=message>Great job, everyone! Let's end with some relaxation poses to help you feel refreshed and rejuvenated.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for the class, teacher. I feel so much better already.<p class=message>It's my pleasure! Keep up the practice and you'll see even more improvements. See you next time, everyone!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c43bf823-11a4-42fb-a02a-db357eafe445.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
