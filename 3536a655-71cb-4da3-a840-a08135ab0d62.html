How's the driving going today?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's going great! Just finished delivering some pigs to the butcher.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Thanks for helping us with the transport. So, what's on the agenda for today?<p class="message sent">I have a few deliveries scheduled, but I heard you had some new cattle in the farm. Any of them ready for transport?<p class=message>Yes, actually. We have a few healthy cows that are ready to be shipped out to the market. Can you help us with that?<p class="message sent">Of course! When do you need them delivered?<p class=message>How about tomorrow morning? That will give us enough time to load them and get them settled before shipping.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. I'll be here at 7 am sharp.<p class=message>Great! And while you're here, why don't I give you a tour of the farm? We have some new lambs that just arrived.<p class="message sent">That sounds really interesting. I've never seen a lamb up close before. Let's go!<p class=message>Sure thing. Follow me. *they walk around the farm talking about the animals*<p class="message sent">Wow, these chickens are really friendly. *petting a chicken*<p class=message>Yes, we take care of them well. They are an essential part of our ecosystem. *chuckles*<p class="message sent">Speaking of the ecosystem, I heard you guys are going green. What's that all about?<p class=message>We're trying to reduce our environmental footprint. We're going to start using solar power to run the farm.<p class="message sent">That's incredible. You guys really care about the animals and the environment.<p class=message>We do our best. It's important to take care of what we have. Now let's go see the cows!<p class="message sent">I can't wait to see them. *they walk to the cow pen*<p class=message>Look how healthy these cows are. They are going to make for some tasty steaks.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I can't wait to deliver them to the market. Thanks for letting me visit the farm.<p class=message>Anytime! It was great having you here. Have a safe trip and see you tomorrow. *they shake hands*</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=35360567-65b9-4eaf-bfe0-0d494dd20cbb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
