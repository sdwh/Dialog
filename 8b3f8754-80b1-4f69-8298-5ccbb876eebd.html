Welcome to our little store. How can I assist you?<p class="message sent">Hey, good afternoon! I'm a driver and I just wanted to get some snacks for the road.<p class=message>Sure thing! We have plenty of local delicacies you can try. Have you had Kitakaro's baumkuchen yet? It's a must-try!<p class="message sent">Baum-what? I've never heard of it.<p class=message>It's a delicious cake made with layers of batter, baked one at a time on a rotating spit. It looks like a tree trunk when it's cut!<p class="message sent">That sounds wild! I guess I'll take a couple of those.<p class=message>Sure thing! And have you tried the Hokkaido milk candy? It's our best-seller!<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it that good?<p class=message>Yes! It's made with fresh milk from local cows, so it's creamy and sweet. You won't find anything like it anywhere else.<p class="message sent">Okay, throw in a bag of those too.<p class=message>Anything else?<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe something savory? Like these seaweed snacks?<p class=message>Great choice! They're seasoned with soy sauce and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Perfect for a quick bite.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! I think that's enough for now. Thank you for your help, sir.<p class=message>You're welcome! Come back anytime, and have a safe trip on the road!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8b3c1583-cf22-4523-a71b-d2ca82042de0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
