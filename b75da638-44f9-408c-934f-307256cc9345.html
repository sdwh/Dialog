I'm excited to be heading to Hokkaido - have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Hello there! Yes, I have driven there quite a few times. It's a beautiful place to visit.<p class=message>That's great to hear! What are some places you'd recommend I visit while I'm there?<p class="message sent">Well, I highly recommend visiting the Sapporo Beer Museum and the Otaru Canal. Both are great tourist spots.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard about the beer museum before. Sounds like a fun way to spend an afternoon!<p class="message sent">Yes, it definitely is. And if you're up for it, there are some great skiing and snowboarding opportunities in the area as well.<p class=message>I'm not the best skier, but I'll definitely give it a try. Do you have any recommendations for a beginner like me?<p class="message sent">The Niseko Ski Resort is a great place for beginners. There are plenty of instructors there to help you get started.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Speaking of driving, have you ever had any interesting passengers in your taxi before?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've had quite a few interesting characters. One time, I even had a magician who performed some magic tricks for me during the ride!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a fun ride! Maybe you'll get lucky again and have someone interesting on your next trip.<p class="message sent">You never know! I always meet new and interesting people in my line of work.<p class=message>Do you have any favorite music to listen to while you're driving?<p class="message sent">I love listening to Jazz music. It helps relax me and sets the mood for a smooth ride.<p class=message>That's great to hear. We should definitely listen to some Jazz music on our ride to Hokkaido!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! I have a great Jazz playlist on my phone that we can use.<p class=message>Perfect! I'm looking forward to a relaxing and enjoyable ride to Hokkaido.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. Let's sit back, relax, and enjoy the scenic route.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b75bacc6-d415-49ce-863c-a2c5f7db4a79.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
