Are you also here to buy seafood?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I heard that ZhuHai is famous for its fresh seafood.<p class=message>That's correct! I am a farmer, and I came from a neighboring city to buy some seafood for tonight's dinner.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's interesting. And how do you plan to cook it?<p class=message>I was thinking of making some steamed prawns and fried squid. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm planning to make some grilled fish with soy sauce and ginger. Have you tried it before?<p class=message>No, but it sounds delicious. Can you recommend a good type of fish to use for grilling?<p class="message sent">Sure, you can try using the pomfret fish. It's one of the most popular choices and it tastes great on the grill.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. Do you have any tips for selecting fresh seafood?<p class="message sent">Always look for the clear eyes and shiny skin. Also, make sure to check if there's any unpleasant odor.<p class=message>That's very helpful. I will keep that in mind. By the way, do you know any good seafood restaurants around here?<p class="message sent">Yes, there's a great seafood restaurant just a few blocks away. Would you like me to show you the way?<p class=message>Yes, please! I can't wait to try some of the local cuisines.<p class="message sent">Great! Let's go, and we can also grab some fresh seafood from the market on the way back.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Thanks for your help!<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to assist!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7aee2dfa-d4fd-487f-b3d7-0d2c1056c1b6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
