Can you assist me?<p class=message>Of course! First, let's start with when you take your insulin.<p class="message sent">Usually in the morning and before dinner.<p class=message>Great! It's important to take it around the same time each day. Have you experienced any side effects with your current medication?<p class="message sent">No, not really.<p class=message>That's good to hear. It's important to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly. Have you tried any physical activity?<p class="message sent">I've tried swimming and it's been helpful.<p class=message>Perfect! And don't worry, you don't have to completely give up your favorite treats. Just make sure to eat them in moderation.<p class="message sent">That sounds doable. What about my blood sugar levels?<p class=message>Make sure to check your levels regularly, especially before and after meals.<p class="message sent">What about vitamins and supplements?<p class=message>We have several options that can help support your overall health, but be sure to check with your doctor first.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice.
