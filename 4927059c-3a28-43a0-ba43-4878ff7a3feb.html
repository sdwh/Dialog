Trying to figure out why this code isn't compiling.<p class=message>Yeah, I hate it when that happens. Want me to take a look?<p class="message sent">That would be great, thanks.<p class=message>No problem. Hey, did you hear about that new coffee shop that just opened up?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's special about it?<p class=message>They have this drink called the Rocket Fuel, it's supposed to have a crazy amount of caffeine.<p class="message sent">Oh man, sounds like my kind of place. We should check it out after work.<p class=message>For sure. Hey, have you tried out that new VS Code extension for code formatting?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class=message>It's called Prettier, and it's been a game-changer for me.<p class="message sent">I'll have to give it a try. Thanks for the tip.<p class=message>No problem. Hey, do you prefer tabs or spaces for indentation?<p class="message sent">Definitely spaces. Tabs are evil.<p class=message>Haha, I can respect that. I'm a tabs guy myself, but to each their own.<p class="message sent">As long as we're consistent, it doesn't really matter.<p class=message>Agreed. Hey, did you catch the game last night?<p class="message sent">No, I missed it. Who won?<p class=message>Our team won 3-2, it was a close one.<p class="message sent">Nice, I'll have to check out the highlights.<p class=message>For sure. Speaking of highlights, have you seen any good movies lately?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I watched The Social Dilemma on Netflix last night. It was pretty eye-opening.<p class=message>I've been meaning to watch that one, I've heard good things.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's definitely worth a watch.<p class=message>Cool, I'll add it to my list. Alright, I think I found the issue with the code.<p class="message sent">Awesome, what was causing it?<p class=message>Just a missing semicolon. Easy fix.<p class="message sent">Nice, thanks for your help.<p class=message>No problem, anytime. Let's get this project back on track.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=492231de-2462-46a1-a7f6-981c1ff2c976.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
