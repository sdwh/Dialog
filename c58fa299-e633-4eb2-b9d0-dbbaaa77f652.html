Can I help you find anything?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm looking for some more books to add to my classroom library. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Absolutely! What kind of books are you interested in?<p class="message sent">I teach third grade, so anything fun and engaging for that age group would be great.<p class=message>Have you checked out "The Wild Robot" by Peter Brown? It's a great book that my own kids loved at that age.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I haven't heard of that one. What's it about?<p class=message>It's about a robot who wakes up on an island and has to learn how to survive and make friends with the animals there. It's really clever and heartwarming.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! Do you have any other suggestions?<p class=message>Well, if you're looking for something with a bit more action, "Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief" by Rick Riordan is another popular one. It follows a boy who discovers he's the son of a Greek god and goes on a quest to save the world.<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've heard of that one. Sounds like it would be perfect for some of my more reluctant readers. Thanks for the suggestions!<p class=message>No problem at all. Let me know if you need help finding anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c589fd79-f6f0-44be-b495-7726f990dbe4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
