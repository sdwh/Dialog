I heard we're working on optimizing game graphics and interactions today.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. Our goal is to achieve smoother gameplay and better visual effects.<p class=message>Awesome, I've been looking forward to this. I think we can start by minimizing the number of textures and optimizing their sizes. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, and we should also think about using simplified meshes for objects that are far away from the camera.<p class=message>Good point. Another thing that can help is reducing the amount of post-processing effects like blur and bloom.<p class="message sent">Yes, but we still want to maintain some visual flair. Perhaps we can balance the effects by applying them only in certain situations, like during special attacks or cutscenes.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Speaking of cutscenes, I think we should enable the player to skip them if they want to. This will help maintain a good pace for the game.<p class="message sent">Agreed, and we can also think about adding subtle animations to the menus and buttons to make the game feel more alive.<p class=message>That's a good point. Lastly, I think we should consider implementing a framerate cap to ensure a consistent and smooth experience for players.<p class="message sent">Definitely, and we should also test the game on different devices to make sure it runs smoothly on all platforms.<p class=message>Great, sounds like we have a solid plan to optimize the game graphics and interactions. Time to get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=31080d29-9ad3-4a78-983c-ec32732bfc81.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
