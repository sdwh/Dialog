How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing good too. So, let's start the review process for your financial statements.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Although, I must confess, numbers are not really my thing.<p class=message>No worries, that's what I'm here for. Just remember to bring your sense of humor along with your documents.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Alright, I'll try my best. Can you give me a quick overview of what we're looking for?<p class=message>Sure. We want to ensure the accuracy and completeness of your financial information, so we'll be comparing your records to the documents you provided.<p class="message sent">Okay, that makes sense. Do you mind if I ask some questions along the way?<p class=message>Of course, ask away. That's how we learn.<p class="message sent">Great, thanks. So, do you have any good jokes to make this process less boring?<p class=message>(laughs) Actually, I do. Why did the accountant cross the road?<p class="message sent">Why?<p class=message>To get to the other spreadsheet! (both laugh)<p class="message sent">That's a good one. I think I'll use that at our next meeting.<p class=message>(smiling) Glad you liked it. Alright, let's get started. First up, your balance sheet.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's do this.<p class=message>(after a few minutes) Everything looks good here. Great job keeping your records in order!<p class="message sent">(relieved) Phew, thank you. And thanks for making this process less stressful.<p class=message>That's what I'm here for. And besides, it's always good to have a laugh in the office, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'm looking forward to telling that joke to my colleagues.<p class=message>(smiling) I'm sure they'll love it. Alright, let's move on to your income statement.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7b08b22d-9c07-488c-bcdc-c452cbc693bc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
