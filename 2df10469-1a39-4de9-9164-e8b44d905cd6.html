Do you have any new interesting teas that we can pair with our Chinese pastries today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Yes, I just got a new batch of Tie Guan Yin, a type of oolong tea that has a unique floral aroma. I think it will pair well with your lotus paste buns.<p class=message>That sounds great! I'll start baking them right away. By the way, have you tried the new green tea powder that came in last week? It makes a fantastic matcha latte.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had a chance to try it yet. But I'm pretty interested in it. Can I have a sample?<p class=message>Sure thing! How about I make us both a matcha latte after we're done serving these customers?<p class="message sent">That sounds like a wonderful idea. I had a long morning, and I could use a pick-me-up.<p class=message>Oh, tell me about it. I had to wake up at 5 am to prep the dough. But, it's worth it when we see our customers enjoy our creations.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. So, have you heard from our regular customer, Mr. Zhang? He usually comes in around this time.<p class=message>Oh, yes, he just called and said he's running a bit late today. He's bringing his granddaughter along as well, who wants to try our famous egg tarts.<p class="message sent">How sweet! I remember when my grandpa used to take me out for tea and pastries on weekends. I hope she likes them.<p class=message>Me too. I have a feeling they will be a hit. Anyway, I think the buns are ready. Shall we start serving them with our new tea blend?<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it. We are in for a busy afternoon. But, I'm excited about pairing your pastries with the TGY tea. It's going to be fantastic!<p class=message>Agreed. Let's get to work, and keep the customers happy with our delicious treats and tea.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2decc0cb-3e6a-42b4-8b49-495fd509970c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
