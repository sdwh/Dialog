How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great. So, today we're going to talk about idioms. Have you heard any interesting idioms lately?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think...I heard someone say "the early bird catches the worm" recently.<p class=message>Ah, that's a classic one. Do you know what it means?<p class="message sent">I think it means that people who wake up early and start the day early are more likely to succeed.<p class=message>Exactly! Another one that's similar is "the squeaky wheel gets the grease". Can you guess what that one means?<p class="message sent">I'm not sure. Does it mean that people who complain or speak up for themselves are more likely to get what they want?<p class=message>Yes, that's right. You're good at this! Now, let's try to make up our own idioms. How about "all's fair in love and ice cream"?<p class="message sent">(laughs) I like that one. Maybe it means that it's okay to indulge in a little extra ice cream when you're in love.<p class=message>(laughs) I like your interpretation. Okay, one more. How about "never trust a ninja with your pizza"?<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's funny. Maybe it means you shouldn't trust anyone who's too sneaky or secretive, even if they offer to share their pizza with you.<p class=message>(laughs) I think that's a good one. You have a great sense of humor, B.
