How about you?<p class=message>I've only tried it once at a restaurant, but it was amazing. Have you tried making it at home?<p class="message sent">Yeah, my mom used to make it all the time. It's a bit tricky to get the dough just right, but it's worth it.<p class=message>I've heard that it takes a lot of skill to get that perfect flaky texture.<p class="message sent">Definitely, but with practice, anyone can learn some new tricks.<p class=message>What do you usually have with your Roti Canai?<p class="message sent">I like to dip it in some curry or spicy sauce. It's so delicious.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I'll have to try that next time. Do you have any recipe recommendations?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I usually just go based on feel and memory, but I can find some good ones online.<p class=message>Awesome, let me know if you find any good ones. I want to try making it myself.<p class="message sent">Will do! And if you have leftovers, you can always make Roti Telur by adding some egg inside the bread.<p class=message>Wow, I never thought of that. Sounds like a great idea for breakfast.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Roti Canai is a versatile bread that can be enjoyed in so many ways.<p class=message>I can't wait to experiment with it. Thanks for the tips and ideas.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a548bfad-3d79-460a-ab4f-28330e82e2da.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
