Have you been?<p class=message>No, not yet. But I heard that there are some cultural differences between Cairns and other parts of Australia. Do you know anything about that?<p class="message sent">Yeah, there are actually quite a few things to keep in mind. For example, the indigenous people of Cairns have a strong presence and their customs should be respected.<p class=message>Right, I've heard about the Aboriginal culture. Is there anything specific to their language that I should know about?<p class="message sent">They have their own dialects and languages, but most people in Cairns speak English fluently. Just be mindful of how you communicate and try to avoid any offensive comments.<p class=message>Got it. What about the food? Is there anything unique to Cairns cuisine?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, definitely. There's tropical fruits like mangoes and papayas, as well as seafood like barramundi and prawns. And you can't leave without trying some kangaroo meat.<p class=message>Kangaroo meat? That's interesting. Is it good?<p class="message sent">It's definitely an acquired taste, but it's worth trying at least once. And the beer in Cairns is pretty good too. You have to check out the local breweries.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. What about the weather? I know Cairns is in the tropical north, so it must be pretty hot, right?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it can get pretty humid. Just make sure to pack light clothing and stay hydrated. And don't forget the sunscreen.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. So overall, what would you say is the most important thing to keep in mind when visiting Cairns?<p class="message sent">Definitely be respectful of the culture and customs. And don't be afraid to try new things. Cairns is a unique and beautiful place, and there's so much to explore.<p class=message>Thanks for the tips, I'm really excited to visit now!<p class="message sent">No problem, have a great trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=83270d16-1735-4946-82b2-b17474a8278d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
