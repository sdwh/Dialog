How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I'm interested in participating in an overseas exchange program.<p class=message>That's great! Which country are you thinking about?<p class="message sent">I'm torn between studying in Japan and France. Both seem so interesting!<p class=message>They are indeed. Have you considered the exchange program duration?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am looking for something that is about six months long.<p class=message>Well, the exchange program in Japan is typically five months long, while the one in France is six months long. Does that affect your decision making?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'll have to think about it. How about the language requirements?<p class=message>The program in Japan requires a basic level of Japanese, while the one in France requires intermediate French proficiency.<p class="message sent">I see. I'll have to start brushing up on my language skills. What about accommodations?<p class=message>Both programs offer homestay options or dormitory housing. It really depends on your preference and budget.<p class="message sent">That's great to know. I'm definitely interested in meeting new people and immersing myself in a new culture.<p class=message>That's one of the great benefits of participating in an exchange program. You get to experience a different way of life and broaden your horizon.<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm very excited! Thank you for all the information. I need to go discuss it with my family, but I'll definitely come back if I have any further questions.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. We are happy to assist you in any way we can.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=77157ca2-83e3-45d2-953a-d167d10119cb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
