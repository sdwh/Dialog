How about yours?<p class="message sent">Same here, just trying to use my lunch break to recharge.<p class=message>What did you get for lunch today?<p class="message sent">I got a salad with grilled chicken. I'm trying to be healthy this week.<p class=message>That's good. I got a burger, but I guess that's not the healthiest option.<p class="message sent">Hey, we all need a cheat meal every once in a while.<p class=message>That's true. So, have you seen the new guy in accounting?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I met him at the morning meeting. Seems like a pretty nice guy.<p class=message>That's good to hear. We could use some more friendly faces around here.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Speaking of friendly faces, have you seen the new puppy in the office next door?<p class=message>No way, there's a puppy in the office? I need to go see it!<p class="message sent">Yeah, he's really cute. His owner brings him in a few times a week.<p class=message>That's awesome. I wish we could have dogs in our office.<p class="message sent">You never know, maybe one day we will. But for now, let's finish our lunch break and get back to work.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Thanks for the company, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A.
