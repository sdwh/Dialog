How many times have you won in this game so far?"<p class="message sent">"Not much, really. I'm still trying to get the hang of it."<p class=message>"Don't worry, it takes time. Do you want me to teach you some tips and tricks?"<p class="message sent">"Sure, I'd love to learn from a pro."<p class=message>"Pro? That's quite an exaggeration. But thanks for the compliment anyway."<p class="message sent">"Well, compared to me, you are one."<p class=message>"Alright, let's focus on the game. Have you ever heard of bluffing?"<p class="message sent">"Yes, I have. That's when you pretend you have a strong hand to scare the others, right?"<p class=message>"Correct. However, it's not always effective. You have to know when to use it."<p class="message sent">"Got it. Are you bluffing right now?"<p class=message>"Who knows? Maybe I am, maybe I'm not."<p class="message sent">"Haha, you're so mysterious. Alright, it's my turn. Do you think I should fold or raise?"<p class=message>"Depends on your hand. Let me take a look. Hmmâ€¦ I think you have a good chance of winning. You should raise."<p class="message sent">"Thanks for the advice. I hope I don't regret it."<p class=message>"Don't worry, just trust your instincts. Oh, and speaking of instincts, have you ever played poker with dogs?"<p class="message sent">"What? No, I haven't. Is that even a thing?"<p class=message>"Yes, it is. There's an annual poker tournament in California where the players are mostly dogs."<p class="message sent">"Wow, that sounds hilarious. I can't imagine playing with animals."<p class=message>"It's all for a good cause though. The proceeds go to animal shelters and charities."<p class="message sent">"That's awesome. Maybe we can start our own dog poker tournament someday."<p class=message>"Sure, I'll bring my golden retriever. I think he has a good poker face."<p class="message sent">"Haha, that would be great. Okay, it's my turn again.
