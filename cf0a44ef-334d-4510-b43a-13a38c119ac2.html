I heard you're interested in learning ASP.NET Core?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I really want to get into web development and I heard that ASP.NET Core is a good place to start.<p class=message>Definitely! It's a powerful framework with a lot of potential. The first step is to get familiar with C# programming language.<p class="message sent">I see. Is it a difficult language to learn?<p class=message>Not necessarily. It has its challenges, but with practice and patience, you'll get the hang of it.

How do you suggest I start learning C#?<p class=message>There are a lot of resources available online. I recommend checking out Microsoft's official documentation, as well as Codecademy and Pluralsight courses.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll look into those. What's next after learning C#?<p class=message>After that, it's important to learn about the ASP.NET Core framework itself. There are a lot of concepts to understand, such as models, controllers, and views.<p class="message sent">I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.<p class=message>Don't worry, it's natural to feel that way at first. Just take it one step at a time and don't be afraid to ask for help. There are plenty of online communities and forums where you can get support.<p class="message sent">That's reassuring.

Pluralsight has a wide selection of beginner-friendly video courses that cover a variety of topics. Udemy and YouTube also have excellent resources.<p class="message sent">Awesome, I'll check those out too. Thanks for your guidance!<p class=message>Anytime!
