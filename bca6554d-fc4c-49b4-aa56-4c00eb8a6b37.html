Let's start our stand up meeting. B, could you please give us an update?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A. Yesterday, I debugged the code and fixed a few bugs. I also started working on the new feature for the app.<p class=message>Great work, B! How's it going with that new feature?<p class="message sent">It's going well so far. I'm almost done with the design, and I'll start implementing it today.<p class=message>That's awesome to hear. Any challenges or roadblocks you're facing?<p class="message sent">Not really, but I do have a funny story to share. I accidentally deleted a whole block of code, and I had to rewrite it all. It was quite a workout for my fingers!<p class=message>(chuckles) Oh no, we've all been there. Glad you were able to recover it. Thanks for the update, B. Anyone else have anything to share?<p class=message>Excellent, C! Do you think it will be ready in time for our next release?<p class=message>That's great news. Any questions, concerns or feedback on anything?<p class=message>(smiling) Thank you, D! We appreciate the positive feedback. Anyone else?<p class=message>Fantastic, E! I can't wait to see it. Keep up the good work, everyone. Let's have another productive day today! That's all for now.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bca3c1fa-4a5d-4449-ba7e-26f765c429ac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
