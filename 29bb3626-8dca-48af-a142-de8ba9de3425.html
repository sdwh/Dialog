I was wondering if you could help me take a look at the bathroom facilities in this hotel.<p class="message sent">Sure! I'd love to help. What are you looking for specifically?<p class=message>Just wanted to see if there's a bathtub. I love a good soak after a long day of exploring.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Let me check... Yes! There's a bathtub here. It looks pretty spacious too.<p class=message>That's great news! How about the shower? Is it separate from the bath or combined?<p class="message sent">It's a separate glass-enclosed shower. And the water pressure is fantastic!<p class=message>Wonderful. And the sink? Is there enough counter space for all my toiletries?<p class="message sent">Yes, the sink is pretty big and there's a lot of counter space. You won't have to worry about knocking anything over.<p class=message>That's a relief. And how about the towels? Are they fluffy and soft or scratchy?<p class="message sent">They're definitely fluffy and soft. And there are plenty of them too. You won't have to reuse the same towel all week!<p class=message>Haha, thank goodness for that. Thanks for your help in checking out the bathroom facilities. I have just one more question. Is there a hairdryer?<p class="message sent">Yes, there is a hairdryer. It's located in the drawer under the sink.<p class=message>Perfect! I think I'll be pretty comfortable here. Thanks again for your help.<p class="message sent">You're very welcome! Enjoy your stay here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=29b8e429-d206-4dd9-95f8-a818ce05bdc0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
