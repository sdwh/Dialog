Are you a student here?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. How can I help you?<p class=message>I'm a marketer and I was hoping to get some ideas on student recruitment.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. Well, we have a great campus and a lot of student organizations. Maybe you could highlight those things in your recruitment materials?<p class=message>That's a great point! What about the weather? We have some cold winters here.<p class="message sent">Hmm, true. But maybe you could highlight the winter activities on campus, like ice skating or hot cocoa socials.<p class=message>Great idea! What about social media? What platforms do the students here use the most?<p class="message sent">Instagram is definitely the most popular. Students love to show off their campus experiences on there.<p class=message>Perfect! I'll make sure to include that in our marketing plan. And how about non-traditional students? Do you have any suggestions on how to reach them?<p class="message sent">Maybe consider partnering with some local community organizations or adult learning centers. That could help you reach non-traditional students who may not be on campus.<p class=message>That's a great suggestion! Thank you so much for your help.<p class="message sent">No problem! Good luck with your recruitment efforts.<p class=message>Thanks! It was great talking with you. Have a good day!<p class="message sent">You too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ab0a9497-8f08-4f3d-834f-c98fa3011478.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
