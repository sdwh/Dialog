I heard we're designing a health insurance system for the cloud. As a cloud engineer, what do you think should be our first priority?<p class="message sent">Hi! Well, I think security should be our number one priority. We need to make sure that all the data remains confidential and secure.<p class=message>Absolutely, I couldn't agree more. And what about scalability?<p class="message sent">Yes, we should definitely make it scalable so that it can handle a large number of users and data without any lag.<p class=message>Right. And what type of database do you suggest we use?<p class="message sent">I think we should go with a relational database management system, given the amount of data and the complexity of queries that we'll have to deal with.<p class=message>That's a smart choice. And how about user interface?<p class="message sent">A simple and intuitive user interface should be our goal - this way, even less tech-savvy users can navigate the system easily.<p class=message>Sounds good. What about backups and disaster recovery?<p class="message sent">Both are important. We should have a backup system in place to ensure data is recoverable in case anything goes wrong.<p class=message>Yes, we can also implement disaster recovery protocols in case of a natural disaster, like a hurricane or earthquake.<p class="message sent">That's correct. Apologies if I'm fidgeting, I've been sitting here for hours! How about we stretch for a bit?<p class=message>That's a good idea. We don't want to risk any back problems while we're designing a health insurance system.<p class="message sent">Exactly! By the way, have you had a chance to try that new coffee shop on the corner?<p class=message>No, I haven't. But I heard they make the best coffee in town.<p class="message sent">They do! I can take you there during our lunch break, if you'd like.<p class=message>I'd appreciate that. Thanks for the suggestion!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4328716b-6a70-4e19-9b64-24f6125f7782.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
