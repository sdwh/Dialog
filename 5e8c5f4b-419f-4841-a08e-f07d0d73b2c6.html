It looks like we'll have another busy day at the café.<p class="message sent">Hi A! Yes, it's always busy here in Osaka. But I love it!<p class=message>Me too! So, which dessert have you sold the most this week?<p class="message sent">That would definitely be your signature cheesecake! It goes perfectly with our drip coffee.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I just made a fresh batch this morning.<p class="message sent">You know what would go well with that? Our new matcha latte! It's been a hit among our regular customers.<p class=message>Good idea, I'll make sure to recommend that combo to our customers.<p class="message sent">Speaking of customers, have you met the new regular who always orders the chocolate lava cake?<p class=message>Oh, him! Yes, he always asks for it to be heated up extra hot.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, he's quite the character. I always make sure to get it right, otherwise he'll send it back!<p class=message>(laughs) Well, we take customer satisfaction seriously.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Speaking of which, have you seen the reviews on our café's website? They're all glowing!<p class=message>That's fantastic news. It feels great to know that our hard work is appreciated.<p class="message sent">Definitely. So, what's new on the menu next week?<p class=message>I'm thinking of adding some seasonal fruits to our tart selection. And maybe a new coffee blend?<p class="message sent">Sounds exciting! I can't wait to try them out.<p class=message>Me too. Alright, let's get ready for another busy day!<p class="message sent">Let's do it. Coffee and cake, anyone?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5e8ae12e-1afb-423e-8a85-99ee6fe137b1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
