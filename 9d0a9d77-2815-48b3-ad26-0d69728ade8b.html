What is it?<p class=message>It's an Indian dish made of spinach and paneer - a type of cheese.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting. Is it spicy?<p class=message>Not necessarily. It depends on how it's prepared, but it can have a little kick to it.<p class="message sent">I like a little spice. Do you have a recipe you recommend?<p class=message>I do! My grandmother taught me how to make it, and it's delicious. Would you like me to send it to you?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! I'm excited to try it out.<p class=message>Just be careful not to burn the spinach. It can happen to the best of us.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the heads up. Maybe I should invite you over to make it together so we can avoid that.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can have a little cooking party.<p class="message sent">I'll bring the naan bread and you can bring the spices. Deal?<p class=message>Deal! I can't wait. Have you ever had mango lassi to go with the dish?<p class="message sent">No, but it sounds refreshing. Should we make that too?<p class=message>Definitely! It's the perfect compliment to Saag Paneer.<p class="message sent">This is going to be great. I love trying new foods and cooking with friends.<p class=message>Me too. Food and friends - what could be better?<p class="message sent">Nothing, except maybe enjoying it with a nice cold beer.<p class=message>Ah, a classic pairing. Sounds perfect to me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9d05b4cf-3ced-43e3-acc6-c9990d8b2372.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
