Have you ever tried Pad Thai? It's my favorite dish!<p class="message sent">Hey A! Yeah, I have! Pad Thai is amazing, but it can be a bit tricky to cook.<p class=message>Oh, definitely! But once you have the right mix of flavors, it's just the best thing ever.<p class="message sent">I agree, the balance of sweet, salty, and sour is crucial. And I think Pad Thai is one of the dishes that really highlights those flavors.<p class=message>Absolutely! And the mix of textures, from the noodles to the bean sprouts to the peanuts, just makes it perfect.<p class="message sent">Yes, that crunchiness is fantastic. How do you like your Pad Thai, A? Spicy or mild?<p class=message>I like it spicy, but not too much. What about you, B?<p class="message sent">Same here! I like it with a bit of a kick, but not so much that I can't taste anything else.<p class=message>Exactly! And have you tried Pad Thai with shrimp or chicken?<p class="message sent">I usually go for shrimp, but I've had it with chicken before, and it's just as delicious.<p class=message>Shrimps are my favorite too! And have you ever tried Pad Thai with a fried egg on top? It's so good!<p class="message sent">No way! That sounds amazing! I need to try that next time.<p class=message>You definitely should! And do you know that Pad Thai is probably the most famous Thai dish?<p class="message sent">I did not know that. But it doesn't surprise me. It's one of those dishes that you just can't help but love.<p class=message>Yes, everyone loves Pad Thai! And I think it's perfect for any occasion, whether you want to have it for lunch, dinner, or just as a snack.<p class="message sent">I totally agree. It's versatile and delicious, and one of those dishes that you just can't get enough of.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eec16752-d761-42c2-ad94-135c6d710647.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
