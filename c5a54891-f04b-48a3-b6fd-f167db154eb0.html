Are you excited for today's class?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I heard we're going to learn about some new grammar rules today.<p class=message>That's correct. It's an essential part of English learning. Speaking of which, I noticed you've improved your grammar skills lately.<p class="message sent">Thank you for noticing, teacher. I've been working hard on it.<p class=message>I can tell. Keep up the good work. By the way, have you checked out any new English movies or TV shows lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually, I've been watching a lot of British comedies. They're hilarious.<p class=message>Oh, I love British humor too. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely "The IT Crowd". It's one of my favorites.<p class=message>I've heard great things about that show. I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class="message sent">No problem, teacher. By the way, have you heard the latest joke about the English language?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What is it?<p class="message sent">Why was the math book sad? Because it had too many problems.<p class=message>Haha, that's a good one, B. You have a great sense of humor.<p class="message sent">Thank you, teacher.
