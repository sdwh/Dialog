It's basically a standard for information security management, right?<p class=message>You got it! It helps organizations ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by managing risks and applying controls.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds really important. I bet it's something you could talk about all day.<p class=message>Haha, you're right. It's definitely one of my favorite topics. But let's not bore everyone to death.<p class="message sent">Agreed. But I do have a question. What's the deal with the number 27001?<p class=message>Ah, good question. It's just the number assigned to the standard by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO for short.<p class="message sent">Got it. And I heard that getting certified for ISO 27001 is a big deal. Is that true?<p class=message>You're right again! It's a rigorous process but it shows clients and partners that the company takes their information security seriously.<p class="message sent">That's pretty impressive. I'm sure it gives them a competitive edge too.<p class=message>Absolutely. So, are you thinking about getting certified anytime soon?<p class="message sent">Haha, maybe not. But I'll definitely keep it in mind for the future.<p class=message>Hey, it never hurts to stay informed. And who knows, you could be the next ISO 27001 expert!<p class="message sent">Haha, maybe not. But it's good to learn something new every day. Thanks for the info, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Always here to share my knowledge about all things ISO 27001!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9c4759c2-6fa9-4853-9fbe-9a58980b99f2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
