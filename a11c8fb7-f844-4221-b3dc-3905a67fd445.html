My name is Adam, and I'll be your tour guide for today.<p class="message sent">Hi Adam, nice to meet you. I'm excited to explore this beautiful place.<p class=message>Great to hear that. Avalon is famous for its scenic views, legends and myths, and historical sites.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about these legends and myths?<p class=message>Sure. One of the most famous legends is King Arthur and his knights of the round table. According to the legend, King Arthur is buried here.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's so cool. I've always been fascinated with King Arthur and his knights.<p class=message>Yes, it's quite fascinating. Another interesting myth is the story of the fairy tree. It's believed that if you hang a piece of cloth on the tree and make a wish, the fairies will grant it.<p class="message sent">That's charming! I definitely want to try that out.<p class=message>Sure thing. We'll make a stop at the fairy tree so you can make a wish.<p class="message sent">Awesome! What other places are we going to visit?<p class=message>We'll also visit the oldest lighthouse in North America and some of the most beautiful beaches on the peninsula.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to see it all. By the way, have you ever encountered any fairies or ghosts while giving tours here?<p class=message>(laughs) No, I haven't. But some people claim to have seen them.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. Well, I hope I'll see some myself.<p class=message>(laughs) Who knows, maybe you will. Are you hungry? We'll stop for lunch at one of the best seafood restaurants in the area.<p class="message sent">Sounds great. I've heard that seafood here is amazing.<p class=message>You heard right. The lobster and cod fish are a must-try.<p class="message sent">I'm looking forward to it. Thank you, Adam, for showing me around.<p class=message>No problem, it's my pleasure to help. The tour is not over yet, we still have many places to see. Let's keep exploring!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a1158c0b-f323-4aaa-88dd-fa924f9cb3ff.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
