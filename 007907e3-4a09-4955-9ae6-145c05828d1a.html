How about we start by addressing the elephant in the room? Do you think we should build this system in-house, or use a third-party solution?<p class=message>I've been leaning towards using a third-party solution. There are so many options out there, and building in-house can be a resource-intensive process.<p class="message sent">I agree. Plus, using a third-party solution can also help us stay up-to-date with the latest technology trends.<p class=message>Good point. So, which service provider do you suggest we go with?<p class="message sent">I've been doing some research and I think Google Cloud Platform or AWS could be good options for us. They both have great tools for building scalable data processing systems.<p class=message>Sounds promising. Now, let's talk about the architecture.. Do you think we should go with a serverless architecture or a more traditional one?<p class="message sent">I'd say we should go with a serverless architecture. It's easier to manage and allows us to quickly scale our system depending on traffic.<p class=message>Interesting. What kind of data processing pipeline would you suggest for our system?<p class="message sent">We could use a combination of Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for real-time data processing, and Apache Airflow for scheduling and monitoring batch jobs.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. What about storage? Would you suggest using a NoSQL database or a SQL one?<p class="message sent">Depending on the nature of the data we're dealing with, we could go with both. It's always good to have options.<p class=message>Alright. Anything else we should consider?<p class="message sent">Well, we should also think about security and compliance. We need to make sure our system is secure and compliant with industry standards.<p class=message>That's a good point. We should definitely look into that. Overall, I'm excited about the potential of this data processing system.<p class="message sent">Me too! It's always a great feeling to work on something that has the potential to make a real impact on the industry.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0071c57c-2073-4a48-be24-c4f92d685700.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
