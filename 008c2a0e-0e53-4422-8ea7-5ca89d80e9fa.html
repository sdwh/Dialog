How are you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I'm doing great, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing fantastic as well. It's another beautiful day in Texas, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. Speaking of which, have you heard about the new BBQ-flavored candy we're producing?<p class=message>No, I haven't. BBQ-flavored candy? That sounds interesting.<p class="message sent">It sure does. We've been getting some mixed reviews about it in our quality control testing, but I think it has potential.<p class=message>Well, who doesn't love BBQ? Maybe we can even partner with some BBQ restaurants to sell it.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. But we need to make sure it meets our quality standards before introducing it to the market.<p class=message>Absolutely. Speaking of quality standards, have you seen the latest batch of our chocolate-covered strawberries?<p class="message sent">Yes, they came out perfectly this time. I suspect it's because we were singing to them during production.<p class=message>(laughs) That must be it! We should take turns singing to all of our products from now on.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. We'll have the happiest and tastiest candy and chocolates in the market.<p class=message>And the most musical, too. Hey, have you tried our newest flavor of lollipops? It's called watermelon-cucumber.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't tried that yet. Is it any good?<p class=message>Let me get you one. (A grabs a watermelon-cucumber lollipop and gives it to B) Here you go. Try it and tell me what you think.<p class="message sent">(tasting the lollipop) Wow, this is really refreshing. I think this flavor will be perfect for the summer season.<p class=message>That's what I was thinking, too. I'm glad you like it.<p class="message sent">All in all, I think we're doing pretty well with our candy and chocolate production.<p class=message>Agreed. And with our singing and taste-testing skills, the sky's the limit!<p class="message sent">(laughs) I couldn't have said it better myself.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=008a7890-33d5-46a6-b60b-68a95dd67862.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
