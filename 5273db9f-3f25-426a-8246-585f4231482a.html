Have you ever fed them any bread?"<p class="message sent">"Yes, I have! But mom says we shouldn't feed them bread, because it's not good for their health."<p class=message>"Your mom is right, we should only feed them seeds or oats. It's better for them."<p class="message sent">"Grandpa, do you remember when we went on this same walk last year and we found a lost dog?"<p class=message>"I sure do! That was quite an adventure. But we were able to find his owner and reunite them."<p class="message sent">"It made me happy to see the dog reunited with its owner. It was a good deed we did."<p class=message>"Yes, helping others makes us happy. That's why I always try to lend a helping hand whenever I can."<p class="message sent">"I want to be like you, grandpa. Always helpful and caring about others."<p class=message>"I'm glad to hear that, grandson. You can start small by doing little things for those around you, like opening the door for someone."<p class="message sent">"Okay, I'll try my best. Hey, grandpa, do you want to play a game of catch?"<p class=message>"Of course, I'd love to! Just let me stretch a bit first, I don't want to pull a muscle."<p class="message sent">"Haha, you're still as active as ever, grandpa."<p class=message>"Well, being active keeps us young.
