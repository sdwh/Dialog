What brings you to the library on this beautiful day?<p class="message sent">Hello! I have an English assignment due next week, so I'm trying to get a head start.<p class=message>That's great! What book are you reading?<p class="message sent">It's called "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee. Have you read it before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's a classic that's been around for ages. Are you enjoying it so far?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I love Scout's character and her curiosity about the world around her. What about you? What are you working on?<p class=message>I'm actually reading a mystery novel. It's called "The Girl on the Train" by Paula Hawkins. It's a page-turner, that's for sure!<p class="message sent">Oh, I've heard of that one. I might give it a try.<p class=message>You should! It's gripping from beginning to end. By the way, have you seen the art exhibit on the third floor? It's really fascinating.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it about?<p class=message>It's a collection of abstract paintings by up-and-coming artists. I checked it out earlier and it's really impressive.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. I'll make sure to check it out before I leave.<p class=message>That's a good idea. This library is full of treasures, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's amazing how many different things you can do here, from reading books to attending workshops.<p class=message>That's right. Did you know they also have language exchange programs here? You can practice speaking with someone who's learning your native language.<p class="message sent">No way! That's so cool. I might sign up for that. Thanks for letting me know.<p class=message>My pleasure. It's always good to learn new things and meet new people.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Well, I should get back to my reading. Thanks for chatting with me.<p class=message>Anytime! Good luck with your assignment.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5a307ba9-c82e-48b8-8475-ab282d2a3e5e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
