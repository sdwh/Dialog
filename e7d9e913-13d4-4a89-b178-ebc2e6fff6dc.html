I think they are quite delicious.<p class=message>I agree, they are very creamy and smooth. I like the way they melt in my mouth.<p class="message sent">Totally! And the seasoning is just right. Not too much, not too little.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's nice to have a side dish that complements the main course so well.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I think it's the perfect comfort food, especially on a cold day.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Sometimes, I even mix the mashed potatoes with gravy and it's like a party in my mouth.<p class="message sent">Haha, I do the same thing. It's like a whole new level of flavor.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have you tried the garlic mashed potatoes? They're even better.<p class="message sent">Ooh, no I haven't. I'll have to try them next time.<p class=message>You definitely should. They're a game-changer.<p class="message sent">Wow, I didn't think mashed potatoes could get any better. Now I'm excited to come back and try them.<p class=message>Trust me, you won't regret it. I think I need to order another bowl myself.<p class="message sent">Haha, I think I'll do the same.
