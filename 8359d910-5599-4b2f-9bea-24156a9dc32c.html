What is it?<p class=message>It’s a process to evaluate and check if an organization has proper security measures in place to protect its information assets.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. So, it’s like a security check or audit for companies?<p class=message>Exactly! There’s a list of controls that need to be in place for certification.<p class="message sent">Do you know what kind of controls are included?<p class=message>Yep! Some of them are access control, information security policies, risk assessment, and incident management.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like a long list. How does the assessment process work?<p class=message>Well, there are two stages. First, a preliminary review is done to assess the readiness of the organization. Then, a full assessment takes place, including document reviews and interviews with employees.<p class="message sent">I see. Is this assessment internationally recognized?<p class=message>Yes, it is! That’s why it’s called ISO – it’s recognized worldwide.<p class="message sent">Interesting. Is it difficult to get the certification?<p class=message>It can be a long and complicated process to get everything in order, but it’s definitely worth it for the certification.<p class="message sent">I see your point, but do you think it’s really necessary for every company?<p class=message>It really depends on the type of company and the importance of its information assets, but it’s certainly a good practice to have proper security measures in place regardless.<p class="message sent">Gotcha. It’s definitely something to keep in mind for the future.<p class=message>Definitely! We should start implementing some of these controls in our organization.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Let's start with information security policies.<p class=message>Great idea! And we can prioritize the other controls from there.<p class="message sent">Yes, and soon we can get our ISO 27001 Security Certification!<p class=message>That’d be awesome! Let’s get started on this security journey.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=83554442-8fee-4817-bdd9-6a22768cde13.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
