I'm on a mission to find some missing villagers. Have you seen anything suspicious?<p class=message>As a matter of fact, I have. I noticed some strange tracks leading in and out of the forest. Do you think they could be related to your missing villagers?<p class="message sent">That could be it. Can you lead me to where you found those tracks?<p class=message>Sure thing, follow me. By the way, have you ever tried elf bread? I have a delicious recipe I can share with you on our journey.<p class="message sent">I love trying new recipes. Is it difficult to make?<p class=message>Not at all. It's made with honey, nuts, and of course, our famous elf flour.<p class="message sent">Sounds tasty. Maybe we can make it if we find the villagers and have some time to spare.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Who knows, maybe we'll stumble upon a hidden treasure too!<p class="message sent">Now you're talking my language. We'll need all the extra coins we can get to buy ingredients for that elf bread.<p class=message>Haha, I like your style. Let's get moving and hopefully we'll find answers about those missing villagers soon.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And maybe on the way, you can teach me some of your superb archery skills.<p class=message>You got it, warrior. We'll work on your aim and I'll show you some tricks that have saved me many times before.<p class="message sent">Thanks, elf archer. With your help, we'll be unstoppable.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. Let's go, there's no time to waste!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a03d82d1-3ab7-4786-acae-46bb493ebb13.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
