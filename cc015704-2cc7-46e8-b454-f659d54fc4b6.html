How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, excited to get started on this new track.<p class="message sent">Me too. I was thinking we could maybe try adding some percussion to give it some more energy.<p class=message>That's a great idea. What kind of percussion were you thinking of?<p class="message sent">Maybe some bongos or a shaker to start. And we could layer some claps and snaps for that extra punch.<p class=message>Nice, let's definitely try that out. I was also thinking of maybe adding in some synth pads to give it a fuller sound.<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely. I'll start working on some ideas for that.<p class=message>You know what else would be cool? A guitar riff that could really stand out.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I think I have just the guitarist in mind for the job.<p class=message>Perfect. This is going to be our best track yet!<p class="message sent">I can feel it too. Let's get started and see what magic we can create in here.<p class=message>Yeah, let's do it. I'm excited to see how this all comes together.<p class="message sent">Me too, let's make some hit music!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cc010348-f89a-4c1f-a6e2-3a28f63782a1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
