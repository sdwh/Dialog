What can we do for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm in the mood for some sushi, do you have any options that include that?<p class=message>Absolutely! Our California Roll bento is one of our most popular options. Would you like some miso soup with that?<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds great. And can I also get a green tea to go alongside it?<p class=message>Definitely, one green tea coming right up for you! If you're interested, we also have some matcha latte options that pair great with sushi.<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe on another day. I'll need to see how much work I have to do after lunch before I make that decision!<p class=message>(laughs) I understand, work always comes first. But don't worry, we've got plenty of lunch choices to fuel you for the rest of the day.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. How long have you been making these bentos?<p class=message>Oh, I've been doing this for about five years now. It's become a bit of a passion of mine.<p class="message sent">And what about the tea? Do you have a favorite type to brew?<p class=message>Personally, I'm a big fan of genmaicha. The flavor of toasted rice mixed with green tea is really unique.<p class="message sent">That does sound interesting. I'll have to try it next time. Do you offer any special deals at all?<p class=message>Funny you should ask, we're actually running a promotion right now. If you buy any two bentos, you get a free tea on us!<p class="message sent">Oh, that's perfect. I was just thinking of ordering one to go for my coworker. Thank you!<p class=message>No problem at all. And if you ever have any special requests in the future, like vegan or gluten-free options, just let us know. We're happy to accommodate!<p class="message sent">That's really kind of you. I'll definitely keep that in mind. Thanks for the great service, A!<p class=message>You're very welcome, B. Enjoy your lunch and have a great workday!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=95d7a012-be8e-4171-aff5-4821633eb850.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
