Speaking of which, shall we start our first tasting?<p class="message sent message-content">I can't wait!

Both are aged in oak barrels and have a distinct flavor.<p class="message sent message-content">Let's start with the Chardonnay, please.<p class="message received message-content">Here you go. And I also prepared some hors d'oeuvres to go along with it. It's smoked salmon on a bed of cream cheese.<p class="message sent message-content">Mmm, delicious! The Chardonnay has a nice balance of acidity and sweetness. What cheese is in it?<p class="message received message-content">We use Hokkaido Brie cheese, which is a local favorite.<p class="message sent message-content">Great choice, A. I can taste the flavor in the wine. Let's try the Pinot Noir now.<p class="message received message-content">Certainly.

This wine has a nice fruity taste and the scallops are perfectly cooked.<p class="message received message-content">I'm glad you like it. Our aim is to complement the flavors of the food and wine.<p class="message sent message-content">You've certainly accomplished that, A. You must have a lot of experience in the culinary industry.<p class="message received message-content">Yes, I've been a chef for over 20 years. And I'm always expanding my knowledge and experimenting with new dishes.<p class="message sent message-content">Well, I must say, you're really good at it. I've never tasted such great pairing of food and wine.<p class="message received message-content">Thank you so much, B. It's all about understanding the flavors and making them work together.<p class="message sent message-content">You're definitely an artist in the kitchen, A. I can't wait to see what's next on the menu.<p class="message received message-content">I have a surprise for our dessert course. But for now, let's enjoy the rest of our tasting.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds great, A.
