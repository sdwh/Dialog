How about you?<p class=message>Great, thanks. I was thinking, for the game website we're developing, we could add some fun animations.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. I can handle the back-end development, and you can take care of the front-end.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. So, have you thought about any cool features we could add?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I was thinking about adding a leaderboard so players can see how they stack up against others.<p class=message>That's a good idea. Maybe we could also add some bonus levels with harder challenges to keep players engaged.<p class="message sent">I like the way you think. How about we also integrate a chat function so players can communicate with one another in-game?<p class=message>That's a great idea. It'll make the game more interactive, and players can make new friends.<p class="message sent">Exactly. Hey, have you heard about the new game that everyone's playing?<p class=message>No, what game is that?<p class="message sent">It's called Among Us. It's a multiplayer game where players have to find the impostor on their team.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard of that one. I haven't played it yet though.<p class="message sent">We should give it a try during our lunch break.<p class=message>Sure, sounds like fun. Do you think we could pick up any ideas from the game for the website we're building?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We could add some elements of deception and strategy, just like in Among Us.<p class=message>I like it. It'll make our game more unique and exciting.<p class="message sent">Great. It's always good to keep things fresh and interesting.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=22de6ee1-7074-43ca-9bc0-e2eda60554ef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
