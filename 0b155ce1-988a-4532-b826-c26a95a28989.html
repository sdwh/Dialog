Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I've just started learning about it in my cybersecurity course and I find it pretty interesting.<p class="message sent">It is definitely an important standard for information security management.<p class=message>Yes, and it covers a wide range of topics related to security management systems.<p class="message sent">That's right, it includes risk management, access control, and incident management among others.<p class=message>I was particularly interested in the certification process, have you heard about that?<p class="message sent">Yes, to get certified, a company must meet the requirements outlined in the standard and pass an audit by a certification body.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work, but I can see how it would be beneficial for businesses.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, having a certification can give customers confidence that their data is being protected.<p class=message>Do you think any companies have had trouble implementing the requirements?<p class="message sent">It's definitely possible, but with proper planning and policies in place, it's definitely achievable.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Have you heard of any examples of companies being successful with their implementation?<p class="message sent">I believe Microsoft and Amazon Web Services are both certified, and they set the bar pretty high in terms of security.<p class=message>Impressive! It's good to know that these big companies take security seriously.<p class="message sent">Definitely, especially with all the data breaches that seem to happen these days.<p class=message>Yeah, it's crazy how vulnerable we can be. I'm glad there are standards like ISO 27001 to help protect us.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, and it's always important to stay up-to-date with the latest security measures.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0b15488f-7420-4331-8310-0ad146e5cac8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
