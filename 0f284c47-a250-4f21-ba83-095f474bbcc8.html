How's everyone feeling?<p class="message sent">Good, good. Excited to run through our new setlist for our upcoming gig.<p class=message>Me too! So let's start with our opening number, "Rock and Roll All Night". I want to see everyone putting everything they've got into this one.<p class="message sent">Got it! I'm ready to give it my all on the drums.<p class=message>And remember, we're all in this together. Let's try to stay in sync as much as possible.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I think we could also work on the dynamics for "Don't Stop Believin'". It'll keep the audience engaged.<p class=message>Definitely. And let's not forget about our new song. The chorus needs to be a bit more punchy.<p class="message sent">Understood. I think we can add some harmonies to really enhance the chorus as well.<p class=message>Great idea. Alright, let's take it from the top and move through our set. We have a lot to do today.<p class="message sent">Let's do it! I'm excited to see how we grow together as a band!<p class=message>Same here. Remember, it's not about being perfect, it's about having fun and creating something we're proud of.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Let's rock this rehearsal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0f27ccf0-1bef-446d-bdfb-7de603d9343e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
