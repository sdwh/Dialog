I'm excited to roast some coffee beans here in Zhongshan.<p class="message sent">Welcome to the shop! Yes, it's always fun to roast coffee together. I’m always interested in trying out new blends.<p class=message>Well, I have a new recipe I'd like to try, it’s a mix of ethiopian and brazilian beans. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great combination, let's give it a go!<p class=message>Do you use any special roasting techniques here at your shop?<p class="message sent">We do indeed! We use a drum roaster and go for a medium roast that brings out the best flavor in each type of bean.<p class=message>Interesting! I usually prefer a darker roast for my personal coffee but I understand that lighter roasts bring out more of the bean’s natural flavors.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, each roast has its own distinct flavor profile. That's why it’s important to experiment with different roasts to find your perfect cup!<p class=message>I couldn’t agree more! Speaking of cups, do you have any favorite coffee mugs?<p class="message sent">Yes! I have a mug that says "Coffee is life" on it. It's my go-to mug every morning.<p class=message>Haha, I love that! I have one that says, "I like my coffee like I like my humor: dark and bitter."<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's a good one, I might need to borrow it sometime.<p class=message>Of course! So, have you been to any coffee conventions recently?<p class="message sent">Actually, I just got back from a conference in Taiwan. I learned some new techniques on coffee brewing and cake-making.<p class=message>Oh, that's wonderful. Have you updated your menu yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet but I plan on creating some new delectable treats soon. I'm always on the lookout for new baking ideas.<p class=message>Well, let me know if you need any help taste-testing those treats. But first, let's taste-test this new coffee blend!<p class="message sent">Absolutely, I’m excited to see how it turns out!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=10968f3e-67ca-46de-ad41-0da858d21c3e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
