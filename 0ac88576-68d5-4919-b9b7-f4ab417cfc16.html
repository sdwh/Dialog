I was wondering if you could guide me through the steps on how to use the indoor pool here at the hotel?<p class="message sent">Of course! I'd be happy to help you. To begin, you'll need to head to the front desk and grab a pool pass.<p class=message>Okay, got it. Where is the pool located?<p class="message sent">The indoor pool is located on the second floor of the hotel, and it's open from 6 AM to 10 PM daily.<p class=message>Great! Do I need to bring my own towel or are they provided?<p class="message sent">We have towels available for all guests in the pool area, so no need to worry about bringing your own.<p class=message>Awesome! Are there any rules or regulations I should know about?<p class="message sent">Yes, for safety reasons we ask that all guests refrain from diving and running around the pool area. Also, please shower before entering the pool to keep it clean.<p class=message>That makes sense. Is there a lifeguard on duty?<p class="message sent">There is no lifeguard on duty, so please swim at your own risk. However, we do have a first aid kit available in case of emergency.<p class=message>Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Is there a limit to how long I can stay in the pool?<p class="message sent">You can swim for as long as you'd like during the pool's hours of operation. But we do ask that all guests exit the pool area by 10 PM.<p class=message>Sounds good. Is there anything else I should know?<p class="message sent">Just be sure to have fun and enjoy your swim! If you need anything else, don't hesitate to come back and ask me or anyone at the front desk.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0ac74c75-fc27-431a-b1a8-547885ead654.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
