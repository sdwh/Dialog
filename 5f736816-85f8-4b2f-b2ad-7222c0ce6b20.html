How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, especially since the sun is shining today.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a perfect day to sell some fresh veggies and fruits. Speaking of which, what do you have in season right now?<p class=message>Well, we just harvested some delicious lettuce and radishes. We also have some juicy strawberries and apricots.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love strawberries! They're always a hit with my customers. How much are you selling them for?<p class=message>We're selling them for 4 euros per pound.<p class="message sent">That's a reasonable price. I'll take two pounds, please.<p class=message>Great! Thanks for your business. By the way, how do you like to prepare your strawberries?<p class="message sent">I usually just slice them up and mix them with some whipped cream. It's a classic dessert that never gets old.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. Have you tried incorporating them into salad?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Do you have any recipe ideas for a strawberry salad?<p class=message>Sure, you can chop up some lettuce, add some sliced almonds and crumbled feta cheese, and top it off with a strawberry vinaigrette. It's a refreshing and healthy meal.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing! I might have to try making that myself. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. I always like sharing new ideas for using our fresh produce.<p class="message sent">I can tell you're passionate about what you do. It's inspiring to see someone who takes pride in their work.<p class=message>Thank you, it means a lot to me. I believe that when you love what you do, it shows in the quality of your products.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, what else do you have planned for the market today?<p class=message>Well, we're hoping to sell out of our lettuce and radishes before the end of the day. We also have some zucchinis and eggplants that we're excited to showcase.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I think those veggies will be a hit with my customers. Thanks again for your quality produce and have a great day!<p class=message>Thanks, you too! See you next week.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5f707f7e-9cf7-438a-995e-a254e8c57b1a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
