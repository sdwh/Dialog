Can you give me some advice on how to sell them better in this market?<p class="message sent">Of course! What kind of products do you have?<p class=message>We specialize in different kinds of vegetables, fruits, and some organic meat.<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic! I suggest that you create some promo flyers and hand them out at the entrance. It might attract more people to visit your booth.<p class=message>Great idea! Do you think it's worth having a tasting section as well?<p class="message sent">Definitely! People want to try what they are buying before they commit to it.<p class=message>I like your point. What do you think about bundling up several products for a discounted price?<p class="message sent">That's an excellent opportunity to not only increase your sales but also introduce your customers to other products you've got.<p class=message>So true! Do you suggest any offer in particular?<p class="message sent">For example, you could bundle up some vegetables, a meat pack for grilling, and some fruits for a healthy dessert.<p class=message>Awesome. Lastly, what is your opinion on placing banners and signs across the market?<p class="message sent">It's also a good idea. Make sure to put up some creative signs that will grab people's attention.<p class=message>Thank you very much for your advice, I believe they will come in hand while I am doing promotion in this rural space.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ab9f92d9-251d-43b0-8b28-46d4b2116e12.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
