It sounds like a mouthful, doesn't it?<p class=message>Definitely! It's all about ensuring the security of sensitive information, though. Can't have any breaches.<p class="message sent">But, let's be real here - who hasn't accidentally shared a password or two?<p class=message>I know, right? Everyone does it. But, with ISO 27001, there's no room for mistakes!<p class="message sent">Well, that's a bit scary. So, what do we do if we realize we've messed up?<p class=message>Typically, we have to report it as soon as we can and learn from our mistakes. We even get a chance to improve our processes.<p class="message sent">Ah, so it's like a learning experience. That's not so bad.<p class=message>That's right! And honestly, it's better to be safe than sorry. Can't risk letting sensitive information fall into the wrong hands.<p class="message sent">You're absolutely right, A. Let's keep our eyes peeled and do our part in ensuring the safety of everyone's private data.<p class=message>Agreed! Now, did you hear about the company picnic next month? I heard there's going to be a pie-eating contest.<p class="message sent">Really? Count me in! Although, I don't think it's going to be as safe as ISO 27001 guidelines.<p class=message>Haha, definitely not. But, we'll take the risk for some delicious pies.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9da664d9-f36f-4cb0-8266-4a17262c2a4c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
