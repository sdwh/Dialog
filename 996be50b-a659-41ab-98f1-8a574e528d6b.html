I'm just going through the server logs now.<p class=message>Ah yes, the logs. Those can be a bit tedious, can't they?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but it's all worth it in the end. Security is paramount, after all.<p class=message>Absolutely. So, any interesting findings so far?<p class="message sent">Well, I did discover that someone had set their password as "password." You'd think we'd be past that by now!<p class=message>Oh dear, that's definitely not secure. Did you make sure to get that changed?<p class="message sent">Of course, I changed it right away. And I gave the user a bit of a lecture about password security.<p class=message>Haha, I'm sure they appreciated that. Hey, have you heard about that new cybersecurity training course?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it all about?<p class=message>It's called "Hack Me If You Can," and it simulates various hacking scenarios to teach employees about potential security risks.<p class="message sent">That's actually really cool! I think we should definitely look into that.<p class=message>Definitely. And on a lighter note, I heard you're quite the ping pong player?<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah, I do love a good game of ping pong. It's a great way to blow off some steam.<p class=message>I'll have to challenge you to a game sometime. Just don't take it too easy on me!<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'll try to go easy on you... at first.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=996bada1-b4eb-4379-a643-9f823a2d2fa8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
