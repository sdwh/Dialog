How can I help you today, sir?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon! I'm a travel agent and I have a group of tourists arriving in a couple of hours. Can you walk me through the immigration process?<p class=message>Sure, I'd be happy to. Firstly, they will need to fill out a landing card and have their passport and visa (if applicable) ready.<p class="message sent">Sounds straightforward enough. What happens after that?<p class=message>They will proceed to the immigration counter, where we will verify their documents and take their fingerprints and photo, known as biometrics.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Will they have to wait in line for long?<p class=message>It really depends on the number of flights arriving at that time. But we try to process everyone as efficiently as possible.<p class="message sent">That's reassuring to hear. Do you have any advice that I can give to my clients to make the process smoother?<p class=message>Yes, please advise them to have all their documents ready and to follow the instructions of our officers. Remind them that it's important to fill out the landing card accurately.<p class="message sent">Great advice. Thanks for your help!<p class=message>No problem at all. Is there anything else you need assistance with?<p class="message sent">No, that's all for now. Thanks again, you've been very helpful.<p class=message>You're welcome, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=43dd7d11-cb5a-44c9-97f6-e5c13b1723b7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
