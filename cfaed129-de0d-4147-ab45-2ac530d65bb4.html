Nice to meet you, B. You're a photographer, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct. I specialize in food photography. I'm excited to be here in Kyoto to learn the art of making traditional wagashi.<p class=message>It's great to have you here. I'm sure we'll have lots of fun. So, are you familiar with wagashi?<p class="message sent">A little bit. I know that wagashi is a traditional Japanese sweet that is often served with tea. I'm really looking forward to learning more about it and seeing how it's made.<p class=message>Yes, exactly! In Japan, the presentation of food is just as important as the taste. For wagashi, we take great care in the shapes, colors, and designs.<p class="message sent">That sounds fascinating. Do you think I could take some photos of the wagashi we make during our lessons together?<p class=message>Of course! That's a great idea. I would love to see your perspective on wagashi. And maybe you can also share some tips on how to capture the beauty of our creations.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I think we'll make a great team. By the way, do you have any favorite wagashi flavors or designs?<p class=message>I'm a big fan of sakura mochi. The pink color and the cherry blossom flavor are just perfect for spring. And as for designs, I like the ones with geometric patterns, like the kikko or the himmelreich.<p class="message sent">Those all sound yummy and adorable. I'm looking forward to trying them out. By the way, do you mind if I take some behind-the-scenes shots of you preparing the wagashi?<p class=message>Not at all. In fact, I think it would be great to show others how wagashi is made step by step. Let's make it happen!<p class="message sent">Sounds great! It's always fun to share the process and the final product. I think we'll have a wonderful time together. Thank you so much for your hospitality, A.<p class=message>No problem at all. I'm happy to be your guide in this wagashi adventure. Let's get started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cfadc47b-f9ba-4702-a3d9-12a91ff7344c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
