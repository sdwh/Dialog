Looks like we have some pretty serious vulnerabilities.<p class=message>Yeah, I was actually impressed by the thoroughness of the report.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's a good thing we hired those experts.<p class=message>Absolutely. But the real challenge now is to remediate those issues.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I've already started working on some of them.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I was thinking we could also see if there are any quick fixes we can implement.<p class="message sent">Good idea. We don't want to make any glaring mistakes.<p class=message>Exactly. Plus, it would be great to get those vulnerabilities patched up as soon as possible.<p class="message sent">For sure. I can work on some temporary patches while we identify and implement a long-term solution.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. And in the meantime, we can also prioritize which issues need to be addressed first.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And we can always reach out to the experts for guidance if we hit a roadblock.<p class=message>That's a good point. We're lucky to have such an amazing team.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's really all about teamwork at the end of the day.<p class=message>Couldn't agree more. Alright, let's get to work on those patches.<p class="message sent">Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bbd4d7de-1124-481b-a681-ea28fa8121c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
