Can you make me a famous Swiss drink, like Absinthe perhaps?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, coming right up! Have you had it before?<p class=message>A few times, but I'm always up for a new experience. What makes Swiss Absinthe special?<p class="message sent">Well, it's made with wormwood and other herbs that give it a unique flavor and a touch of bitterness. Plus, it's traditionally served by pouring cold water over a sugar cube on top of the drink.<p class=message>Sounds interesting! Do you have any other Swiss drinks you'd recommend?<p class="message sent">Definitely try a Swiss Martini. It's made with gin, dry vermouth, and a splash of absinthe. And if you're feeling adventurous, we have a special cocktail that includes Switzerland's famous cheese, Gruyere.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a wild combination. I'll stick with the Absinthe for now, though. How long have you been a bartender?<p class="message sent">Oh, about ten years now. I started out in college and never looked back.<p class=message>That's cool. What's your favorite part of the job?<p class="message sent">Definitely coming up with new recipes and experimenting with different ingredients. It's a lot like being a mad scientist sometimes.<p class=message>Ha! I can imagine. Do you have any tips for someone trying to make a good cocktail at home?<p class="message sent">Definitely invest in quality ingredients and take your time measuring everything out precisely. Oh, and don't be afraid to get creative and try new things!<p class=message>Good advice, thanks. Hey, this Absinthe is delicious! Thanks for making it just right.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, happy to help you enjoy a little taste of Switzerland!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b1bd688-c3da-46b3-b744-36dd58c645b5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
