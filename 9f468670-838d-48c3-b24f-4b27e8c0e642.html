Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm the network engineer. Pleasure to meet you too.<p class=message>So, we're here to discuss how to design a secure network infrastructure for this government agency.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's crucial that we protect sensitive information from hackers and cyber attacks.<p class=message>Absolutely. We need to start with a vulnerability assessment to identify any potential weak points.<p class="message sent">Once we have that information, we can start implementing security measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.<p class=message>And we should also make sure that all employees are trained in cybersecurity best practices to prevent human error.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we'll need to keep up with updates and patches to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are addressed.<p class=message>Agreed. And we should also consider implementing encryption for data at rest and in transit.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. And we can also set up a VPN for remote access to keep the network secure outside of the office.<p class=message>Yes, that's essential for those who need to access sensitive information from home or while traveling.<p class="message sent">And let's not forget about physical security measures like access control and surveillance cameras.<p class=message>That's right, we need to protect the physical infrastructure as well. This may seem like a lot, but it's necessary to ensure that all national security information is kept safe.<p class="message sent">I agree. Together, we can design a secure infrastructure that can withstand any cyber threats.<p class=message>Excellent. Let's get to work and make sure that we create the most secure network possible.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Let's get started.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9f425112-025f-40db-a6b4-353e8d64d841.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
