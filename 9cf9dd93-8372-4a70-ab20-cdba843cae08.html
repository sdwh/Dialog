So, how does it work exactly?<p class=message>Well, you can use various tools like Google Docs, Trello or Asana to share files, communicate and track progress.<p class="message sent">Cool! I've heard of those tools before.<p class=message>They can be really useful for staying organized.<p class="message sent">Do you have any tips for working collaboratively online?<p class=message>Sure! First, it's important to establish clear communication channels and set deadlines.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. What else?<p class=message>Another thing is to assign specific tasks to each team member so everyone knows what they're responsible for.<p class="message sent">Right, that way no one's stepping on each other's toes.<p class=message>Exactly! And it's also important to be respectful of other people's time zones and schedules.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, that's a good point. I imagine that could get tricky sometimes.<p class=message>Definitely, but as long as you keep communication open and clear, it should be manageable.<p class="message sent">Got it. So, have you ever worked on a digital collaborative project before?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It was a website redesign project for a company based in London.<p class="message sent">That's really awesome!<p class=message>It was a great experience. I got to work with people from all over the world and we were able to deliver a great final product.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of fun! Maybe we should try doing something like that sometime.<p class=message>I'm definitely up for it! We can start small and work our way up.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I think that's a great idea. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9cf6068b-b3e4-4d49-813e-29880f4e8372.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
