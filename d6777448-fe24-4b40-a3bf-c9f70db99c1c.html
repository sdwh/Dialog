Do you have a favorite kind?<p class="message sent">I like beef the most, but chicken is also good. What about you?<p class=message>Same here, beef is definitely my favorite. But I've also had lamb Kebab before and it was amazing.<p class="message sent">Oh, I've never tried lamb. I'll have to give it a try sometime.<p class=message>Definitely! And have you ever had Kebab with hummus?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, hummus is the perfect dip for Kebab in my opinion.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. And have you ever had Kebab with tzatziki sauce?<p class="message sent">Yes, and it's delicious too. It just gives it that extra kick.<p class=message>I know right? I also love wrapping my Kebab in pita bread with a bunch of veggies.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, that's the way to go. It just makes it a complete meal.<p class=message>Absolutely. Have you ever made your own Kebab at home?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Have you?<p class=message>Yes! It's actually not that hard. You just need some skewers, meat, and some spices.<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe I'll have to try making my own Kebab sometime.<p class=message>You definitely should.
