How was your experience?<p class=message>It was quite challenging. How long did it take you to finish it?<p class="message sent">It took me two hours. What about you?<p class=message>Same here. Did you find the listening section difficult?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. The recordings were a bit faster than I anticipated.<p class=message>I agree. But how about the reading section?<p class="message sent">That was easier for me. I found the passages interesting to read.<p class=message>Yeah, me too. Did you have any strategies for the grammar section?<p class="message sent">I did. I focused on identifying the incorrect sentences first before looking for the correct ones.<p class=message>Great tip! I'll keep that in mind for the next time I take the exam.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, do you plan on taking it again?<p class=message>Maybe in a few months. How about you?<p class="message sent">I don't think so. I feel like I did my best in this one.<p class=message>That's understandable. But still, it's good to keep practicing our English skills.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Do you have any recommended study materials?<p class=message>I found some helpful resources online, like practice tests and exercises.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tip! I'll check them out. It was nice discussing the exam experience with you.<p class=message>Same here! Let's catch up again soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=df0fdbc1-3858-4fec-9b8a-206c68de80c4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
