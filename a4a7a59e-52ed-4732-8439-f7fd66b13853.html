Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm B, the database administrator. Nice to meet you too.<p class=message>So, we're tasked with creating an app for online booking and check-in for this airline. Do you have any initial thoughts?<p class="message sent">Well, we need to ensure the database can handle a large number of simultaneous bookings and ticket changes.<p class=message>Agreed. And we'll need to make sure the app is user-friendly and easy to navigate.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It should also provide real-time updates on flight schedules and gate changes to ensure a smooth experience for passengers.<p class=message>And don't forget about security. We must ensure personal information and credit card details are well-protected.<p class="message sent">Of course. How about integrating a loyalty program to incentivize people to keep using this app?<p class=message>That's a great idea. It would encourage people to book with this airline more often.<p class="message sent">We can also allow passengers to select seats of their liking while booking. It will make the boarding process smoother too.<p class=message>And how about a chatbot for customer service to answer any questions they might have?<p class="message sent">Yes, that could really enhance the user experience. We'll also need to make sure the app is compatible with various devices.<p class=message>That's definitely important. In the end, we want an application that makes booking and check-in as seamless as possible.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And with our combined expertise, we can make it happen.<p class=message>That's right, we'll make sure it's all systems go. Thanks for your time, B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a498db15-7a36-453f-8b10-bb05a7286052.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
