Please take a seat.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Officer.<p class=message>So, what brings you here today, sir?<p class="message sent">Well, I was just passing by and thought, why not check out the police station?<p class=message>Is that so? It's funny because our records show that you were caught shoplifting yesterday.<p class="message sent">Oh, that. Yes, I did take a couple of candy bars, but I was actually planning to pay for them later.<p class=message>I see. And, what about the security footage of you sticking the candy bars in your pocket and walking out of the store without paying?<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. That. Well, I was just testing the security measures of the store.<p class=message>(chuckles) That's quite a creative defense, sir. But I'm afraid it's not going to help you get out of trouble.<p class="message sent">Fair enough, Officer. But, would it be possible to get a hold of one of those candy bars? I'm quite fond of them.<p class=message>(laughs) I'm afraid not, sir. You'll have to find a different way to satisfy your sweet tooth.<p class="message sent">Well, it was worth a shot. Thanks for the chat, Officer.<p class=message>No problem, sir. I hope you'll think twice before attempting to "test" security measures again.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I've learned my lesson. Have a good day.<p class=message>You too, sir.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f9a1a629-89ca-43ce-9888-8d22aaef8478.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
