You must be B, the server.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. Nice to meet you! Is everything prepped and ready to grill?<p class=message>Definitely! We've got fresh seafood and meat just waiting to sizzle on the grill.<p class="message sent">Great, I can already smell the deliciousness. I'll start taking orders from the customers.<p class=message>Sounds good. Let me know if anyone has any special requests or allergies.<p class="message sent">Will do! Hey, have you tried the new marinade we're using for the steak?<p class=message>Yes, it's amazing! The garlic and herb blend really brings out the flavor.<p class="message sent">I know, right? I love it on the shrimp skewers as well. And don't forget to give the corn on the cob a good char.<p class=message>Of course, can't have a proper beach barbecue without grilled corn. Speaking of which, have you tried our homemade barbecue sauce?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard it's a customer favorite. I'll have to give it a try tonight.<p class=message>Definitely do, it pairs perfectly with the pulled pork sandwiches. And make sure you recommend the fresh catch of the day to the customers.<p class="message sent">Will do. We've got some great options like red snapper and mahi-mahi. I'm sure the customers will love it.<p class=message>I'm sure they will, especially with that view of the ocean. It's the perfect setting for a beach barbecue.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Hey, how about we grill up some pineapple slices for dessert?<p class=message>That's a great idea, and we can serve it with a scoop of coconut ice cream to really give it that tropical vibe.<p class="message sent">You read my mind. This is going to be a great night! Let's get grilling.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a3a66a6c-5cd6-47df-b25b-3714b5764d7d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
