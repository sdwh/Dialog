How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, sir. I'm doing great! Excited for our trip to Perth.<p class=message>Me too! Have you been to Perth before?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, many times. It's a beautiful city with some amazing beaches.<p class=message>That sounds wonderful. I've always wanted to try surfing.<p class="message sent">Well, you're in luck! Perth has some of the best surf spots in the world.<p class=message>Really? That's awesome. Do you surf?<p class="message sent">I used to when I was younger. Haven't done it in a while though.<p class=message>Maybe we can take a lesson together. It could be fun!<p class="message sent">Haha, I'm up for anything. We'll have to see how it goes.<p class=message>So, do you have any recommendations for places to eat in Perth?<p class="message sent">If you're looking for something fancy, try Nobu at Crown Perth. But for something more casual, I recommend Alfred's Kitchen.<p class=message>Thanks for the tips. I'll definitely check them out.<p class="message sent">No problem. Do you have any plans while you're in Perth?<p class=message>A friend recommended visiting the Fremantle Markets, and I also want to see the famous quokkas on Rottnest Island.<p class="message sent">Those are great choices. I'm sure you'll have a blast.<p class=message>I hope so! How much longer until we reach the airport?<p class="message sent">We are about 20 minutes away, sir. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>No, thank you. You've been very helpful. I'm looking forward to our trip to Perth!<p class="message sent">My pleasure, sir. Let's have a great trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=89eb7691-6d1a-4da2-bd35-fc698c51dd09.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
