Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Well, I think an "Introduction to Wine Tasting" could be a fun and educational class.<p class=message>Oh, I like the sound of that. Do you think it would be popular with our students?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, it's a skill that can be applied in many industries and social settings.<p class=message>Great suggestion. And what about our general education requirements? Any changes to suggest there?<p class="message sent">Currently, we only have one course on world religions. I think it would be beneficial to add another course that focuses specifically on Eastern religions.<p class=message>I completely agree. That's been on my mind too. Which religions do you think should be covered in the course?<p class="message sent">Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, and Taoism, to start with.<p class=message>Excellent. I'll make a note of that. Do you have any other suggestions for the schedule?<p class="message sent">How about a course on the history of sports? I think that could be really interesting for our students.<p class=message>Yes, that sounds great. We'll add that to the list. Thank you for your input, Professor B. It's always helpful to have your expertise.<p class="message sent">Anytime, happy to help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=338acdcd-6a52-4ff0-9b72-9ebf6918545b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
