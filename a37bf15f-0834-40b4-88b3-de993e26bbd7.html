How's the sago pudding coming along?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. It's coming along well, just need a bit more time to thicken up.<p class=message>Great to hear. Oh, and I tried your egg tarts. They were fantastic!<p class="message sent">Thank you, A! I'm glad you enjoyed them. Have you tried the mango pudding yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've had my eye on it. How is it?<p class="message sent">It's always a hit with our customers. The fresh mango adds a really nice touch.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. You know, I think our customers appreciate authentic Hong Kong-style desserts like these.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I've been making traditional recipes passed down in my family for years.<p class=message>That's great to hear. And our dim sum is also quite popular, especially the siu mai and har gow.<p class="message sent">Yes, people love its freshness and quality. I take pride in making it from scratch every day.<p class=message>It shows! Do you have any new dessert ideas you want to try out?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of experimenting with some new flavors for our bubble tea. Maybe taro or durian?<p class=message>Interesting. I trust your judgment, let's give it a try.<p class="message sent">Will do, A. Let's keep pushing the limits and making sure our customers leave satisfied.<p class=message>Agreed. That's the goal - offering the best of what Chinatown has to offer.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a37ae951-986a-4fcd-a61b-7266550ac5fb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
