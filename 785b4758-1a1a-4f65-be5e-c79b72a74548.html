Let's start with some basics. Do you know how to choose fresh fish?<p class=message>Yeah, I have some experience, but I'm always open to learning more.<p class="message sent">Ok, well, the first thing to look for is clear eyes. Dull eyes are a sign that the fish is not fresh.<p class=message>That's good to know. What else should I look for?<p class="message sent">Look for fish that have bright, shiny skin and firm flesh. Fish that are slimy or have discolored patches are not fresh.<p class=message>Got it. So, how do you know what fish is in season?<p class="message sent">Usually, it's the fish that are plentiful and have a lower price. In the summer, we have a lot of salmon and in the winter, we have more cod.<p class=message>I see. What is this fish here?<p class="message sent">That's a yellowfin tuna. It's a popular fish for sushi and sashimi.<p class=message>It looks great. How about this one?<p class="message sent">That's a red snapper. It's a tasty fish for grilling or frying.<p class=message>I think I'll get some of those. What's the best way to store it?<p class="message sent">The best way is to keep the fish in the fridge, wrapped in plastic or paper towels to absorb any excess moisture.<p class=message>Thanks for the tip. I can't wait to cook up some fresh fish tonight.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=78588c1a-9e6f-46c3-be90-353a41633121.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
