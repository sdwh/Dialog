Excited to be on set for this movie.<p class=message>That's great to hear! So tell me, how are you feeling about your role in this film?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I'm a bit nervous. This is my first lead role, but I'm up for the challenge!<p class=message>Don't worry, you've got this. I've seen your previous work and you're a natural on camera.<p class="message sent">Aw, thank you! That means a lot coming from a talented producer like you.<p class=message>So, have you had a chance to explore the set yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I actually just came from the costume department. I'm loving the vintage outfits and can't wait to wear them on screen.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. Our costume designer did an amazing job, as always.<p class="message sent">Speaking of outfits, have you seen what the extras are wearing? Their 80s-inspired clothing is hilarious!<p class=message>I know, right? It's perfect for the movie's setting. But we'll have to make sure not to laugh too much on set.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Definitely. So, do you have any fun plans for the weekend after filming?<p class=message>Actually, my wife and I are planning to take a mini vacation. We're going to visit some wineries in Napa Valley.<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing. I'm planning on catching up on some sleep and binge-watching some Netflix.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, that sounds pretty good too. Alright, let's get back to work. We have a movie to make!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=274e9403-8b1c-4a53-b649-f60b18bf5651.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
