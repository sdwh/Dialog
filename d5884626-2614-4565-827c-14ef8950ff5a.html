It's a pretty hefty document.<p class=message>Tell me about it! My eyes glazed over after the first few pages.<p class="message sent">I know what you mean. But I have to say, it's pretty thorough.<p class=message>It better be! We want to make sure our security systems are top-notch.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's a good thing we have this specification to refer to.<p class=message>Absolutely. Hey, did you see the section on access control?<p class="message sent">Yeah, that one caught my eye. It's amazing how much detail they go into.<p class=message>I know, right? Sometimes I wonder if they expect us to be mind-readers.<p class="message sent">Ha! Yeah, it can be a bit overwhelming. But it's reassuring to know that we're not missing anything.<p class=message>True, true. And if we ever need to show our clients that we're meeting ISO 27001 standards, we can just whip out this document.<p class="message sent">Exactly! It's like having a security badge of honor.<p class=message>Oh, speaking of badges, did you catch the section on physical security requirements?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did. It's like they're telling us to put up barbed wire and guard dogs.<p class=message>Hahaha, right? Maybe we should install a moat around the office too, just for good measure.<p class="message sent">Hey, that could work! Who needs security cameras when you have a moat?<p class=message>Now you're thinking like a true security expert!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d5838b4d-61c0-442a-933c-0c440b2f9e57.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
