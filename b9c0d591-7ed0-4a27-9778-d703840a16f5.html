It's nice to have a clean house.<p class=message>Definitely. Do you and your mom split up the chores evenly?<p class="message sent">Well, I do most of the cleaning while my mom takes care of the laundry and cooking.<p class=message>That sounds like a good system. Do you ever get lazy and not feel like cleaning?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, sometimes I just want to lay in bed all day. But my mom always motivates me to get up and get things done.<p class=message>Moms can be pretty good at motivating us. What's your least favorite chore to do?<p class="message sent">Definitely cleaning the bathroom. It's so gross.<p class=message>I agree, but it's also one of the most satisfying things to have clean.<p class="message sent">That's true. What about you, A? Do you like doing housework?<p class=message>Honestly, not really. But I always feel so accomplished when everything is clean and organized.<p class="message sent">I know what you mean. It's nice to have a clean and tidy house.<p class=message>For sure. Do you and your mom have any fun little rituals or rewards when you finish all the chores?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we like to sit down and have some tea or hot cocoa together. It's a nice way to relax and enjoy our hard work.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. Well, I better go and clean my own house now. Thanks for chatting with me, B!<p class="message sent">Of course, have fun cleaning!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b9bf8319-7921-4d6e-94f1-cb194f707253.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
