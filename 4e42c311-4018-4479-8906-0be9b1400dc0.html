I'm actually really excited about it because it's a great framework for web development.<p class=message>Definitely. And I think it'll make our jobs as developers a lot easier with its clean syntax and easy-to-use features.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Plus, the fact that it's built on top of .NET Core means we can take advantage of all the benefits of that platform as well.<p class=message>That's a good point. I've been enjoying working with .NET Core so far. It definitely speeds up the development process.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And with Razor Pages, we can create dynamic web pages with minimal coding. It's really cool.<p class=message>I hear you can even use Razor Pages with Blazor to build fully-featured web applications.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's true. It's amazing how much these frameworks can do. I can't wait to see how our new website turns out.<p class=message>Me too. Do you think we should incorporate any other technologies into the stack?<p class="message sent">Well, we could always consider using a front-end framework like React or Angular to make the user experience even better.<p class=message>That's a good point. I know React is really popular right now. But let's focus on one thing at a time. We still have a lot of work to do with Razor Pages.<p class="message sent">Fair enough. We definitely have our hands full with this project. But I'm looking forward to putting all our skills to use.<p class=message>Same here. And who knows, maybe we'll even learn some new ones along the way.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit! Let's get started then.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e33a68a-f77d-40b4-a0ba-39dbc8fec224.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
