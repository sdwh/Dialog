Have you had a chance to look at the ISO 27001 audit plan that we need to write?<p class="message sent">Hey! I have briefly reviewed it. Do you have any specific ideas on how to go about it?<p class=message>Well, to start off, we need to ensure that we cover all the necessary areas while keeping it light-hearted. Let's make sure that our auditees don't feel intimidated.<p class="message sent">I agree. I think we should add some quirky statements here and there to lighten the mood. Maybe some funny memes on information security?<p class=message>Haha, that sounds like a great idea. Also, we should remind the auditees that we are there to help, not judge.<p class="message sent">Definitely. How about using some illustrations to make the plan visually appealing and easy to read? Maybe a cartoon character depicting different stages of the audit?<p class=message>Yes! That would definitely add an element of fun to the otherwise mundane ISO document.<p class="message sent">Speaking of fun, how about adding a section titled "ISO trivia" with some interesting facts and figures?<p class=message>Brilliant! That will keep the auditees engaged and also educate them.<p class="message sent">I also think we need to keep the language simple and avoid technical jargon as much as possible. We don't want to confuse the auditees.<p class=message>Agreed. We should ensure that the plan is user-friendly and easy to comprehend.<p class="message sent">And finally, we need to make sure that it aligns with the company's culture. We don't want the auditees to feel like it's a generic document.<p class=message>Spot on. Let's sprinkle some company-specific information, like their mission statement or values, to personalize it.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! With all these elements, I think we can make the ISO 27001 audit plan not just informative, but also entertaining.<p class=message>Absolutely, let's get started on it and make it a masterpiece!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e18ef7a-b5a3-4678-8baf-da834833822a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
