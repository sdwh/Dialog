Our goal is to make it easy for customers to find what they're looking for. We typically organize products by category and place the most popular ones at eye level.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I've also noticed that you have impulse items like candy near the checkout. Is that intentional?<p class=message>Absolutely! We try to grab customers' attention with those items while they're waiting in line.<p class="message sent">Interesting. What about seasonal items? How do you decide where to place them in the store?<p class=message>Well, we typically have a designated area for seasonal items, and we try to locate it near the entrance to the store to grab customers' attention.<p class="message sent">Do you use any special sales tactics, like having a sale section?<p class=message>Yes, we have a designated area for clearance merchandise. We put it in the back of the store to encourage customers to browse other products before they get there.<p class="message sent">That's smart, I can see how that would increase sales. Do you change the displays regularly?<p class=message>Yes, we try to change things up every few weeks to keep the displays fresh and interesting. It's also a good way to showcase new products.<p class="message sent">I've noticed that you have a lot of signage throughout the store. Is it effective?<p class=message>It is! Our signage is designed to help customers find what they need quickly and easily.<p class="message sent">It sounds like you have a well-thought-out strategy in place. Thanks for your time.<p class=message>No problem, always happy to help. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ad9d49f5-5827-49ff-970e-bab6359b3378.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
