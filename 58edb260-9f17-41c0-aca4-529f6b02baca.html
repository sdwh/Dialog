Welcome aboard this sightseeing tour bus. My name is Jack and I'll be your driver and guide today. Is everyone all set?<p class="message sent">Yes, we're excited!<p class=message>Great to hear that! So, where are y'all from?<p class="message sent">We're from Australia. How about you?<p class=message>I'm from here, in LA! I love this city and I'm sure you guys will too.<p class="message sent">That's great. Can you tell us something interesting about LA?<p class=message>Of course! Did you know that the Hollywood sign was originally an advertisement for a real estate development?<p class="message sent">Really? That's so cool. What else can we see on this tour?<p class=message>Well, we'll be cruising through Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive, and Sunset Strip. And we'll stop at the world-famous Farmers Market and The Grove for a quick shopping break.<p class="message sent">That all sounds amazing. What's your favorite part of the tour?<p class=message>I absolutely love the Griffith Observatory. You can see stunning views of the city and explore the planets and stars through telescopes there.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like a must-visit spot. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class=message>No problem! And don't forget to take lots of pictures along the way. LA is such a photogenic city.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Thanks for being such a great guide, Jack.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your stay in LA and don't forget to catch a Lakers or Clippers game while you're here. They're two of the best basketball teams in the country.<p class="message sent">Will do! Thanks again. You're the best!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=58ec9842-0157-4426-acda-c27b2765f25a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
