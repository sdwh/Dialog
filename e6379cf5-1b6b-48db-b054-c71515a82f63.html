Are you ready for the surgery today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Doctor A! I'm excited as always. But I hope it's not going to be too complicated.<p class=message>Don't worry. We make a great team, and everything will go smoothly as long as we keep our focus.<p class="message sent">Yes, I completely agree with you. By the way, have you heard the latest joke from Dr. C?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's the joke about?<p class="message sent">It's about a guy who went to the doctor and said, "Doc, I can't stop singing 'What's New Pussycat?' " and the doctor said, "That sounds like Tom Jones syndrome."<p class=message>*laughs* That's hilarious! Dr. C never fails to make us laugh.<p class="message sent">I know, right? But let's not forget that we have a serious job to do. Let's get this surgery started.<p class=message>Absolutely, let's get to work. And remember, if you need anything during the procedure, don't hesitate to let me know.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Doctor A. I have everything under control, but it's always nice to have your support.<p class=message>That's what teamwork is all about.
