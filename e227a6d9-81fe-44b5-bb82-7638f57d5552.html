I'm heading there for vacation soon.<p class="message sent">Of course! Cairns has some amazing dishes that you have to try. Have you heard of the Cairns Mud Crab?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's that?<p class="message sent">It's exactly what it sounds like, a type of crab found in the muddy waters surrounding Cairns. It's cooked in all sorts of ways - stir-fried, steamed, and even served with pasta.<p class=message>That sounds really unique. Any other dishes I should try while I'm there?<p class="message sent">Definitely try the Australian meat pies. They're a staple food in the country and there are plenty of varieties to choose from in Cairns.<p class=message>I've heard about that before, but I've never had it. What's in it?<p class="message sent">It's a pastry filled with meat and gravy. You can add vegetables or cheese to it too.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds delicious. Is there anything to try for dessert?<p class="message sent">You have to try the Tim Tam Slam. It's a chocolate biscuit that you dip into a hot beverage, like tea or coffee, and then eat. It's messy, but so worth it.<p class=message>I can't wait to try all of these dishes! Is there anything you don't like?<p class="message sent">Well, there's Vegemite. It's a spread that Australians love, but it's an acquired taste. I can't stand it personally.<p class=message>Good to know, I'll make sure to avoid that one. Any other recommendations for my trip to Cairns?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Take a scenic railway ride through the rainforest or go on a snorkeling tour at the Great Barrier Reef. And don't forget to take a dip in the crystal-clear waters of Mossman Gorge!<p class=message>Wow, there's so much to do there. Thanks for all the tips!<p class="message sent">Of course, have an amazing trip and enjoy all the amazing food Cairns has to offer!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e2220923-bc83-4d18-8573-c34ca85ecf48.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
