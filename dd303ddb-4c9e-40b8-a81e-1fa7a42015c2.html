It's such a beautiful day out.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, dad. I'm always up for some fresh air and exercise.<p class=message>So, what's new with you? How's school going?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thanks for asking. I just finished a project on the solar system.<p class=message>That's awesome, what did you learn?<p class="message sent">I learned about the different planets and their moons. Did you know that Jupiter has the most moons out of any planet in our solar system?<p class=message>Wow, I didn't know that. You really do learn something new every day.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's pretty cool. What about you, dad? What have you been up to lately?<p class=message>Nothing too exciting, just work and some gardening in the backyard. I'm trying to grow some vegetables.<p class="message sent">That's great, maybe we can make a salad with them one day.<p class=message>Good idea, son. Say, do you want to race to that tree over there?<p class="message sent">You're on, dad! Ready, set, go!<p class=message>*laughs* You're getting faster every day, son. I think I'm going to have to start training to keep up with you.<p class="message sent">Yeah, maybe we can start running together every morning.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Hey, let's go grab some ice cream before we head home.<p class="message sent">Yes! I'm always down for some ice cream.<p class=message>Okay, but no topping this time. You had enough sugar for the day.<p class="message sent">*laughs* Okay, dad. Just plain vanilla for me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dd2ca2ec-2199-4417-b217-e440611389ea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
