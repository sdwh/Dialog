How was your trip to the fish market today?<p class="message sent">It was great! I managed to get some really fresh fish and seafood for the restaurant.<p class=message>Fantastic! That's exactly what we need to keep our customers happy. What did you manage to find?<p class="message sent">I got some really nice snapper and tuna, and some clams, oysters and crabs as well.<p class=message>Sounds great! I was thinking we could make a seafood paella for our specials this week. Do you think the fish and seafood you got would be suitable for that?<p class="message sent">Definitely. The snapper and tuna are perfect for the paella, and the clams, oysters and crabs can be used to add some more flavour and texture to the dish.<p class=message>Perfect! I can't wait to try it. Do you need any help preparing the fish and seafood?<p class="message sent">Actually, that would be great. I could do with an extra pair of hands.<p class=message>Sure, I'd be happy to help. What do you need me to do?<p class="message sent">Can you help me clean and fillet the snapper and tuna? And maybe help with shucking some of the oysters too?<p class=message>No problem at all. I'm actually pretty good at filleting fish, if I do say so myself!<p class="message sent">Great, then you can teach me a thing or two! Let's get started.<p class=message>Agreed. But first, let's have a cup of coffee to fuel up for the task ahead!<p class="message sent">Definitely. I could use a shot of caffeine right about now.<p class=message>It's always good to take a break and recharge. Let's enjoy our coffee and then get back to work.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Thanks for your help, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B. That's what partners are for!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4ff5573f-7fd9-491f-b594-baab73e7aa15.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
