How's everything going today?<p class="message sent">Hi A! Everything's good, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good as well. Just here to discuss some adjustments for one of my patients' medication plan.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! What's the patient's condition and current treatment?<p class=message>The patient has hypertension and is currently taking lisinopril. However, their blood pressure still runs high consistently.<p class="message sent">Alright, we may need to increase the dosage or switch to another medication. Have you tried lifestyle changes as well?<p class=message>Yes, I've been advising the patient to cut back on sodium and increase physical activity.<p class="message sent">Great, that's definitely helpful. I can suggest some diuretics or calcium channel blockers as alternative medications too.<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestion. I think I'll start with increasing the dosage of lisinopril and see how that works out.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. We'll make an adjustment accordingly if necessary. Anything else you need help with?<p class=message>Actually, on another note, I have a new patient who is allergic to penicillin. What other antibiotics would you recommend?<p class="message sent">We have a few options such as erythromycin, clindamycin, and azithromycin. It would depend on the patient's other medical history and any other medications they are currently on.<p class=message>I see. Thanks for the input, B. You're always a great help.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, A. That's what I'm here for.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b2977225-122a-4653-9a53-f95d4e9c93f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
