It looks really good.<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! I think it's pretty tasty, but I've had better.<p class=message>Oh really? What didn't you like about it?<p class="message sent">Well, for one, I think the breading could have been a little less greasy. And also, I found the fish to be a little overcooked.<p class=message>Hmm, interesting. I actually really enjoyed it! I thought the breading was nice and crunchy, and the fish was perfectly cooked.<p class="message sent">Well, we can agree to disagree on that one! But overall, I still think it's a solid dish.<p class=message>Yeah, I would have to agree. It's definitely not the best fish fillet I've ever had, but it's still pretty good.<p class="message sent">I think that's a fair assessment. Have you tried their tartar sauce? It's really delicious.<p class=message>Oh, no I haven't. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem! I always like trying different sauces with my fish. It really brings out the flavors.<p class=message>That's a good idea! I might have to give that a try next time.<p class="message sent">Definitely do! And if you find any other great sauces, let me know. I'm always looking to mix things up.<p class=message>For sure! It's always fun to experiment with new flavors. Thanks again for the suggestion.<p class="message sent">Of course, anytime. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4b023528-d012-43b5-a501-55e46bac4beb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
