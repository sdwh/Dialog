What do you have for us today?<p class=message>Just picked up some fresh hot dim sum from the steamers. Smells amazing.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love dim sum! That's the best part of working at a restaurant, free food deliveries.<p class=message>Well, I certainly don't mind the occasional free meal when dropping off orders.<p class="message sent">You know, I always thought it would be cool to be a delivery driver. Driving around all day, listening to music or audiobooks.<p class=message>It definitely has its perks, but trust me, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Traffic can be a nightmare, and some customers are not exactly pleasant.<p class="message sent">That's true, dealing with grumpy customers is never fun. But serving them delicious food usually cheers them up.<p class=message>Haha, yeah, food always makes people happy. Speaking of which, can we sample some of that dim sum before we bring it to the kitchen?<p class="message sent">I don't see why not. Let's dig in!<p class=message>Wow, these shu mais are so juicy, they practically burst in my mouth.<p class="message sent">And the har gow is perfectly steamed, not too sticky or soggy.<p class=message>I know, I could eat this all day. It almost makes me want to work at a restaurant instead of driving a truck.<p class="message sent">Hey, we're always looking for talented chefs to join our team. You never know, you might just find your true calling.<p class=message>Ha, who knows, maybe I'm a closeted master chef. Although, I think I'll stick to what I know best for now.<p class="message sent">Fair enough. Well, thanks for the delicious delivery and for sharing the dim sum with me. Until next time!<p class=message>Anytime, take care and enjoy the rest of your shift.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8c83025f-0b44-4dbb-9cd4-5382fc9a9925.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
