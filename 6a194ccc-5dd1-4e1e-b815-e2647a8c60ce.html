I'm bummed that I lost some time on the track today.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. That's what I'm here for. What's going on with the car?<p class=message>It's not accelerating like it should. I think it might be a problem with the fuel injection system.<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me take a look. You know, I used to race cars when I was younger. I was pretty good at it, too.<p class=message>Really? I had no idea. What made you switch to being a mechanic?<p class="message sent">Well, after a while, I realized that I enjoyed working on the cars more than driving them. Plus, my wife was tired of me coming home with broken bones.<p class=message>Fair enough. So, do you miss racing at all?<p class="message sent">Sometimes, but I get my thrills vicariously through working on your car.<p class=message>Ha, well I hope I can give you some excitement soon. Any progress on the repairs?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it looks like the fuel injectors were clogged. I cleaned them out, and the car should be running like a dream now.<p class=message>Awesome, thanks so much. You really know your stuff.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. Just remember to keep up with regular maintenance, so we don't have any surprises on race day.<p class=message>Right, I'll make sure to do that. Hey, have you ever thought about getting back into racing?<p class="message sent">Not really. I may be getting on in years, but I can still hear the engines roar in my dreams.<p class=message>Well, I'm glad you're on my team, B. Let's show the competition what we're made of.<p class="message sent">You got it, A. Now let's get that car out there and win this race!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6a180a6f-af0b-4028-be80-823d559bb9fd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
