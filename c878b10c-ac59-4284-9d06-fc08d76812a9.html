Have you watched it?"<p class=message>"No, I haven't. What's it about?"<p class="message sent">"It's a South Korean movie about a lower-class family who scams their way into working for a wealthy family. The movie explores themes of social class and inequality."<p class=message>"Wow, that sounds really interesting. What did you think about it?"<p class="message sent">"I thought it was amazing. The storytelling was very original and engaging, and the acting was top-notch."<p class=message>"I've heard a lot of good things about it. Maybe I'll give it a watch this weekend."<p class="message sent">"Definitely do. I think you'll enjoy it. What other movies have you watched recently?"<p class=message>"I just watched the new 'Joker' movie. It was intense!"<p class="message sent">"Oh, I've been wanting to see that. What did you think?"<p class=message>"It was really well-done. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was incredible. I felt like I was on the edge of my seat the whole time."<p class="message sent">"I've heard it's quite dark. Did you find it disturbing?"<p class=message>"Yeah, it definitely had some disturbing moments, but overall, I thought it was a powerful commentary on society and mental illness."<p class="message sent">"Sounds like a movie that really makes you think. I'll have to check it out."<p class=message>"Yeah, it's definitely worth a watch. Have you seen any other movies that you would recommend?"<p class="message sent">"Yeah, I recently watched 'Knives Out'. It's a whodunit mystery film with a star-studded cast. Daniel Craig is hilarious in it."<p class=message>"I've heard about that one too. I'm a fan of murder mysteries. How was the plot?"<p class="message sent">"Without giving too much away, the plot was very clever and kept me guessing until the end. It was definitely one of the best movies I've seen recently."<p class=message>"Awesome, I'll have to add it to my watchlist. Thanks for the recommendation."<p class="message sent">"No problem. Let me know what you think after you watch it."</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c8783248-16bd-459a-9802-8aa2b8489b4a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
