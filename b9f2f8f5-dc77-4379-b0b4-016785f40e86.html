I'm feeling lucky today. Can I join in on the craps game?<p class="message sent">Of course, you can! Welcome to our table. Do you know how to play?<p class=message>Yes, I've played before. But could you refresh my memory a bit?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. It's a simple game where you roll the dice and bet on the outcome.<p class=message>I remember now.
