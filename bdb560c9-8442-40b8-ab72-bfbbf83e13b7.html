Maybe a playing card or some chips?<p class=message>Yeah, grab a few chips and play around with them. Maybe toss them in the air and catch them.<p class="message sent">Okay, let me give it a try. *starts playing with the chips*<p class=message>Nice, nice. Keep it going.

Thank you for making this shoot enjoyable.<p class=message>No problem at all. It's always great when the model is enthusiastic and creative.
