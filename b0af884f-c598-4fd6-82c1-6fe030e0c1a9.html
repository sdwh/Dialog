What's Pho?<p class=message>Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup, usually served with beef or chicken and a lot of fresh herbs. It's so delicious, especially when you're craving something hot and savory.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that sounds interesting. What's your favorite Pho place?<p class=message>There's this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant downtown that serves the best Pho, in my opinion. The broth is so rich and flavorful, and the noodles are always perfectly cooked.<p class="message sent">Oh, wow. I'm definitely going to have to try that out sometime. Do you have any tips for ordering Pho?<p class=message>My trick is to add a little bit of lime juice and hot sauce to give it some zing. And don't be afraid to slurp up those noodles - that's how you know you're really enjoying your Pho.<p class="message sent">Haha, okay, I'll have to remember that. What about vegetarian options?<p class=message>Actually, I've seen some restaurants that offer a vegan or vegetarian version of Pho. I haven't tried it myself, but I've heard it's just as tasty.<p class="message sent">Awesome, thanks for letting me know. I'm definitely going to have to try Pho soon.<p class=message>You won't regret it! It's the perfect comfort food on a cold day, but I also love eating it during the summer because it's so fresh and flavorful.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b0a7fd07-3d87-44e2-b229-9afc4af8f17d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
