Have you tried the bumper cars yet?<p class="message sent">Hey, not yet. How was it?<p class=message>It was so much fun! I felt like a kid again.<p class="message sent">Sounds exciting! Is it safe?<p class=message>Yeah, it's pretty safe. The cars are surrounded by a rubber barrier, so it's not dangerous.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. How fast do the cars go?<p class=message>They go pretty fast, but not too fast that it's out of control. You can still bump into other cars without getting hurt.<p class="message sent">I like the sound of that. How long do we get to ride the cars?<p class=message>You get to ride for about 5 minutes, but you can always get back in line and ride again.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a good amount of time. Do you need to wear any safety gear, like a helmet?<p class=message>No, you don't need a helmet. But I suggest wearing comfortable clothes and shoes.<p class="message sent">Alright, got it. I'm excited to try it out now. Do we need to pay extra?<p class=message>Yeah, it's an additional fee, but it's definitely worth it.<p class="message sent">Great, let's do it! Thanks for the recommendation.<p class=message>No problem. Let's go have some fun and bump into each other!<p class="message sent">Let's do it! I'll meet you at the bumper cars.<p class=message>See you there!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=662fefc7-28d8-4941-817c-1f5de9042dd9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
