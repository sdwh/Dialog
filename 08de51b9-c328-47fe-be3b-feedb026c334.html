I heard you're a game developer.<p class="message sent message-content">Yup, that's right. I'm currently working on a sci-fi game.<p class="message received message-content">Awesome! I love sci-fi games. Can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent message-content">It's set in a future where humanity has colonized multiple planets and you play as a space explorer trying to uncover a secret conspiracy.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds intriguing. What kind of gameplay features will it have?<p class="message sent message-content">We're still working out the details, but we're considering adding some advanced techno-gadgets to help players navigate and interact with the environment.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds great! Do you need any help playtesting the game?<p class="message sent message-content">Actually, yes we do! We're always looking for feedback. Would you be interested in testing it out?<p class="message received message-content">Definitely! I'll be happy to try it out and provide feedback.<p class="message sent message-content">Great! I'll send you the beta version once it's ready.<p class="message received message-content">Thanks! Oh, and one more thing. Will there be any space battles?<p class="message sent message-content">Of course! What sci-fi game would be complete without epic space battles?<p class="message received message-content">Yes! I can't wait to try it out. It sounds like an awesome game.<p class="message sent message-content">Thanks! We're putting a lot of effort into it and we hope players enjoy it as much as we do.<p class="message received message-content">I'm sure they will. Keep up the great work!<p class="message sent message-content">Thanks, will do!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=08da3b14-59a1-4319-912a-1f1f3d933520.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
