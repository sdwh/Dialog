May I help you with the menu?<p class="message sent">Yes please, what do you recommend for tonight?<p class=message>Our special dish for tonight is the grilled lobster with garlic butter sauce. It's one of our customer's favourites.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious, I'll have that please.<p class=message>Great choice! Would you like any sides with that, perhaps some roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes?<p class="message sent">I think I'll go with some roasted vegetables, thank you.<p class=message>Excellent choice. And to start, may I suggest our prawn cocktail or our cauliflower soup?<p class="message sent">I think I'll try the prawn cocktail.<p class=message>Wonderful, I'll place your order and it should be with you shortly. Can I get you anything to drink while you wait?<p class="message sent">Yes please, I'll have a glass of your house red wine.<p class=message>Absolutely, coming right up.<p class="message sent">This lobster really is amazing, I've never tasted anything like it.<p class=message>I'm so glad you enjoyed it! Our chef takes great pride in his creations.<p class="message sent">I can tell! It's just incredible. Do you think you could ask the chef for the recipe?<p class=message>Oh, I'm afraid that's a well-kept secret. But I'll be sure to pass on your compliments to him.<p class="message sent">Please do! And thank you so much for recommending it.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. May I interest you in some dessert, perhaps our homemade tiramisu or our chocolate lava cake?<p class="message sent">I don't think I could eat another bite! But thank you for the recommendation.<p class=message>Of course, take your time. And when you're ready, I'll bring you the bill.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I'll definitely be back again. This was an incredible dining experience.<p class=message>We look forward to seeing you again soon. Thank you for dining with us!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3ad4e04c-be90-4278-8e33-27a88933fa95.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
