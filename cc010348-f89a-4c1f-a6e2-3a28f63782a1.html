Thanks for meeting with me to go over my manuscript.<p class="message sent">No problem A, I'm excited to read it. What genre is it?<p class=message>It's a young adult fantasy novel. I know it's been done before, but I think my story brings something new to the table.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Let's start by going over the first chapter. I noticed a couple of spelling mistakes, but overall it's a strong start.<p class=message>Ah, embarrassing! Thanks for catching those. Is there anything in particular that stood out to you?<p class="message sent">I really enjoyed the world-building you did. The descriptions of the magical creatures and their habitats were very vivid and imaginative.<p class=message>That means a lot coming from you. I was worried it might come off as too cheesy.<p class="message sent">Not at all. In fact, I think you could lean into the whimsical tone even more. Young adult readers love being transported to other worlds.<p class=message>You're right, I'll keep that in mind during revisions. Speaking of, what's your timeline for getting the final draft?<p class="message sent">Ideally, I'd like it in two months. But let's set a soft deadline for three, just in case.<p class=message>Three months, got it. I'll get back to work on it ASAP.<p class="message sent">Great, and don't forget to take breaks and take care of yourself along the way. Writing a book can be stressful.<p class=message>Thanks for the reminder, B. Maybe I'll treat myself to a massage after hitting a big milestone.<p class="message sent">Now that sounds like a plan! Keep me updated on your progress, A. I can't wait to read more.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cbffe7e6-9e19-42d0-97cf-0cffda5037a7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
