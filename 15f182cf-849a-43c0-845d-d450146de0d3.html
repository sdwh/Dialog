Can you recommend some tips for using the different types of utensils when dining out?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's start with the napkin. It should be placed on your lap as soon as you sit down.<p class=message>Okay, got it. And what about the different types of glasses?<p class="message sent">The tall and slim ones are typically used for water, while the wider ones are for red wine, and the thinner ones are for white wine.<p class=message>Interesting! How about the plates and bowls?<p class="message sent">Generally, the smaller plates are for bread or appetizers, while the larger ones are for the main course. And bowls are typically used for soup or cereal.<p class=message>That makes sense. And what about the utensils?<p class="message sent">The fork is on the left side of the plate, while the knife and spoon are on the right. You should use the knife to cut your food, and then switch to the fork to eat.<p class=message>Sounds easy enough. And what about cups?<p class="message sent">Cups are typically used for hot beverages like tea or coffee. And don't forget, never grab the cup with your fingers on the rim!<p class=message>Good to know. Is there anything else I need to keep in mind?<p class="message sent">Just remember to always use utensils, even for finger foods. And when you're finished, place them neatly on the plate, with the handles facing to the right.<p class=message>Great tips, thanks so much for your help!<p class="message sent">Of course! It's important to know the proper etiquette when dining out. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=15ecf3a4-ef2d-4a3c-a40e-436d565ab512.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
