It's another beautiful day in the old town, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! I'm always excited to start my day here selling my delicious sticky rice cakes.<p class=message>And I'm excited to brew and sell my tea products here! Speaking of which, have you tried the new jasmine green tea that I just imported from Thailand?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't yet. But I'm sure it would pair perfectly with my sweet and savory sticky rice cakes.<p class=message>You're absolutely right! How about we do a collaboration then? I can offer a promotion where customers can get a free cup of jasmine green tea with a purchase of your rice cakes.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a fantastic idea! I'm sure we'll be able to attract a lot of customers with that.<p class=message>And maybe we can come up with a catchy name for our joint promotion. How about "Sticky and Tea"?<p class="message sent">Ha! I love it! Let's print up some flyers and get started on our delicious partnership.<p class=message>Fantastic! Oh, and by the way, have you tried the oolong tea I've been raving about lately? It's a must-try.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But I trust your taste in teas. Maybe we can swap a cup of tea for a sticky rice cake later?<p class=message>You got it! It's always nice to collaborate with someone who shares a passion for great food and drinks.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Here's to a successful partnership and a happy belly!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b44fd5f7-9a06-49e7-b9bc-160b65b6aa33.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
