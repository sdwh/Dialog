So, what's the plan for developing our smart home system?<p class="message sent">Well, we need to start by defining the core features. I think we should have a voice assistant, remote control, and motion sensors.<p class=message>That's a good start. We could also add features like temperature control, lighting control, and security cameras.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we should make sure that all the devices can communicate with each other using a single protocol.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we have to make sure that the system is user-friendly too. We can't have people calling in with questions all the time.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We should make everything as intuitive as possible. What about integrating with other IoT devices?<p class=message>That's a great idea! We could integrate with fitness trackers, music systems, and even smart kitchen appliances.<p class="message sent">Wow, that would be amazing! It sounds like we have a lot of work to do, but I'm excited to get started.<p class=message>Me too. Hey, have you heard about that new smart pillow? It monitors your sleep and adjusts your bed's firmness during the night!<p class="message sent">No way! That's incredible. Maybe we could add that to our system in the future.<p class=message>Definitely. I think our customers would love it. Hey, let's take a quick break and grab some coffee.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I'm always up for a good cup of coffee.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed115806-673c-46da-88d3-cb70910a6279.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
