But on the brighter side, did you see the new electric car Tesla just released?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I saw the pictures, it looks pretty futuristic and cool.<p class=message>Definitely. Speaking of futuristic, have you seen the new iPhone with three cameras?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's crazy how technology is advancing so quickly.<p class=message>It really is. Did you also hear about the new movie that's coming out? It's based on a true story.<p class="message sent">Oh, which one?<p class=message>It's called "Just Mercy" and it's about a lawyer fighting for justice for a wrongly accused man.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting, I'll have to check it out.<p class=message>For sure. Did you catch the season premiere of "The Bachelor" last night?<p class="message sent">No, I missed it. I'm not really into reality TV.<p class=message>That's okay, but you're missing out on all the drama and excitement.<p class="message sent">Haha, I'll take your word for it. So, anything else interesting going on in the world?<p class=message>Well, there was a recent discovery of a new planet in a nearby galaxy.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's pretty cool. Will humans ever be able to travel there?<p class=message>Who knows? Maybe in the future with advanced technology and space exploration.<p class="message sent">That would be pretty amazing.
