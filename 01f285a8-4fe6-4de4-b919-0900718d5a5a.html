Do you have any preferences for the type of room we want?<p class="message received message-content">Not really, as long as it’s relatively affordable and comfortable.<p class="message sent message-content">Okay, I found a few options that fit that description. Do you want to see some pictures of the rooms?<p class="message received message-content">Sure, send them over. Wow, these rooms are pretty nice!<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, but there's a bit of a catch. The cheaper rooms have shared bathrooms.<p class="message received message-content">Hmm, I’m not sure if I’m comfortable with that. Maybe we should spend a bit more for a private bathroom.<p class="message sent message-content">I totally understand. The shared bathrooms do seem a bit sketchy. But the good news is, there's a room with a private bathroom that’s still in our budget.<p class="message received message-content">That’s great news! But what about the location? Is it close to where we’ll be spending most of our time?<p class="message sent message-content">I’ve looked it up, and it’s actually only a 10-minute walk from the main attractions.<p class="message received message-content">Perfect, that sounds like a great option to me. Shall we book it now?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, let’s do it. Do you prefer paying now or when we get there?<p class="message received message-content">I think it’s better to pay now, so we don’t have to worry about it later.<p class="message sent message-content">Agreed. Let me just confirm the dates and details, and then we can complete the booking.<p class="message sent message-content">All done! Our room is confirmed for next week.<p class="message received message-content">Great, I’m getting pretty excited for this trip! Do you want to check out any restaurants nearby tonight?<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds like a plan! Shall we grab some food and celebrate our successful booking?<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely, let’s hope the food is as good as our hotel room!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=01ec6bd8-7977-484e-81e2-ab2cf86e6947.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
