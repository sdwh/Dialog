Can you help me out?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'm happy to help. What kind of car are they interested in?<p class=message>They are thinking of something comfortable and easy to drive but also with enough space for luggage, any suggestions?<p class="message sent">I would recommend a mid-size SUV, like a Kia Sportage or Hyundai Tucson. They are spacious, reliable and comfortable to drive.<p class=message>Great, that sounds perfect for them. And do you have any travel tips for them? They want to explore the city and its surroundings.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Melbourne has so much to offer. They could start by visiting the Queen Victoria Market, then take a drive down the Great Ocean Road to see the Twelve Apostles.<p class=message>That sounds like an amazing trip! Are there any other places you would recommend?<p class="message sent">Yes, they could also visit Yarra Valley for some wine tasting and Balloon flights, and Phillip Island to see the famous penguin parade.<p class=message>Wow, those are all great suggestions, thank you! And do you offer any additional services like GPS or car seats?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have GPS available for an extra fee, and we also provide car seats free of charge for children under 7 years old.<p class=message>Perfect, I'll let my clients know about that. Thank you for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, happy to assist. Have a good day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=49d80162-2868-44a0-a112-8fd398446377.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
