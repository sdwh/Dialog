Here are the hot steamer baskets you ordered from the restaurant.<p class=message>Oh no, I made sure to keep them warm the whole way here. I wouldn't want to disappoint any hungry customers!<p class=message>Well, I have a special insulated bag that keeps the heat in. Plus, I always make sure to deliver the food as quickly as possible to avoid any cooling off.<p class=message>Aw, thank you! I take pride in my work. It's always nice to hear when someone appreciates the effort.<p class=message>I'd love that! These smell amazing. I haven't had breakfast yet, so this is perfect.<p class=message>(also laughs) Well, now we can finally indulge. Which one should I try first?<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Mmm, these are so tasty! You guys really know how to make some great food.<p class=message>That's for sure. So, what is it like working at a restaurant? I've always been curious.<p class=message>That sounds really fun. I'm glad to be a part of the process, even if it's just delivering the meals.<p class=message>You're making me blush! But seriously, it's my pleasure. There's nothing more satisfying than making someone's day with a hot meal.<p class=message>(smiling) It's all in a day's work. Now, let's finish up so I can get back on the road. These dumplings are too good to waste!<p class=message>I'd love that. Thanks for the invite! So long for now, and happy serving.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a9fb9b58-8fbb-4b87-bf37-9bb0873eefb8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
