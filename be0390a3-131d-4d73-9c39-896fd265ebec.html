How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! I'm doing great. Just finished loading up the trailer with some of your finest cattle.<p class=message>Awesome! Glad to hear it. Where are you headed with them?<p class="message sent">Oh, just a few hours away to the big city. Should be a pretty easy trip.<p class=message>That's great. I hope you remember to drive carefully so we don't lose any cows on the way.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, A. I've been doing this for years. I'm like a pro at driving with livestock.<p class=message>Ha! Well, I'm sure those cows appreciate being in such experienced hands.<p class="message sent">You know it! And speaking of those cows, they're some of the biggest and healthiest I've seen in a long time. You've really got a great operation going here.<p class=message>Thanks, B. We take great pride in our livestock. We want our customers to have the best meat they can possibly get.<p class="message sent">And trust me, they do! Every time I make a delivery, I have people asking me where they can get more of your beef.<p class=message>Wow, that's great to hear! Maybe we should start thinking about expanding our operation.<p class="message sent">Hey, I'm all for it! But maybe wait until I retire before you start adding too many more cows to my route.<p class=message>(laughs) Don't worry, B. We'll keep you on as our top driver as long as you're willing to keep hauling our cattle.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me! Now, let's get these bovines on the road so we can get them to their new homes.<p class=message>Agreed! Safe travels, B.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. See you next time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bdffd696-15ae-431e-97c6-98fa487cb1ce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
