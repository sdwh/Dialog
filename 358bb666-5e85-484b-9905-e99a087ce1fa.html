It's great to meet you, B. You're the potter, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. I love working with clay and making unique pieces for people to enjoy.<p class=message>And I love creating delicious desserts for people to indulge in. I think our collaboration is going to be fantastic.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Your desserts look amazing! I especially love the chocolate cake. Do you have any secret recipe to share?<p class=message>I do have a secret ingredient that makes it extra special, but I can't reveal it just yet. Maybe after we've worked together for a while, I'll let you in on the secret.<p class="message sent">Fair enough. I'm excited to see how we can combine my pottery with your desserts.<p class=message>Me too. I'm thinking of creating some mini cakes that we can serve on your beautiful plates.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. And perhaps we can make some matching cups to serve coffee or tea with our desserts.<p class=message>Yes, I love that idea. We can offer a complete sensory experience for our customers.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And maybe we can get some inspiration from the local scenery here in Gifu. I heard this area is famous for its ceramics.<p class=message>That's true. We can incorporate some traditional Japanese designs into our creations.<p class="message sent">Yes, and then we can share our finished products on social media and attract even more visitors to our cafe.<p class=message>Great idea. I can't wait to get started.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's going to be a lot of fun!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3581067a-3704-487d-95fa-17c60d4ed5da.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
