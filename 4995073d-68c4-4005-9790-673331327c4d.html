Welcome to our school.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Mr. Farmer! It's a pleasure to be here. It's such a beautiful day, isn't it?<p class=message>Yes, indeed! We're lucky to have clear skies today. So, how can I help you with the education activities?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm here to talk to the students about agriculture and how important it is for their country.<p class=message>That's a great topic! I'm sure the students will find it interesting.<p class="message sent">I hope so. Do you have any farms nearby that we can visit?<p class=message>Definitely! We can show them our organic vegetable farm or our livestock farm, depending on what you want to focus on.<p class="message sent">Let's go with the organic vegetable farm first then. Can you tell me a bit about it?<p class=message>Sure! We grow a variety of vegetables using only organic fertilizers and no harmful chemicals. We also use some traditional techniques that have been passed down for generations.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! I can't wait to see it myself.<p class=message>It's always good to get your hands dirty in the farm. The students can even help us pick some veggies if they want to.<p class="message sent">That's a brilliant idea! I'm sure they'll love it.<p class=message>It's always great to see young minds take an interest in agriculture. It's the future of our country.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! They need to know where their food comes from and how much hard work it takes to grow it.<p class=message>That's right. And who knows, maybe some of them will become farmers like us when they grow up.<p class="message sent">That would be wonderful! We need more people who appreciate the land and are willing to work hard to provide food for others.<p class=message>Well said. Let's go and inspire some future farmers, shall we?<p class="message sent">Yes! Let's go and have some fun in the farm.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4993be41-ef9a-4b66-a4d1-e6d507193e4b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
