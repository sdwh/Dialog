I heard there were some interesting findings from the recent pen test.<p class="message sent">Hey A! Yeah, we found a few vulnerabilities in the database. Nothing too serious but definitely some areas that need to be fixed.<p class=message>Gotcha. Where did you find those vulnerabilities?<p class="message sent">Mostly around access controls and authentication mechanisms. It's nothing we can't fix though.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Did you get a chance to test our backup and disaster recovery plans?<p class="message sent">Yeah, everything went smoothly on that end. We were able to quickly restore the database after a simulated disaster.<p class=message>Excellent. It's always good to have a solid backup plan. So, what's the plan to fix these vulnerabilities?<p class="message sent">Well, we're going to start by improving our access controls and implementing some additional authentication measures. We'll also do some code reviews and tighten up our configurations.<p class=message>Makes sense. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Do you think the fixes will have any impact on user experience?<p class="message sent">It shouldn't. We're just adding some extra security measures, so users won't notice any difference.<p class=message>Perfect. I'm glad we're on top of this. Is there anything else we need to do?<p class="message sent">We should probably schedule another pen test in a few months to make sure everything is secure. Other than that, we're good!<p class=message>Great! Thanks for the update, B. Keep up the good work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b104e140-c1f0-4cf1-9d54-96216e386714.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
