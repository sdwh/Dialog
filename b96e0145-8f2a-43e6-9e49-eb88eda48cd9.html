What kind of website are we developing today?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing great. We're developing a website that offers real-time interaction. It's going to be awesome.<p class=message>That does sound awesome. What kind of tools are you planning on using for the front-end?<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking of using React for the UI since it's pretty quick and easy to develop with.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting. Are you concerned about any performance issues with real-time data transfer?<p class="message sent">Actually, I've been looking into WebSocket for the server-side communication. It should be perfect for this kind of application.<p class=message>Nice. I think we'll need a good database solution for storing all the real-time data. Have you thought about that?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I was thinking of using MongoDB. It's a NoSQL database that can handle real-time data.<p class=message>That's smart. What about user authentication? Should we implement OAuth2 or some other authentication method?<p class="message sent">Yeah, OAuth2 would be ideal since it's a widely accepted standard. Plus, it's secure and pretty easy to use.<p class=message>Makes sense to me. What about the design of the website? Do you have any ideas?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of using a clean and modern design with plenty of white space. We could maybe incorporate some subtle animations as well.<p class=message>I like the sound of that. What about the color scheme?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of using some pastel colors since they tend to be more calming and easier on the eyes.<p class=message>Sounds good. Do we have any specific features we want to add to the site?<p class="message sent">Well, we could maybe add some real-time chat functionality or some kind of virtual whiteboard for collaborative brainstorming.<p class=message>Those are some great ideas. Do you think we can have everything ready in time for the deadline?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I think we have a solid plan here and we can get it all done on time.<p class=message>Awesome, let's get to work then. This is going to be an exciting project.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b968dc4f-f821-4a11-9636-d0a1f809ff00.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
