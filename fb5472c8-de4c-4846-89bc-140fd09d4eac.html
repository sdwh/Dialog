I'm excited to start roasting these coffee beans today.<p class="message sent">Good morning! I can't wait to taste what you come up with. What type of beans do we have?<p class=message>We have some Colombian beans and Tanzanian beans. Both are Arabica, so they should make for a great cup of coffee.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! I love a good Arabica bean. So, how long does it usually take to roast a batch of beans?<p class=message>It depends on the roast level we want to achieve. For a light roast, it may take around 10-12 minutes. For a darker roast, it might take up to 20 minutes.<p class="message sent">Interesting. Do you prefer a light or dark roast personally?<p class=message>It really depends on my mood. But I usually prefer a medium roast because it has a good balance of acidity and sweetness.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I think most of our customers prefer the same. By the way, do you have any tips for brewing the perfect cup of coffee?<p class=message>Yes, of course! One of the most important things is to use freshly roasted beans and filtered water. Also, make sure to grind the beans just before brewing for the best flavor.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tips! By the way, have you ever tried baking with coffee before?<p class=message>Yes! I love baking with coffee. It adds a great depth of flavor to cakes and brownies.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Maybe we can collaborate on a coffee-flavored dessert in the future.<p class=message>Absolutely! That would be fun to do. Alright, the beans are ready for tasting. Let's brew some coffee and sample them.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I can't wait to have a taste of your expertise.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fb53aa49-de79-43f1-b113-b0ac57b5dfa0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
