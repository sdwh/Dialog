Please have a seat.<p class="message sent">Good afternoon, officer. Thank you for seeing me.<p class=message>So, Mr. B, can you tell me where you were on the night of the break-in?<p class="message sent">I was at home, officer. I was binge-watching my favorite show on Netflix.<p class=message>Do you have anyone who can verify that?<p class="message sent">Well, my cat was there with me, but I don't think she can testify.<p class=message>(smiling) I see. What about your neighbors? Did they hear or see anything unusual that night?<p class="message sent">Not that I'm aware of, officer. But to be honest, my neighbors are always noisy, so I don't pay much attention to their comings and goings.<p class=message>(chuckles) Understood. Well, we'll have to check your alibi and gather more evidence before we can clear you.<p class="message sent">That's fine, officer. I have nothing to hide.<p class=message>(nodding) That's good to hear. By the way, did you know that stealing candy from a store is still considered stealing?<p class="message sent">(surprised) What? Even if it's just a small candy bar?<p class=message>Yes, sir. It doesn't matter how big or small the item is. Stealing is still against the law.<p class="message sent">(scratching his head) I didn't know that. Well, in that case, I should probably confess that I took a pack of gum yesterday.<p class=message>(laughing) Don't worry, sir. We're not here to arrest you for gum stealing.<p class="message sent">(smiling) That's a relief. Thank you for being so understanding, officer.<p class=message>No problem, sir. Let's focus on the burglary case for now. We'll get to the gum stealing later.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a7cb7c19-adb7-494d-977c-854a3fe631fd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
