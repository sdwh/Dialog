How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey, not bad. I'm just getting ready to start brewing our latest batch of beer. You ready to get your hands dirty?<p class=message>Absolutely! So, what's the plan for today?<p class="message sent">Today we're going to brew a South African-inspired beer. I've got this great ingredient called Rooibos tea that I think will really bring out some interesting flavors.<p class=message>Rooibos tea? That's a spice I haven't worked with before.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's actually not a spice. It's a tea made from the leaves of a South African plant. But trust me, it's going to add some amazing complexity to the beer.<p class=message>Alright, I'm excited to see how it turns out. What's the brewing process for this recipe?<p class="message sent">We'll first need to combine our malted barley and water in the mash tun, and then we'll add the Rooibos tea during the boil. After that, we'll transfer the mixture to the fermenter and add the yeast.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. How long will the whole process take?<p class="message sent">It will take around 3-4 weeks for the beer to ferment and condition, but it will be worth the wait.<p class=message>Definitely worth it! So, what's the name of this new beer?<p class="message sent">We're calling it The African Sunrise. I think it's fitting for the unique flavor profile we're creating.<p class=message>I like it! Let's get to work and create some magic.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's follow the recipe and make sure we brew up a great batch of The African Sunrise.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=be759cc0-8a57-456e-9d9e-8a4ce25789af.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
