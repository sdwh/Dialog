In fact, scientists estimate that there are over a million species in the ocean, but we’ve only discovered less than 10%.<p class=message>That’s incredible! Imagine the number of creatures we’ve yet to discover.<p class="message sent">It truly is fascinating. Just last year, a new species of octopus was discovered near Hawaii. It’s amazing how much we still have to learn about our oceans.<p class=message>Speaking of octopuses, did you know that they have three hearts and blue blood?<p class="message sent">Yes, and they are also incredibly intelligent and can camouflage to blend in with their surroundings.<p class=message>It’s simply amazing how complex marine life can be. What’s your favorite marine animal?<p class="message sent">I have to say, I’m a big fan of sea turtles. They are so graceful and peaceful.<p class=message>I couldn’t agree more. They travel thousands of miles during their lifetime yet always return to the same beach to lay their eggs.<p class="message sent">It’s admirable, isn’t it? They’re like the backpackers of the sea.<p class=message>(laughs) That’s a great way to put it. But let’s not forget about the clownfish, made famous by Nemo.<p class="message sent">Ah yes, the clownfish, or as scientists call them, anemonefish, are quite unique. Did you know they can actually change sex?<p class=message>Really? That’s fascinating. I think we’ll never stop discovering new facts and species in the ocean.<p class="message sent">That’s the beauty of the ocean. There’s always something new to discover and learn.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d6668186-911c-416c-8fb9-1375df88267e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
