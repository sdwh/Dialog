Just optimizing the database queries and fixing some bugs.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I'm almost done with the front-end design. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Well, it looks great already. But have you considered the loading time? Maybe we can compress the images to speed things up.<p class=message>Oh, I haven't thought of that. Thanks for the reminder! By the way, have you tried the new coffee machine in the break room?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had the chance. Is it any good?<p class=message>It's amazing! It's like having a barista in the office.<p class="message sent">Ha! That sounds tempting. Maybe I'll take a break and try it out.<p class=message>Speaking of breaks, have you been taking a lot of them lately? I noticed you've been playing ping-pong quite often.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, I try to take a break and clear my mind every now and then. You should join me sometime.<p class=message>I'd love to, but I don't think I'm very good at it. I might embarrass myself.<p class="message sent">Don't worry about it. It's all about having fun. Plus, I can teach you a few tricks.<p class=message>Okay, you're on! But first, let's get back to work. Do you have any pending tasks that I can assist with?<p class="message sent">Actually, I need your help with integrating a new API into our system.<p class=message>Sure thing. Let's work on it together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0f3313e4-3651-4196-943d-103e78616547.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
