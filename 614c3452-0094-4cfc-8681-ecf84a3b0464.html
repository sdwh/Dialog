And if you want to be really polite, you can say "Gochisousama deshita" after the meal.<p class=message>"Gochisousama deshita"? That's a mouthful. What does it mean?<p class="message sent">It's a way to thank the chef and express gratitude for the meal.<p class=message>That's really cool. I'll definitely remember that.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's head over to the sushi bar.<p class=message>The colors and presentation of the sushi are so beautiful.
