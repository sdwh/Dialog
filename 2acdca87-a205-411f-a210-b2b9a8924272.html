But don't worry, a little cold won't hurt you!<p class=message>I guess you're right. So what are we working on today?<p class="message sent">Today, we're going to focus on your footwork. Making sure your movements are swift and precise.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. So, any tips to help me improve?<p class="message sent">Yes, as you're moving, try not to look at your feet too much. Keep your eyes on the ball and let your muscle memory do the work.<p class=message>Got it! And any fun drills we can do to keep it interesting?<p class="message sent">How about we do some ladder drills? We can add some music and make it into a mini dance party to keep it fun.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea! So, what kind of music do you like to listen to while coaching?<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm a big fan of 80s music! The beat is perfect for keeping a steady pace during drills.<p class=message>Wow, I wouldn't have guessed that! Do you have any favorite 80s bands?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Duran Duran is definitely a favorite of mine. What about you, any favorite bands or musicians?<p class=message>I'm a big fan of Beyonce. Her songs always get me pumped up and ready to go.<p class="message sent">Hey, whatever works for you! Alright, let's get started with those ladder drills. Ready, set, go!<p class=message>(laughing) Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2ac9e3ff-2394-4e90-aa17-2419361a0b5d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
