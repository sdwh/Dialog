Thanks for coming over to help with the repairs.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. What seems to be the issue?<p class=message>Well, the engine is making a weird rattling noise and the brakes aren't as responsive as they used to be.<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me take a look. Ah, here's the problem – you've got a loose bolt on the engine mount. And the brake pads have worn down quite a bit.<p class=message>Oh man, I thought I checked everything before the race. Thanks for catching that.<p class="message sent">That's what I'm here for. It's all part of the exciting world of racing, right?<p class=message>Ha, yeah, I guess you could say that. So how long do you think it'll take to fix everything?<p class="message sent">Shouldn't take too long. I can tighten up that bolt and replace the brake pads pretty quickly.<p class=message>Awesome. In the meantime, I'll just sit here and try not to freak out about missing the next race.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, you'll be back out there in no time.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have you ever driven a race car before? It's a rush like no other.<p class="message sent">Actually, I've only ever been a mechanic. But I can imagine the adrenaline rush would be pretty intense.<p class=message>Definitely. Hey, do you have any crazy stories from your years of working in racing?<p class="message sent">Let me see...I once had to replace an entire engine mid-race. Talk about a stressful situation.<p class=message>Whoa, now that's impressive. I guess I shouldn't complain about a couple loose bolts and worn-out brakes.<p class="message sent">Hey, every repair job is important – no matter how big or small. And speaking of which, I think I've got everything fixed up now. Want to give it a test run?<p class=message>Absolutely! Let's see how she handles. Thanks again for your help, B. You're a lifesaver.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5038f215-c7a3-4da4-80ba-cdb0092c1b50.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
