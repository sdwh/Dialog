Welcome to our restaurant. What can I get for you tonight?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I would recommend trying our famous meat pie made with Australian beef. It's a must-try dish here.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! Are there any sides that go well with it?<p class="message sent">Definitely! How about trying the crispy shoestring fries or the refreshing garden salad?<p class=message>Those both sound great. What do you think about trying the fries, and a local Australian beer to go with it?<p class="message sent">Perfect choice. Iâ€™ll get that order started and have it ready for you in no time.<p class=message>Thank you! By the way, do you have any fun facts about Australian cuisine that you could share with me?<p class="message sent">Of course! Did you know that lamingtons, a popular Australian dessert, were named after Lord Lamington, the Governor of Queensland in the late 1800s?<p class=message>Wow, I didn't know that! Thank you for sharing. Do you have any other recommendations for traditional Aussie dishes?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! You should definitely try a classic Aussie burger, which is usually served with beetroot and a fried egg. It's a staple dish here.<p class=message>That sounds tasty. I love trying new foods. Speaking of, do any of your dishes cater to customers with dietary restrictions?<p class="message sent">We do have vegetarian and gluten-free options available. Our vegetarian lasagna and gluten-free fish and chips are both very popular choices.<p class=message>That's great to hear. It's always good to have a variety of options. Thank you for your help and suggestions.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! I hope you enjoy your meal and have a great evening.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=40758052-3b22-460d-abe1-a0570fc2193d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
