My name is Officer A and I'm here to assist you in any way possible. Can you please state your name and current address?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon, Officer A. My name is John Smith and I live on 123 Main Street.<p class=message>Thank you, Mr. Smith. We received a report that you were seen near the scene of a recent burglary. Can you tell me where you were at the time of the incident?<p class="message sent">Oh, I was just on my way home from work. I didn't see or hear anything suspicious.<p class=message>That's interesting. We have security footage that shows someone matching your description near the location. Is there anything you'd like to share with me?<p class="message sent">(chuckles) Well, I do have a twin brother. Maybe it was him?<p class=message>(smiling) I see. Do you mind if we take a look at your ID and ask you a few more questions?<p class="message sent">Of course not, Officer. I have nothing to hide.<p class=message>Can you tell me a bit more about your brother? Does he also live in the area?<p class="message sent">Yes, he does. We look very similar, but he has a small tattoo on his right wrist.<p class=message>Alright, we'll keep that in mind. In the meantime, I'm going to need to ask you to empty your pockets and remove any metal objects.<p class="message sent">(smirks) You won't find anything incriminating, Officer.<p class=message>(chuckles) I hope not. Let's head over to the processing area and we'll take care of everything.<p class="message sent">(sighs) Well, this has certainly been an eventful evening.<p class=message>(smiling) Indeed it has. But don't worry, Mr. Smith. We'll get to the bottom of this and hopefully clear things up soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d14784b4-dbef-4343-867b-e1d558324664.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
