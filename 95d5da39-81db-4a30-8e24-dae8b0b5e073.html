What's up?<p class="message sent">Not much, just playing this new puzzle game. Want to join?<p class=message>Sure, I love puzzle games. What's the objective of this game?<p class="message sent">You have to match the shapes and colors to get to the next level. It gets trickier as you go.<p class=message>That sounds challenging. Do you have any tips for me?<p class="message sent">Yeah, take your time and don't rush. Sometimes the best solution is not the most obvious one.<p class=message>I see. So, have you gotten far in the game yet?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm on level 10 right now. It's getting pretty tough.<p class=message>Wow, you're crushing it. I just started, so I'm still on level 1.<p class="message sent">No worries, we can play together and figure it out. It's always more fun to play with a friend.<p class=message>Absolutely, let's team up. By the way, have you tried any other puzzle games that you recommend?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I love playing Tetris and Sudoku. They're classic puzzle games that never get old.<p class=message>Oh, I remember playing Tetris as a kid. Haven't tried Sudoku though. I'll check it out.<p class="message sent">Definitely do, it's a great game to boost your mental capacity. Okay, we're on level 2, let's focus!<p class=message>Got it. Let me move this piece here...and done! We did it!<p class="message sent">Nice job, we make a great team. We'll conquer this game in no time!<p class=message>Thanks for your help. Hey, do you want to grab some food after this? I know a great sandwich shop nearby.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm always up for a good sandwich. Let's finish this level first though!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=95d50933-b36e-4245-b98f-096cfb124a6b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
