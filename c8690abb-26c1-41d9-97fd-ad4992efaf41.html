How's it going with the latest feature we're working on?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, but there's still a bit of debugging to do.<p class=message>Ah, yeah. Debugging can be a real pain sometimes, but it's worth it in the end.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Hey, you know what would make this whole thing easier? A teleportation device so we can jump into the code and fix it in real time.<p class=message>Haha, wouldn't that be amazing? But then we'd have to worry about bugs in the teleportation system too.<p class="message sent">True, true. Maybe we should stick to debugging the old-fashioned way for now.<p class=message>Agreed. Hey, have you checked out the new extension available on Visual Studio? It's supposed to make debugging even easier.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class=message>It's called "OzCode." Apparently, it helps to simplify debugging by visualizing the code execution flow.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. I'll definitely have to give it a try.<p class=message>Yeah, and if it works well, maybe we can convince the boss to invest in it for the whole team.<p class="message sent">That would be awesome. I'm just glad we have such a great team to work with.<p class=message>Me too. And speaking of the team, have you noticed how many snacks we have in the breakroom lately? It's like a mini convenience store.<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah. I think we have enough snacks to last through a zombie apocalypse.<p class=message>Who needs brains when you've got chips and candy, right?<p class="message sent">Exactly. But seriously, we should probably pace ourselves or we'll never fit through the office door.<p class=message>Good point. Maybe we should save some of the snacks for after work, when we can relax and watch some Netflix.<p class="message sent">Now there's an idea. Alright, let's get back to it. We'll have this feature finished in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c868eff5-9080-430e-82ed-4df4e91c9eae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
