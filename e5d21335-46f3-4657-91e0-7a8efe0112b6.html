Are you B, the software engineer on this project?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. Nice to meet you, A.<p class=message>Nice to meet you too, B. Let's dive into the audit, shall we? Can you walk me through the security control measures you have implemented in your software?<p class="message sent">Sure, we have implemented various security measures like two-factor authentication, encryption, and regular vulnerability assessments.<p class=message>That's great to hear.

But, I have a question - do you guys have a regular password changing policy in place?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do have a password changing policy but we also support the use of password managers for a stronger and more secure method of managing passwords.<p class=message>Fantastic. It's always great to see software developers taking proactive measures to encourage better password hygiene.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A.
