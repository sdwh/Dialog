I'm a fruit farmer. Welcome to our orchard!<p class="message sent">Hi Alex, nice to meet you. My name is Brian. I heard that your fruits are the best in town.<p class=message>Thank you, Brian. We take pride in the quality of our produce. What kind of fruit do you like to cook with?<p class="message sent">I love making desserts with berries. Do you have any in season right now?<p class=message>Yes, we have a lot of strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries at the moment. Would you like to pick some to use for your recipe?<p class="message sent">That would be great! Let's get picking.<p class=message>It's so nice having fresh fruits straight from the orchard.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's also great to know where our food is coming from and how it's grown.<p class=message>Definitely. So, what kind of dessert do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">Maybe a fruit tart with a custard filling? Or a berry crumble?<p class=message>Both sound delicious. How about we make both?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan.<p class=message>It's been a while since I've cooked with someone. This is fun.<p class="message sent">Same here. It's always better to cook with someone else.<p class=message>This custard filling smells amazing. And those berries look so vibrant.<p class="message sent">It's almost done. Just need to pop it in the oven.<p class=message>Wow, this is fantastic. The combination of our fruits and your cooking skills made these desserts perfect.<p class="message sent">I agree, it's a great collaboration. We should do this again sometime.<p class=message>Definitely. How about we go for a hike next time and make a picnic with more of our fruits?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, Alex. I can't wait.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0143138c-fed6-4698-a4c8-42957a23a125.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
