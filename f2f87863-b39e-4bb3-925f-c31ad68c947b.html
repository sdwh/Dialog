What period are you studying?<p class="message sent">Right now we're learning about the American Revolution and the founding fathers.<p class=message>Ah, that's fascinating! Did you know that Benjamin Franklin was not only a founding father, but also a renowned inventor and scientist?<p class="message sent">Really? That's so cool! What did he invent?<p class=message>He invented the lightning rod, bifocal glasses, and even a musical instrument!<p class="message sent">That's impressive. I wish I could invent something like that someday.<p class=message>Maybe you will someday! Speaking of inventions, have you finished your science project yet?<p class="message sent">Almost done. I just need to add the final touches and it'll be ready to present.<p class=message>I'm excited to see it. What did you create?<p class="message sent">I made a solar-powered car that runs solely on sunlight.<p class=message>Wow! You're so creative and clever! You'll make a great inventor one day.<p class="message sent">Thanks, mom! I'll keep working hard and hopefully come up with more cool ideas.<p class=message>I know you will, B. Keep up the good work! Do you need any help with anything else?<p class="message sent">No, I'm good for now. Thanks though, mom!<p class=message>Anytime, son. Keep pushing yourself and you'll go far.<p class="message sent">I will, mom. Thanks for your encouragement!<p class=message>No problem, dear. Now, let's enjoy some dinner and then maybe we can watch a movie together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f2f7d226-3138-45df-a752-d03b7756082d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
