I'm a vegetarian, and I'm excited to try out some vegetarian food in this city.<p class="message sent">Welcome! We have a wide variety of dishes that are all completely vegetarian. What kind of food do you like?<p class=message>I'm a big fan of spicy food. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Our spicy eggplant and tofu stir-fry is a popular choice among our customers. It's flavorful and spicy without being too overpowering.<p class=message>That sounds perfect! I'll definitely give it a try.<p class="message sent">Great choice! Would you like to try any of our sides or appetizers to start off with?<p class=message>Yes, please. Can you recommend something that's unique to your restaurant?<p class="message sent">One of our most popular dishes is the crispy avocado tacos. They're filled with fresh guacamole, shredded lettuce, and a tangy lime crema.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. I'll definitely have to try that as well.<p class="message sent">Wonderful! Is there anything else I can get for you?<p class=message>Actually, I'm really curious about the plant-based protein substitutes you use. Can you tell me more about them?<p class="message sent">Of course! We use a few different types, but we mostly use soy, tempeh, and seitan. They're all great sources of protein and can be used in a variety of dishes.<p class=message>That's really interesting. I've heard a lot about seitan, but I've never actually tried it.<p class="message sent">It's definitely worth trying! We have a BBQ "pulled pork" sandwich that's made with seitan, and it's one of our most popular dishes.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I might have to come back another time to try it.<p class="message sent">We'd love to have you back anytime. Enjoy your meal!<p class=message>Thank you so much, I'm sure I will.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d6212b54-ab67-451f-b82e-a09ab59623e6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
