What seems to be the problem with your current cutlery?<p class=message>Well, it looks like it's been through a war and survived. I think it's time for an upgrade.<p class="message sent">I totally get that. We wouldn't want our utensils to be any less than impeccable. Let me fetch you some shiny, new cutlery.<p class=message>That sounds fantastic. Thank you so much.<p class="message sent">Not a problem. Do you have any preference on the design?<p class=message>Hmm, no preference. Just make sure it's clean and elegant.<p class="message sent">I'll be sure to choose the best ones for you. How about starting with a set of spoons and forks?<p class=message>Great. Oh, and while you're at it, can I also get some fresh napkins too?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Would you like cloth, paper or something special added to them?<p class=message>Just plain cloth napkins will do, thank you.<p class="message sent">Awesome. I'll be back in just a minute with your new cutlery and napkins.<p class=message>Wow, that was quick. Thank you so much. These look brand new!<p class="message sent">I'm glad you're happy with it. Our restaurant wants to make sure each customer has a quality experience.<p class=message>I can tell. I appreciate your attention to detail.<p class="message sent">It's all part of the job. Do let me know if you need anything else, okay?<p class=message>You bet! Thanks again. This is just what I needed to enjoy my meal.<p class="message sent">No worries at all.
