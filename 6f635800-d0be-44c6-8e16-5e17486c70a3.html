I'm glad to have you on my team. So, what's on our menu for today?<p class="message sent">We have a variety of noodle dishes, including spicy beef noodles and seafood noodle soup. I also created a new menu item - black bean sauce noodles!<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting. I'm looking forward to trying it later. Speaking of noodles, do you have any tips for making the perfect noodle?<p class="message sent">Of course, boss A. Firstly, it's important to use high-quality flour and water. Also, don't forget to knead the dough properly and rest it for a while before cutting it into noodles.<p class=message>Ah, I see. That's why our noodles are always so delicious. By the way, have you ever tried any interesting noodle dishes on your travels?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've tried many different types of noodles in Japan and China. One of my favorites is udon noodles served in a hot pot with a raw egg on top.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing! Maybe we can try making that for our customers too.<p class="message sent">Definitely, boss A. I'm always up for a new challenge in the kitchen.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. Keep up the good work, chef B!<p class="message sent">Thank you, boss A.
