Where are we headed today?<p class="message received message-content">I'm on my way to Shanghai for a business trip. How about you?<p class="message sent message-content">Just driving around, trying to make an honest living you know. Do you visit Shanghai often?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, I do. I love the city - the food, the people, the culture. It's always an adventure for me.<p class="message sent message-content">That's great to hear! I've never been to Shanghai myself, but I've heard it's quite a bustling city.<p class="message received message-content">Oh, it definitely is. There's always something new to discover, especially when it comes to food.<p class="message sent message-content">Speaking of food, do you have any recommendations on places to eat while I'm in Shanghai?<p class="message received message-content">Oh, so many places! You can't go wrong with the street food stalls or the local restaurants. If you're feeling adventurous, try some stinky tofu.<p class="message sent message-content">Stinky tofu? Sounds interesting, but I'll have to think about it. I'm not too fond of strong smells.<p class="message received message-content">It's an acquired taste, but definitely worth trying at least once. So, tell me, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent message-content">I've been driving for about 10 years now. It's not the most glamorous job, but it pays the bills.<p class="message received message-content">Well, I appreciate your hard work. You're getting me safely to my destination, and for that I'm grateful.<p class="message sent message-content">Thank you so much! It's always a pleasure to transport passengers like you - friendly and courteous.<p class="message received message-content">Likewise! Hey, it looks like we're almost there. Thanks again for the ride and the great conversation.<p class="message sent message-content">Anytime! Enjoy your stay in Shanghai and have a safe trip back home when you're done.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0539de72-07a6-45c4-b907-f0d43cfbe5e0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
