I'm excited to hear what you have in mind. What's your book about?<p class=message>It's a romantic comedy about a baker who falls in love with a famous chef.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Have you thought about the title yet?<p class=message>Yes, I was thinking of calling it "Baked with Love."<p class="message sent">I like it! So, what's your marketing strategy?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of doing a book tour, partnering with local bakeries, and having sample treats at each event.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. Have you considered doing a giveaway on social media?<p class=message>Yes, I was planning on doing a giveaway of signed copies and some baked goods.<p class="message sent">Perfect. And what about a book trailer?<p class=message>Actually, I already have one. It's a short video of me baking and talking about the book.<p class="message sent">Wow, you've got it all covered! One more thing, have you thought about audiobooks?<p class=message>Yes, I'm actually in talks with a voice actor who specializes in romantic comedies.<p class="message sent">Awesome. It sounds like you've got a solid plan in place. Let's get started on making your dream a reality.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I couldn't have done it without your help.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. I believe in you and your book.
