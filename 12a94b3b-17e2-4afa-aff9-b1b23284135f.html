May I ask why you need an extra pillow?<p class=message>Well, I like to stack them up and make my own little fort to sleep in.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That sounds like a great idea! I'll bring you an extra pillow and see if I can find some extra blankets to add to your fort.<p class=message>Thank you so much! I have to be comfortable to get some sleep on a long flight.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, comfort is key. Are there any other requests I can help you with?<p class=message>Actually, do you have any suggestions for in-flight entertainment? I always struggle to find something to watch.<p class="message sent">We have a great list of movies and TV shows on our in-flight entertainment system. I highly recommend the new comedy series that just came out last month.<p class=message>Oh, I think I've heard about that one. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">My pleasure! Oh, and I almost forgot the most important thing - would you like a snack or a beverage?<p class=message>Definitely! What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Our warm chocolate chip cookies are a crowd favorite, and we also have a new sparkling water flavor that's really refreshing.<p class=message>Sold! I'll have one of each, please.<p class="message sent">Great choices! I'll bring those right over to you. Is there anything else I can get for you?<p class=message>No, that's all for now. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure, enjoy your flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=12a87eec-0e02-4a7e-b1d7-9c41e6d65c83.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
