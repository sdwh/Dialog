Can you tell us about the history of this restaurant?<p class="message sent">Of course, A. This restaurant has been around for over 20 years and it's known for serving modern Australian cuisine.<p class=message>That's really interesting. Speaking of Australian cuisine, what are some popular dishes among locals?<p class="message sent">Well, some must-try dishes here include barramundi, kangaroo steak, and pavlova for dessert. Have you heard of those before?<p class=message>I've heard of barramundi and kangaroo, but what's pavlova?<p class="message sent">Pavlova is a meringue-based dessert that's topped with fresh fruits, usually strawberries and kiwi. It's named after the famous ballerina Anna Pavlova.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. How about the drinks? Are there any signature cocktails here?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a few unique cocktails, like our Wattleseed Espresso Martini and Outback Margarita, which has native Australian spices infused into the tequila.<p class=message>Wow, those sound really interesting. I'll definitely have to try them. Can you also talk about the decor of the restaurant?<p class="message sent">Sure. The decor of the restaurant is inspired by Australia's natural beauty, with lots of wood and earthy tones. We also have some Aboriginal art on display.<p class=message>I love it. It's very welcoming and relaxing. Thank you so much for sharing all of this with us, B.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. I hope you enjoy your meal and drinks here!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bec2e5e6-abb7-4eac-87a9-808b1a686690.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
