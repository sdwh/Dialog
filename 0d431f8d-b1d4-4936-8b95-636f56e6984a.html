What’s up?<p class="message sent">Hey A! Not much, just thinking about how we can better protect the personal data of our school’s students and staff. Any ideas?<p class=message>Well, first we have to make sure all our systems are up-to-date and secure.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We also need to educate our staff and students on how to keep their personal information safe.<p class=message>Yeah, like avoiding clicking on phishing emails and using strong, unique passwords.<p class="message sent">Exactly. We should also limit access to sensitive data and make sure it’s only accessible to those who need it.<p class=message>Ah, yeah. And we could also use encryption to protect data both in transit and at rest.<p class="message sent">Good thinking. And we should also have a plan in place for if a breach does occur.<p class=message>Of course. We need to have measures in place to quickly detect, contain, and mitigate any potential damage.<p class="message sent">Right. And we should perform regular security audits to ensure everything is working as it should.<p class=message>Yes, and stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices.<p class="message sent">That’s key. Do you have any recommendations for resources we can use to stay informed?<p class=message>Sure, there are a lot of great information security websites, podcasts, and online communities out there. I can send you some links.<p class="message sent">Appreciate that! This has been a productive discussion. Let’s keep working together to keep our students and staff safe and secure online.<p class=message>Absolutely! Thanks for having this chat with me, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0d4097ab-5812-47f7-ab06-c86ac3642b50.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
