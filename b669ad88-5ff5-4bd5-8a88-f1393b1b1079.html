I'm a fisherman from the coast nearby.<p class="message sent">Hello, A. I'm B, a professional chef here at this restaurant. It's great to meet you.<p class=message>Nice to meet you too, B. I'm excited to see what kind of dishes we can create with the fresh catch of the day.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. What did you catch?<p class=message>We have some lovely prawns, crabs, and a few different varieties of fish.<p class="message sent">Wonderful. Let's start by preparing the prawns. How do you usually cook them?<p class=message>Well, we usually just grill them with some garlic butter and parsley.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that sounds delicious. How about we also add a bit of chili to give it a little kick?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds great to me.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's move on to the crabs. Do you prefer them steamed or boiled?<p class=message>I personally like them boiled with some lemon and black pepper. How about you?<p class="message sent">I actually like them steamed with some white wine and garlic.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I can't wait to try it.<p class="message sent">Lastly, let's work on the fish. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Honestly, I think the barramundi is the best one we have right now. It's really fresh and flavorful.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's grill it with some lemon butter and serve it on a bed of roasted vegetables.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. I think our customers will love it.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's great working with fresh and quality ingredients like these. Thanks for bringing them in, A.<p class=message>No problem. It's always a pleasure to work with talented chefs like you, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b6631c40-85b2-40a0-bb4f-5c626a25a463.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
