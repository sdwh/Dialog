It's a way to ensure that a company has a strong information security management system, right?<p class=message>Exactly! And did you know that there are some evaluation criteria that companies need to meet to get certified?<p class="message sent">Really? What kind of criteria?<p class=message>Well, for example, the company needs to have a risk assessment process in place to identify potential security threats.<p class="message sent">Ah, that makes sense. What about policies and procedures?<p class=message>Yeah, they need to have documented policies and procedures that cover all aspects of information security.<p class="message sent">Okay, so what happens if a company doesn't meet those criteria?<p class=message>They won't get certified. But the good news is that they can always make improvements and try again.<p class="message sent">Right, I guess it's a good motivator for companies to stay on top of their security practices.<p class=message>Absolutely. And it's not just important for the company itself, but also for their customers and partners who rely on them to keep their data safe.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I wouldn't want to deal with a company that doesn't take security seriously.<p class=message>Me neither. That's why it's so great that there's a standardized way of evaluating and certifying companies.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And who knows, maybe one day we'll be the ones helping companies get certified.<p class=message>Ha! That would be the day. But for now, let's just focus on improving our own information security practices.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c57f9923-275a-4e8c-9a83-39007dbe63c2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
