What's it called?<p class=message>It's called "Mystery Mansion." It's a really challenging game where you have to solve riddles to uncover secrets in an old mansion.<p class="message sent">That sounds like my kind of game. I love solving puzzles.<p class=message>Great, let's give it a try. We can play together and help each other out.<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds like fun. Do you have it downloaded on your computer?<p class=message>Yes, I do. Let me just start it up. Do you want to join my game or start your own?<p class="message sent">I'll join your game. How many levels have you completed so far?<p class=message>I've only completed the first two levels. It's getting harder but it's also more exciting.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's play. Oh, I think I got the answer for this riddle. It's "time."<p class=message>Wow, you're fast! It's correct. How did you figure it out?<p class="message sent">It's a common theme in mystery games. The answer is almost always time or something related to it.<p class=message>You're right. That makes sense. Let's solve the next riddle together.<p class="message sent">Okay, this one says "I am not alive, but I grow; I don't have lungs, but I need air; I don't have a mouth, but water kills me. What am I?"<p class=message>Hmm, that's a tough one. Let me think. Oh, I got it! It's fire.<p class="message sent">Yes, you're right! Only a few more levels to go, and we can beat this game.<p class=message>Agreed. We make a great puzzle-solving team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f35213e8-429d-46d1-8b7f-5b4a4d8a41d7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
