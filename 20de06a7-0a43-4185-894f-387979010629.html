Where can I take you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Can you take me to downtown Chicago, please?<p class=message>Sure thing! Buckle up and we'll be on our way. Do you know the traffic rules in this city?<p class="message sent">Not really, can you give me a quick rundown?<p class=message>Of course! There are a lot of one-way streets downtown, so keep an eye out for signs. Also, no turns on red unless there's a sign indicating it's allowed.<p class="message sent">Got it. And what about speed limits?<p class=message>It's usually 30 miles per hour unless you're on a highway or expressway. And don't forget, it's illegal to use your phone while driving in Illinois.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the heads up. What about pedestrians?<p class=message>Pedestrians always have the right of way, so be prepared to stop at crosswalks.<p class="message sent">Alright, that's good to know. How about parking?<p class=message>There are plenty of parking garages downtown, but make sure to read the signs because some streets have restricted parking during certain times.<p class="message sent">I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the information.<p class=message>No problem! I just want to make sure everyone stays safe and follows the rules of the road. Plus, it's more fun that way!<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's always good to keep things light and enjoyable.<p class=message>Exactly! And speaking of enjoyable, have you tried the famous deep dish pizza in Chicago?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I'm definitely looking forward to it!<p class=message>You're in for a treat. It's a local specialty and a must-try for all visitors.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=20d4a4fe-1100-477d-9e43-e0ea07853ee1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
