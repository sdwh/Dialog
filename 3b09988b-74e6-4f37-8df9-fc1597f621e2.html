Is it normal to have such heavy traffic in Taipei at this hour?<p class="message sent">Yes, it’s pretty common. Taipei is a bustling city with lots of people on the move.<p class=message>I see. It’s actually my first time here. Any recommendations for food or sights to see while I’m here?<p class="message sent">Definitely try some traditional Taiwanese cuisine like beef noodles and bubble tea. As for sights, the National Palace Museum and Taipei 101 are popular choices.<p class=message>Oh, I’ve heard of those places before. Thanks for the suggestions!<p class="message sent">No problem. Are you here for business or vacation?<p class=message>It’s actually a bit of both. I have a conference to attend but I also plan on exploring the city during my downtime.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a good mix. Have you tried learning any Mandarin Chinese before your trip?<p class=message>Yes, I’ve been practicing a bit but it’s still difficult to remember all the tones.<p class="message sent">I hear you. It takes some time to get the hang of it. But don’t worry, many people here can speak some English.<p class=message>That’s a relief. How long have you been a taxi driver in Taipei?<p class="message sent">I’ve been driving for about 10 years now. It can be tough with the traffic but I enjoy meeting new people.<p class=message>That’s great. I’m glad I got to meet you on my first day here.<p class="message sent">Likewise. If you need any recommendations or help with getting around, don’t hesitate to ask.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. We’re almost at my hotel now. How much do I owe you?<p class="message sent">It’ll be NT$500. Have a great stay in Taipei!<p class=message>Thank you, I will. Take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3b076494-dafe-4377-ab0c-58f87aaf46a9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
