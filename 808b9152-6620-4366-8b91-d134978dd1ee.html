Have you tried our new raspberry tart? It's been flying off the shelves!<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I haven't tried it yet, but it looks amazing. How do you make it so rich in flavor?<p class=message>Our secret is in the raspberry jam we use, which is made from fresh raspberries. We also add a bit of lemon zest to balance out the sweetness.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious. I'll have to try one later. Can I interest you in our coffee of the day?<p class=message>Absolutely! What's the blend?<p class="message sent">It's a mix of Columbian and Ethiopian beans, roasted to perfection. Want to try a sample?<p class=message>Yes, please. Mmm, that's smooth and rich.<p class="message sent">So, how are sales today?<p class=message>It's been busy, as usual. Our cakes and pastries are always popular, but we've also been selling a lot of croissants and bagels this morning.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. We've also had a lot of customers asking for gluten-free options. Do you have any suggestions?<p class=message>Yes, we have a delicious flourless chocolate cake and our almond croissants are gluten-free. We're also working on some new recipes to cater to dietary restrictions.<p class="message sent">I'm sure our customers will appreciate that. By the way, have you tried the new espresso machine? It's a game-changer!<p class=message>Not yet, but I've been dying to. Can you show me how it works?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! It's all about getting the perfect grind and tamp. Here, let me pull you a shot.<p class=message>Wow, that's amazing! I can taste the chocolate and caramel notes.<p class="message sent">Right? And the crema is thick and velvety. It's a great addition to our menu.<p class=message>I agree. It's always exciting to try new things and keep our customers coming back for more.<p class="message sent">That's what it's all about! Well, I have to get back to the counter, but it was great chatting with you, A.<p class=message>You too, B. Thanks for the coffee, and stop by later for some raspberry tarts!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=807ca571-0e4c-4465-b7ac-3d141c68d0f7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
