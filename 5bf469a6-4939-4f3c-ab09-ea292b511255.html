My name is A, and I'll be your instructor for today. Have you done yoga before, B?<p class="message sent">Hi A! I'm excited to start this class. Yes, I've done yoga a few times before. But it's been a while since I last practiced.<p class=message>No worries, we'll start with some basic poses and work our way up. Let's begin with some easy breathing exercises to warm up.<p class="message sent">That sounds good to me. I always struggle with my breathing during yoga practice.<p class=message>Just remember to focus on your inhales and exhales, and you'll do great. Alright, let's move on to some standing poses. We'll start with the mountain pose.<p class="message sent">This one seems easy enough. How long do we hold it?<p class=message>Around 5-10 breaths, depending on how comfortable you feel. Now, let's move on to warrior II.<p class="message sent">Ah, this one is a bit challenging for me. But I'm up for the challenge.<p class=message>Great attitude, B! Remember, it's not about how perfect your pose looks, but how it feels to your body. Okay, let's switch to some seated poses now.<p class="message sent">Can we do the child's pose? That's my favorite one.<p class=message>Of course! It's a great way to relax and stretch out your back. And finally, we'll end with the corpse pose for the final relaxation.<p class="message sent">The corpse pose always makes me feel so calm and relaxed. I love it.<p class=message>Me too, B. It's the perfect way to end a yoga practice. Alright, that's our class for today. Well done, everyone!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5bf39fca-da0a-4c32-9bbc-e789e37d0682.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
