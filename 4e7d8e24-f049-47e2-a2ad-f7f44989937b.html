I hear we're both working on the new smart home system.<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm the IoT engineer for the project. What's your role?<p class=message>I'm the software engineer. We're going to need to work closely to make sure everything runs smoothly.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Do you have any initial suggestions for the software we can use?<p class=message>Well, we need a platform that can integrate with a wide range of devices. Maybe we should consider an open source solution?<p class="message sent">That's a great thought. It'll bring down costs too. How about the IoT devices? Have you considered any specific protocols?<p class=message>I was thinking about using Zigbee or Z-Wave. They're both low power consumption and widely used in the industry. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That sounds like a solid plan. We need to make sure our IoT ecosystem has enough reach to cover a wide spectrum of devices.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we should also have a good user interface for monitoring and controlling the devices, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, for sure. We could have a dedicated mobile app or even integrate with virtual assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Hey, did you hear about that viral story where someone's Alexa ordered them hundreds of gallons of milk?<p class="message sent">Haha, yes! We should definitely make sure our system is smart enough not to do that!<p class=message>Agreed! Let's also make sure our system can handle multiple users and integrations with other services too.<p class="message sent">Definitely. With everything we're planning, our smart home system is going to be the talk of the town. I can't wait to see how it all comes together!<p class=message>Me neither. It's going to be an exciting project to work on.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e7c0498-8974-4d2d-9a32-8fc24f3abcf4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
