It's great to be shooting with you today at Hollywood Hills.<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm thrilled to finally shoot with you too! The view here is stunning.<p class=message>Yeah, it's one of my favorite locations in LA. So, do you have any ideas for poses?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about we do something fun and playful? Maybe a candid shot of me jumping or twirling?<p class=message>I like that idea! Let's give it a try. Do you want to change into another outfit first?<p class="message sent">Sure, I brought a couple of options. What do you think would look best against the backdrop?<p class=message>I think the red dress would really pop against the greenery. Do you have any accessories to go with it?<p class="message sent">I brought some earrings and a necklace that could work. Oh, and a hat too!<p class=message>Perfect! We'll definitely incorporate those into the shots. You're already a natural in front of the camera.<p class="message sent">Aw, thank you! I've done this a few times, but your direction makes me feel even more comfortable.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I want you to feel confident and have fun today. Which spot do you want to shoot at first?<p class="message sent">How about by that tree over there? There's a nice breeze and the natural light is really flattering.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Let's get started then, shall we?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1b83ff13-9814-44f9-83a9-79233cf74c48.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
