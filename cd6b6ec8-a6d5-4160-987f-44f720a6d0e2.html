I couldn't help but notice the delicious smell of your soy milk.<p class="message sent">Hi, thank you! And your chicken rice smells absolutely amazing too.<p class=message>Thank you, I take pride in my authentic Singaporean recipe. How's business been for you?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, I have my regulars who come in for their daily fix. How about you?<p class=message>About the same. We should team up and offer a set meal for breakfast, what do you think?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! How about chicken rice with a cup of soy milk?<p class=message>Perfect! We could call it the "Maxwell Combo".<p class="message sent">And we could offer a discount for customers who buy both from us.<p class=message>Agreed. Collaboration is the key to success in the food industry.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Plus, we can both attract new customers this way.<p class=message>I have to say, your English is really good! Have you studied in an English-speaking country before?<p class="message sent">Thank you! No, I haven't, I just practiced a lot with customers who are tourists or expats.<p class=message>That's really impressive. I think we're both doing a great job representing Singapore's diverse culture and cuisine.<p class="message sent">Yes, we are! And we should be proud of it. So, here's to a successful partnership, my friend.<p class=message>Cheers! I look forward to working together with you.<p class="message sent">Same here! And I can't wait to taste your delicious chicken rice.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cd6b0c97-69a5-4a19-8e2b-512bc79b7d65.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
