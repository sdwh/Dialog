I'm a foodie and looking for some good old American cuisine. Can you tell me what your restaurant offers in terms of American food?<p class="message sent">Of course! We have a lot of options to choose from, but some of the most popular dishes are hamburgers, sandwiches, chicken nuggets, hot dogs, and french fries.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! Could you tell me more about the hamburgers? What kind of meat do you use?<p class="message sent">Our hamburgers are made with 100% beef patties, and we have several different types to choose from.
