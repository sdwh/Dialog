How was your day off yesterday?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It was good, thanks for asking. Just spent some time with the family. What about yours?<p class=message>It was great, got some rest and caught up on some reading. Anyway, let's get started. What do we have on the menu today?<p class="message sent">We've got the usual - crispy fried chicken, onion rings, fries, and mozzarella sticks. Oh, and we've got a new special flavor for the chicken: lemon-pepper.<p class=message>Ooh, that sounds interesting! How's it selling?<p class="message sent">Pretty well, I think people are curious to try something new.<p class=message>Great, keep up the good work. Oh, speaking of work, have you finished cleaning the fryer?<p class="message sent">Yes, all done. It's always a tough job, but it needs to be done to keep the food tasting great.<p class=message>Absolutely agree. And how about the inventory, any items we need to restock urgently?<p class="message sent">Actually, we're running low on chicken wings - we might need a delivery sooner than expected.<p class=message>Okay, I'll make sure to call the supplier today. Now, let's talk about our customer service. Anything we need to improve on?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have noticed some customers are having trouble finding a seat during peak hours. Maybe we could add a few more tables?<p class=message>That's a good point. I'll talk to the owner about it. Alright, I think that's all for now. Thanks for the updates, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Let's keep serving up delicious fried food!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=977e6faa-c67d-4a3f-b0d0-c4d8049407b8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
