Today we'll be discussing the history of memes. Who here knows what a meme is?<p class="message sent">Ooh, ooh! I know! It's like a funny picture or video that spreads around the internet.<p class=message>Very good, B. That's exactly right. Now, can anyone tell me what the first meme was?<p class="message sent">Was it the dancing baby from the 90s? I remember seeing that on TV.<p class=message>You're close, but it was actually the "All your base are belong to us" meme from 2001. It's a classic.<p class="message sent">Wow, I didn't know that. So memes have been around for almost 20 years now?<p class=message>Yes, and they've only gotten more popular over time. What's your favorite meme, B?<p class="message sent">Definitely the "distracted boyfriend" meme, where the guy looks back at the girl while his girlfriend gets mad.<p class=message>Ah yes, that's a good one. Did you know that many memes actually originate from movies or TV shows?<p class="message sent">Really? That's interesting. I had no idea.<p class=message>Yes, even some of the most popular memes like "I'm not a robot" were originally from TV commercials. It's crazy how they spread.<p class="message sent">It really is. I love how memes can bring people together and make them laugh, no matter where they are in the world.<p class=message>Absolutely. Memes are a great way to connect and share a sense of humor. Well, that's all the time we have for today. I'll see you all next week for our discussion on viral TikTok trends.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Professor A.
