I'm heading to Wuhan for a business trip.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting! What kind of business do you do?<p class=message>I work in the fashion industry. We're attending a trade show to showcase our new collection.<p class="message sent">Fashion, eh? That's impressive. What's your specialty?<p class=message>We specialize in creating sustainable fashion using recycled materials.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's very commendable.

I bet you get to meet all sorts of interesting people in your line of work.<p class="message sent">Definitely! It's one of the perks of the job. What about you? What's the funniest thing that's happened to you on a business trip?<p class=message>Well, I once had my luggage go missing and had to attend a meeting wearing a tracksuit!<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's embarrassing, but also pretty funny. I hope you managed to retrieve your luggage eventually.<p class=message>Yes, thankfully it was delivered to me the next day. By the way, do you have any tips for me to make the most of my trip to Wuhan?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! You should definitely try their local cuisine, especially the hot and dry noodles.
