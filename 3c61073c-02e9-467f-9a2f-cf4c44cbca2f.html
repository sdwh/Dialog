How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It's been really busy here at the coffee shop. We've had a lot of customers coming in.<p class=message>That's great to hear! I love it when we're busy. What kind of drinks and snacks have people been ordering today?<p class="message sent">Well, we've had a lot of people ordering lattes, cappuccinos, and iced coffee. As for snacks, our pastries and breakfast sandwiches have been really popular.<p class=message>Yum! I love a good pastry. Have you tried our blueberry muffins yet? They're my favorite.<p class="message sent">I haven't, but I'll have to grab one during our break. Speaking of breaks, when do you think we'll get a chance to take one?<p class=message>Hmm, let me check the schedule. It looks like we'll have a break around noon. We could sit outside and enjoy the sunshine.<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic. I love soaking up some vitamin D during my breaks.<p class=message>Same here! It's the perfect way to recharge for the rest of the day. Speaking of recharging, have you seen the new charger we have for customers' phones and laptops?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. How does it work?<p class=message>It's really cool. Customers can use it to charge their devices, and it even has multiple ports so people can charge more than one device at a time.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's really convenient. I'll have to let our customers know about that.<p class=message>Definitely. It's always great to have an extra perk for our customers. I think that's what keeps them coming back.<p class="message sent">I agree. This coffee shop has a great atmosphere, and the little things like the phone charger make it even better.<p class=message>Absolutely. Well, I better get back to making drinks. It looks like we have another rush coming in.<p class="message sent">Good luck! I'll hold down the fort here at the register.<p class=message>Thanks, B. You're the best!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3c6016c8-8bed-4cf7-9879-270b16703513.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
