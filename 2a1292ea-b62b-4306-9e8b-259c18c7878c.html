What query do you have regarding baggage claim?<p class=message>I'm unable to locate the baggage belt for my flight. Could you tell me which one it is?<p class="message sent">Of course, which airline did you travel with?<p class=message>I flew in with Emirates.<p class="message sent">Okay, then you need to look for belt number 12. That's where Emirates' luggage is being unloaded.<p class=message>Great, thanks for the information. By the way, how do you guys manage the mix-up of luggage of different passengers?<p class="message sent">Well, a barcode tag is attached to each piece of luggage which contains the details of its owner. Our staff members use this tag to scan the luggage and match it with their flight details.<p class=message>That sounds safe and secure. What's the funniest thing that you have witnessed while checking in luggage?<p class="message sent">We have witnessed people trying to sneak in their pets into the baggage. Once we found a live fish in a plastic bag in someone's luggage!<p class=message>That's hilarious! Thanks for sharing that. I will definitely be more careful with my packing the next time I travel.<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed, packing smartly is important. Is there anything else that I can assist you with?<p class=message>No, that's all for now. Thanks for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Have a pleasant journey and we hope to see you again soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a0f1177-3d7b-4dfe-9287-79e5d9d64a4e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
