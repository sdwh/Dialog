What would you recommend?<p class="message sent">Well, our garlic butter is always a hit, but I'm personally a fan of our marinara sauce.<p class=message>Hmm, tough choice! Can I get one of each?<p class="message sent">Of course! I'll bring those extra long breadsticks out to you shortly. Anything else I can get for you in the meantime?<p class=message>Yes, actually. Do you have any recommendations for a good entree?<p class="message sent">Definitely! Our seafood linguine is a customer favorite, but if you're in the mood for something a bit more meaty, our filet mignon is to die for.<p class=message>Oh, that linguine sounds delicious! I'll go with that.<p class="message sent">Great choice, I'll get that started for you. Would you like a glass of wine to go with that?<p class=message>Yes, please! What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">If you like a crisp white wine, I highly recommend our Pinot Grigio. If you prefer something a bit bolder, our Cabernet Sauvignon is a wonderful choice.<p class=message>I'll go with the Pinot Grigio. Thank you for the suggestion!<p class="message sent">My pleasure, I'll bring that out to you as well. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>No, that's everything for now. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">You're very welcome. Enjoy your meal, and those extra long breadsticks!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=71e89b2d-1a5d-4941-afee-15c5ff1a9c91.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
