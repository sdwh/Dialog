How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm looking for some medicine for my baby. She's been coughing and has a runny nose.<p class=message>Oh, I see. How old is your baby?<p class="message sent">She's just 8 months old.<p class=message>Alright, we have some options for infants that are safe and effective. Have you tried giving her saline nasal drops?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. But she still has a persistent cough. What do you recommend for that?<p class=message>We have some cough syrup specifically made for infants. It's safe and doesn't contain any harmful ingredients.<p class="message sent">Great! What about a fever? I read that infants can't have certain medications.<p class=message>That's correct. We have some infant acetaminophen that's safe for babies over 6 months old to reduce fever. But I would recommend consulting with your pediatrician before giving any medication.<p class="message sent">Okay, thank you so much. You've been very helpful!<p class=message>Of course, happy to help. Let me know if there's anything else you need.<p class="message sent">Actually, do you have any recommendations for teething relief?<p class=message>Yes, we have some teething toys and teething gels that can be applied to the gums. They can provide some comfort for your baby during this stage.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Thank you again for your help. I'll definitely come back if I have any more questions.<p class=message>You're welcome! Take care and have a great day.<p class="message sent">You too! Bye!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b9782d50-593f-4b37-abfb-e93b2c3bfa1e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
