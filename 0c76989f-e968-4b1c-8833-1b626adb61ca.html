I need your help with this report.<p class="message sent message-content">Sure, what can I do for you?<p class="message received message-content">I'm struggling with the data analysis section. Do you have any tips?<p class="message sent message-content">Well, have you tried using pivot tables? They work wonders for organizing and summarizing data.<p class="message received message-content">That's a great suggestion. I'll try that. Oh, by the way, did you hear about the office party next week?<p class="message sent message-content">No, I haven't. What's it about?<p class="message received message-content">It's a surprise party for our boss's birthday. We're all supposed to wear silly hats!<p class="message sent message-content">(laughs) That sounds like fun. I'll make sure to bring my most ridiculous hat.<p class="message received message-content">(laughs) Me too! I heard they're bringing in a photo booth for the occasion.<p class="message sent message-content">Awesome! I'll make sure not to miss that.<p class="message received message-content">Speaking of photo booths, have you ever been to a wedding with one?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, my cousin had one at her wedding. It was so much fun.<p class="message received message-content">I went to one recently and was surprised at the variety of props they had to choose from.<p class="message sent message-content">That's one of the best parts. Did you take any silly pictures?<p class="message received message-content">Oh, yes. I dressed up as a cowboy and had a sword fight with a friend who was a pirate.<p class="message sent message-content">(laughs) That's hilarious. You have to show me those pictures sometime.<p class="message received message-content">Sure, I'll bring them to the office party next week. We can make a mini-album for our boss.<p class="message sent message-content">Good idea. It'll be a nice keepsake for him.<p class="message received message-content">Definitely. Thanks for your help, B. I think I have a better handle on this report now.<p class="message sent message-content">No problem, that's what coworkers are for.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0c766546-5b10-4f5d-9d51-24850966d023.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
