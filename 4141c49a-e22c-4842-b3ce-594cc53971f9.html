It's a security management standard that outlines how to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve an information security management system (ISMS).<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've heard something about it but haven't really looked into it. Why, what's up?<p class=message>Well, I was just wondering if you knew about the security incident that happened last week?<p class="message sent">No, what happened?<p class=message>It was a data breach, apparently someone hacked into the system from outside and stole sensitive information.<p class="message sent">That's not good, how did they manage to get in?<p class=message>Well, that's exactly the point of ISO 27001. It provides guidelines on how to assess and manage security risks, and how to implement controls to prevent incidents like this from happening.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. So, was the company compliant with ISO 27001?<p class=message>I don't know for sure, but I doubt it. If they were, they would have had better security measures in place.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's true. By the way, have you taken the TOEIC test before?<p class=message>No, not yet. Why do you ask?<p class="message sent">I was just curious because your English is really good. I'm actually studying for it right now.<p class=message>Oh, thanks! I've been practicing a lot lately. Do you have any tips for me?<p class="message sent">Sure, make sure you familiarize yourself with the format and types of questions in each section. Also, try to improve your vocabulary and grammar skills, as they will be essential to do well in the test.<p class=message>Great advice, thanks! I think I'll start studying for it too.<p class="message sent">Good idea! It's always good to have a certification that validates your English proficiency.<p class=message>Definitely, it will look great on my resume. Alright, let's get back to ISO 27001, do you think we should implement it in our company?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I think it would be a good idea. It will help us manage and secure our information assets better.<p class=message>Agreed. I'll bring it up with the executive team and see if we can get it started. Thanks for the chat, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=413fccdc-a094-438b-a946-152311367b4c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
