There are so many strays in this area.<p class=message>The one with the ridiculous floppy ears and the tail that never stops wagging.<p class="message sent">Oh, that one! Yeah, I see him all the time. He's quite the character.<p class=message>I wonder if he belongs to anyone. We should try to find his owner.<p class="message sent">Good idea. We could ask around and put up some flyers.<p class=message>Speaking of flyers, have you noticed all those missing cat posters plastered everywhere?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's a bit overwhelming. Are we supposed to be on the lookout for them?<p class=message>I don't think so, but it couldn't hurt to keep an eye out. Maybe we'll spot them during our patrols.<p class="message sent">True. Although, I have to admit, I'm a bit more worried about the traffic around here.<p class=message>What's the problem?<p class="message sent">Some of these drivers are absolutely insane. They think they're invincible or something.<p class=message>Tell me about it. I had to jump out of the way of a speeding scooter earlier.<p class="message sent">At this rate, we'll need a pay raise just to cover our medical bills.<p class=message>(laughs) Yeah, let's hope it doesn't come to that. Alright, let's continue our patrol. Keep an eye out for that dog and any other suspicious activity.<p class="message sent">Will do, partner. Let's keep this city safe!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a71f4047-dd35-45a8-b319-1cf60f01506f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
