He's a wizard with networks. What about him?<p class=message>Well, the education institution wants us to optimize the school's network system. Do you think he can help us out?<p class="message sent">I'm positive he can. We can collaborate and come up with a better plan for the school's network.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I was thinking about getting an external consultant, but it's better to have someone in-house.<p class="message sent">Exactly. It's better to have someone who understands the school's network infrastructure than to hire someone who has to learn about it.<p class=message>Do you think we should treat him to lunch to welcome him to the team?<p class="message sent">That's an excellent idea. I'm sure he'll appreciate it. We can also discuss the school's network system over lunch.<p class=message>Should we go to the new Italian place that just opened down the street?<p class="message sent">Why not? The food there is exquisite. We can talk about everything we need to discuss while enjoying some delicious pasta.<p class=message>Do you think we should bring up the issue about students accessing inappropriate sites on the school's network system during our discussion?<p class="message sent">Definitely. We need to find a solution to that problem, but let's not bring it up during lunch. We can discuss that later in the office.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I'm excited to work with the new network engineer and optimize the school's network.<p class="message sent">Me too. Let's crush it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e1f38a29-7ef0-4cc2-9fff-ea0803220d68.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
