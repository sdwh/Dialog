You?<p class=message>Same here. So, have you heard about the recent thefts around the neighborhood?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's pretty crazy. Seems like some people are getting desperate.<p class=message>Definitely. We need to keep a close eye on things around here.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Hey, did you hear about that guy who tried to steal a cart full of groceries yesterday?<p class=message>No way! How did he even think he could get away with that?<p class="message sent">I have no idea. But they caught him and called the police.<p class=message>Good thing. We can't let anyone get away with that kind of behavior.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And we need to make sure our security cameras are working properly too.<p class=message>That's a good point. We don't want to miss anything important.<p class="message sent">Yeah, especially now that the holiday season is coming up. It's going to be busy.<p class=message>It sure is. But we can handle it, right?<p class="message sent">Of course. We make a great team.<p class=message>That we do.
