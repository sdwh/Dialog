What are you up to?<p class="message sent">Hi mom! I'm trying to sew the hem on this skirt. It's not as easy as it looks.<p class=message>Yeah, sewing can be tricky. Remember when I sewed my finger by accident?<p class="message sent">Oh my god, yes! That was scary. Are you okay now?<p class=message>Ha! Yes, I'm fine. I learned my lesson though - always watch where you're putting your fingers when you're sewing.<p class="message sent">Good advice. So, what are you working on?<p class=message>I'm fixing your dad's shirt. He caught it on something and it ripped. But I think I can save it.<p class="message sent">You're like a superhero with a needle and thread! I wish I had your skills.<p class=message>Thanks, sweetie. But you'll get there with more practice.<p class="message sent">I hope so. I have so many ideas for things I want to make!<p class=message>That's great. What do you want to make first?<p class="message sent">I think I want to try making a dress. I have a pattern that looks super cute.<p class=message>That sounds ambitious! But I have faith in you. Let me know how it goes.<p class="message sent">Will do! So, mom, what's the craziest thing you've ever sewn?<p class=message>Hmm...Well, I once made a Halloween costume for your uncle that was supposed to look like a giant hotdog.<p class="message sent">Ha! That's hilarious.<p class=message>Yes...It didn't turn out as well as I hoped, though. He ended up looking more like a giant banana.<p class="message sent">Oh no! Well, at least you tried.<p class=message>Exactly. That's the fun of sewing - sometimes things work out, and sometimes they don't. But no matter what, it's always a learning experience.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Thanks for helping me with my sewing, mom.<p class=message>Anytime, sweetie. It's our little bonding activity!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7c3db907-c80d-42b1-b42f-cb9de4332323.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
