Are you ready for a busy night?<p class="message sent">Hi A! Definitely ready. What do you have planned for tonight's menu?<p class=message>Well, we have the classic fish and chips, roasted pork tenderloin with apples and figs, and vegetarian lasagna. What do you suggest we sell more of?<p class="message sent">Hmm, customers always love fish and chips. But maybe we could suggest the pork dish to those who want something a little different.<p class=message>Great idea! Let's do that. Oh, and can you make sure we have enough ketchup and malt vinegar for the fish and chips?<p class="message sent">Of course, A. And don't worry, I'll check the stock of cutlery and glasses too. We don't want any mishaps tonight.<p class=message>Thank you, B. Oh, and did you see that new customer over there? He's flipping through the menu with a puzzled look on his face.<p class="message sent">Yes, I noticed him too. Maybe he's a bit overwhelmed with all the choices. I'll go over and help him out.<p class=message>Wonderful! You always know how to handle these situations. I'll start prepping the vegetables for the vegetarian lasagna.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, A. You know, I tried your lasagna recipe at home and it was a hit with my family.<p class=message>Really? I'm happy to hear that. Maybe we can include it in the menu more often.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Speaking of which, we should add some seasonal specials on the menu soon. Maybe pumpkin soup or roasted root vegetables?<p class=message>Yes, that's a great idea. Let's discuss it more after we survive tonight's rush.<p class="message sent">Haha, sounds like a plan, A. We make a good team, don't we?<p class=message>Absolutely, B. It's always a pleasure working with you.<p class="message sent">The pleasure is mine, A. Now, let's get cooking and serving!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5adb3c1e-e9c2-4ef2-8de9-ba8de49494e0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
