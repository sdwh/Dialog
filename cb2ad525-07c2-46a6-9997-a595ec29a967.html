Thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks. I'm just a bit nervous about the security check.<p class="message sent">Don't worry. We're just doing our job to keep everyone safe. Can I have your passport and boarding pass, please?<p class=message>Sure, here you go.<p class="message sent">Thank you.

They said it was for their pet.<p class=message>That's hilarious. Did you let it through?<p class="message sent">No, unfortunately, we had to confiscate it. But it made for an interesting day.<p class=message>*laughs* I can imagine. Well, hopefully, nothing strange happens today.<p class="message sent">Let's hope so. *smiles* You're all set.
