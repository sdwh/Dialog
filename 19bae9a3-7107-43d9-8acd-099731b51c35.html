How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! I'm doing pretty well. How about yourself?<p class=message>Can't complain. I'm feeling pretty good today. So, what do you have for me to try?<p class="message sent">I have a new cocktail I've been working on. It's got a spicy kick to it. Want to give it a taste?<p class=message>Ooh, spicy is right up my alley. Let's give it a shot.<p class="message sent">Alright, here you go.<p class=message>Mmm, this is pretty good. What's in it?<p class="message sent">It's a mix of tequila, lime juice, jalapeño syrup, and a dash of bitters.<p class=message>Nice! I can definitely taste the jalapeño. What do you call it?<p class="message sent">I'm still working on that one.<p class=message>Well, let me know when you come up with a great name for it. I'll definitely be ordering one.<p class="message sent">Will do! So, how's business been at the restaurant lately?<p class=message>It's been pretty steady. We just switched up the menu a bit, so that's been keeping things interesting.<p class="message sent">That's cool. I'd love to come by and try some of the new dishes.<p class=message>Absolutely. Let me know when you're free and I'll make sure you're taken care of.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem. So, what other cocktails have you been working on?<p class="message sent">Well, I've been experimenting with a lot of different types of bitters. I feel like it really enhances the flavor of the drink.<p class=message>Interesting. I'll have to let the bartenders at the restaurant know about that. It could make our cocktails even better.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's all about experimenting and finding new ways to bring out the flavors.<p class=message>Agreed. Well, thanks for letting me try your new cocktail. I'll definitely be back for more.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. It's always fun experimenting with new drinks.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=19ba4b33-4043-43ea-814a-f3ff47779e07.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
