Your stall looks amazing. What sort of goodies have you got on offer?<p class="message sent">Hey, thanks! We've got loads of different types of honey concoctions, all made in the traditional style.<p class=message>Yum, I love honey! I've got some traditional French treats for sale too, like croquembouche and crème brûlée.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! Those desserts are so beautifully put together. We can complement each other nicely- sweet honey and flaky pastries!<p class=message>Absolutely! Would you like to try some of my croquembouche as a snack while we work?<p class="message sent">I would love to! This is so good, your pastry cream is really full of flavor.<p class=message>Thanks, it's a family recipe that has been passed down for generations. What's your specialty?<p class="message sent">We've got loads! But if I had to pick a personal favorite, I'd suggest you try our honey and lavender pastilles. They're perfect for when you want just a little something sweet.<p class=message>Oh wow, I had no idea there were so many types of honey. How do you make these lavender pastilles?<p class="message sent">It's a bit of a secret, but I can tell you that we infuse the honey with fresh lavender that we grow ourselves. Then, we mold the mixture into tiny discs.<p class=message>That sounds divine, I can only imagine how fragrant they must be. We should collaborate on a dessert that incorporates both of our specialties!<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely! How about croquembouche filled with a lavender honey cream?<p class=message>Oh wow, that's a great idea. Let's put it on the menu as soon as possible! Speaking of which, we're getting quite a crowd now. Time to get cooking!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Thanks for the collaboration!<p class=message>No problem, let's do it again soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7bd1764c-d97e-49d8-b665-fa2fad66a044.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
