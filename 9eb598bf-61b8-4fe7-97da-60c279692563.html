What do you think?<p class="message sent">I think that's doable, but we also need to factor in time for bug fixes and testing.<p class=message>Good point. How much time do you think we'll need for that?<p class="message sent">I'd say an additional 2-3 weeks.<p class=message>Alright, so that brings us to 2 and a half months. What about the design phase?<p class="message sent">I think we can do that in 2-3 weeks.<p class=message>Great, that brings us to about 3 months. What about the deployment phase?<p class="message sent">I'd say about 1-2 weeks.<p class=message>So that brings us to 3 and a half months. We should also add in buffer time in case we run into any unforeseen issues.<p class="message sent">Definitely, let's add in an extra week just to be safe.<p class=message>Perfect. So, 4 months in total?<p class="message sent">Yep, that sounds about right.<p class=message>Awesome. Hey, have you seen the new Star Wars movie yet?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. Have you?<p class=message>Yeah, I went on opening night. It was awesome!<p class="message sent">That's awesome! I still need to check it out. Maybe this weekend.<p class=message>You definitely should! It's a must-see for any Star Wars fan.<p class="message sent">I'll make sure to do that. Hey, speaking of weekends, do you have any exciting plans for this one?<p class=message>Not really, just planning on catching up on some much-needed sleep. What about you?<p class="message sent">Same here! I think I might also do a little bit of gaming.<p class=message>Nice! What game are you currently playing?<p class="message sent">I've been really into Apex Legends lately. Have you played it?<p class=message>No, not yet. I'm more of a Fortnite guy myself.<p class="message sent">Ah, no worries. Well, maybe we can team up and play some Fortnite together sometime.<p class=message>Definitely! That sounds like a plan.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9eb57ff2-2569-4a80-bd47-476fae316a84.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
