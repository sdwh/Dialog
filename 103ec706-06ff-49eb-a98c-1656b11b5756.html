What kind of drinks have you been serving up tonight?<p class="message sent">A lot of margaritas and beer mostly. What about you, any interesting cocktail requests?<p class=message>I had someone ask for a Long Island Iced Tea, which was a bit surprising considering it's past midnight.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's definitely a strong choice! Speaking of surprises, have you tried any of the new appetizers yet?<p class=message>Yes, I had the loaded tots earlier and they were amazing.<p class="message sent">Nice! I've been meaning to try the truffle fries myself.<p class=message>You definitely should, they have this delicious garlic aioli dip too. Makes it even better.<p class="message sent">That sounds incredible. So, have you heard about the new band playing next weekend?<p class=message>No, what genre are they?<p class="message sent">They're a country rock band from Austin, should be a good turnout.<p class=message>Well, you know I love me some country music. I'll definitely be here for that.<p class="message sent">Awesome, can't wait to see you here. Want me to mix you up another drink in the meantime?<p class=message>Sure thing, surprise me. As long as it's not another Long Island, I think I'll be good.<p class="message sent">Haha, I won't do that to you again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=103ec4b9-8411-49b0-87f3-ebeb2c2fe1d1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
