I'm a little lost about my connecting flight. Can you help me out, please?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'm happy to assist you. Where are you flying from and where is your final destination?<p class=message>I'm coming from Bangkok and my final stop is San Francisco. But I have a layover in Tokyo.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me check your itinerary. You have an hour and a half layover. That should be plenty of time. Have you checked in your luggage all the way through to San Francisco?<p class=message>Yes, I did. But I'm still a bit anxious about making it to my next flight.<p class="message sent">No worries! The airline has a shuttle service that will take you directly to the correct gate. And if you have time, you can check out some shops and grab a bite to eat in between.<p class=message>That sounds great! Thank you so much for the information. Do you know of any must-see attractions in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Oh, there are so many! But if you have limited time, you might want to check out the Senso-ji Temple or the Tokyo Tower.<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestions! I'm definitely going to try to fit that in my trip.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask. And have a safe and enjoyable flight!<p class=message>Thank you so much for your help! I really appreciate it.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1e2d70d4-9381-4bbd-aa55-8e8561b19a45.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
