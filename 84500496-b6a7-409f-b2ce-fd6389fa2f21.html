How's business at the fruit stand today?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too! It's been quite busy so far. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain, people seem to love my pancakes. Say, what's that fruit you have there?<p class="message sent">Oh, this is dragon fruit. It's one of our local specialties. Would you like to try some?<p class=message>Sure, why not? Here you go, have a taste of my pancake too.<p class="message sent">Mmm, this pancake is divine! What's your secret ingredient?<p class=message>Well, a good pancake needs a bit of love, some flour, eggs, sugar and milk.<p class="message sent">You're right, it sure tastes like love. It pairs perfectly with this dragon fruit.<p class=message>Dragon fruit is a little bland to me, but I suppose that's just my taste. Do you have any other fruits that go well with my pancakes?<p class="message sent">Of course! We have a wide selection of tropical fruits like mangoes, papayas, pineapples, and more.<p class=message>That sounds tempting. Maybe we should team up and create a fruit pancake combo?<p class="message sent">I think that's a great idea! It'll be the perfect fusion of Chinese and Western flavors.<p class=message>Alright then, let's make it official. We're team Pancake and Fruit Combo!<p class="message sent">I'm in! I'm looking forward to seeing what we come up with.<p class=message>Me too. I think we're going to “fruitfully” enhance each other's businesses.<p class="message sent">Ha! You crack me up. Let's get to work then, partner.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. We'll be the talk of Yaowarat in no time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=844c07b4-ea62-4c3a-ac5a-ead68f042f8c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
