Do you have any experience with this?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have some experience with it. What kind of licenses do we need?<p class=message>Well, we need licenses for our dev, test, and production environments. Do you have any idea how many we should get?<p class="message sent">It depends on how many servers we have and how many cores each server has. I suggest we calculate the core count and consult with Microsoft to determine the right license type.<p class=message>That sounds reasonable. Do you know how much it'll cost?<p class="message sent">It's hard to say without knowing the exact license type and the number of cores. But, it can be quite expensive, so we need to be careful.<p class=message>Yeah, I definitely don't want to blow our budget on licenses. Maybe we should also consider open-source alternatives.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. But, we should also weigh the pros and cons of open-source vs proprietary software.<p class=message>Absolutely. And, we'll need to make sure that the open-source software we choose is compatible with our existing systems.<p class="message sent">Yes, compatibility is important. Have you looked into any open-source alternatives?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'll start doing some research. Thank you for the suggestion.<p class="message sent">No problem. By the way, have you ever tried SQL Server on Linux?<p class=message>No, I didn't realize it was even available on Linux. Have you tried it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have, and it's working great. It's worth considering as an option.<p class=message>Interesting. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the heads up.<p class="message sent">Anytime. Let me know if you have any other questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b9051b73-6b32-4a6b-9ca1-6333f7691dae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
