I'm glad we get to work together on our ISO 27001 audit. How are you feeling about it?<p class="message sent">Hey, I'm doing alright. I think we're ready to tackle this! Have you ever done an audit like this before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's important for us to ensure that all security measures are in place and that we protect sensitive data.<p class="message sent">Definitely! I'm looking forward to learning more about the process. So, what do we need to start with?<p class=message>Let's first assess our access controls. Can you tell me who has access to our systems?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! We have a list of authorized personnel who can access various parts of the system.<p class=message>Great! And have all employees gone through the necessary security training?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have an annual security training that all employees are required to complete. We take security seriously here!<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear. Let's move on to physical security. Are all server rooms and data centers secure?<p class="message sent">Yes, they are. We have security cameras, access controls, and personnel monitoring them.<p class=message>Perfect. Let's also check that data backups are being done and that the data is encrypted during transmission.<p class="message sent">Yes, we have redundant backups and encryption protocols in place.<p class=message>Wow, you guys really have it together. I'm impressed!<p class="message sent">Thank you, we try our best. Hey, if we finish this audit in record time, want to go out for some celebratory drinks?<p class=message>Ha! That sounds like a great idea. I think we can definitely accomplish that.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ea7c87a-4596-4319-a57f-f45b17fe9186.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
