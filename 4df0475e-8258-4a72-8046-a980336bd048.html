How's business today?<p class="message sent">Hi A! It's been great! The heat seems to be driving people to buy more ice cream.<p class=message>I know what you mean. Our hot dogs are also flying off the shelves. Speaking of which, have you tried one of our chili cheese dogs?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard great things about them. Mind if I grab one for my lunch break?<p class=message>Of course not! And I was just about to ask if you could whip up a couple of your famous shaved ice cups for me and my staff.<p class="message sent">You got it! I have some new flavors that I bet you'll love. Have you ever tried mango or green tea ice?<p class=message>I haven't, but they sound delicious. I trust your judgement, so surprise me!<p class="message sent">Ooh, I love surprises! Let me get started on those shaved ice cups while you grab that chili cheese dog.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Hey, B, have you ever thought about branching out and opening up your own ice cream or shaved ice shop?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. But I can't imagine leaving this prime location! Plus, I enjoy our little partnership too much.<p class=message>I know what you mean. We make quite the dynamic duo. Alright, here's your chili cheese dog, and can't wait to try those shaved ice cups!<p class="message sent">Here you go! I've got strawberry and green tea shaved ice with condensed milk and mochi balls, and mango shaved ice with fresh mango chunks and coconut cream.<p class=message>Wow, you went all out! These are amazing, B. I think we should start advertising our combo deals with your shaved ice cups and our hot dogs.<p class="message sent">Great idea! We'll have everyone lining up in no time.<p class=message>That's the spirit. And hey, maybe someday we'll have a whole street of food and drink vendors working together like us.<p class="message sent">I like the way you think, A. Who knows what the future holds?<p class=message>Indeed. Alright, let's get back to serving these happy customers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4dec2df1-243c-4aec-b06e-e08dce0ed995.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
