I'm sure you've seen all kinds of cases during your time here.<p class=message>Yes, that's true. Every day is different and challenging, but it's also very rewarding to help people feel better.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. What do you enjoy doing outside of work, doctor?<p class=message>I enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors. It's a great way to unwind and recharge my batteries after a long work week.<p class="message sent">That sounds fun.

Fresh air and exercise are great for both physical and mental health.<p class="message sent">Thank you for your help and advice, doctor. I appreciate it.<p class=message>You're welcome.
