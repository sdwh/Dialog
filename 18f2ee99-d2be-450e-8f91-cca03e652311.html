Nice to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you too, A. So, what brings you to our organization?<p class=message>As part of our auditing process, we've chosen your organization to evaluate compliance with the ISO 27001 standard.<p class="message sent">Well, we've been expecting you.

So, how's your experience with the ISO 27001 standard so far?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, implementing the standard has allowed us to prioritize security and risk management.<p class=message>That's great to hear.
