Is there a problem?<p class="message sent">Good morning sir. Yes, there is a road sign up ahead that says "No U-Turn". Did you see it?<p class=message>Oh, I'm sorry. I must have missed it. I was too busy listening to my favorite radio station.<p class="message sent">It's important to pay attention to road signs sir, especially when it comes to safety.<p class=message>Yes, you're right officer. Safety is always a top priority. I'll make sure to keep my eyes on the road.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear sir. I understand that U-turns can be tempting, but please remember to follow the signs and keep the road safe for everyone.<p class=message>Definitely officer. I'll make sure to plan my route better next time.<p class="message sent">That's a wise decision sir. Now, I'll have to issue a warning for this violation. Please be more careful in the future.<p class=message>Thank you officer. I appreciate the reminder. I don't want to endanger anyone's life on the road.<p class="message sent">That's exactly the right attitude sir. Let's work together to make the roads a safer place for everyone.<p class=message>Absolutely officer. I'll do my part in making that happen.<p class="message sent">Great to hear sir.
