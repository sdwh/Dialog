What is it?<p class=message>It's a Canadian dish. It's french fries, cheese curds, and gravy. It's absolutely delicious!<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Is it easy to make?<p class=message>It's actually very simple. Just fry some potatoes, add cheese curds, and then pour gravy on top.<p class="message sent">Hmm, it doesn't sound like the healthiest meal.<p class=message>Yeah, it's definitely not the healthiest. But it's worth indulging in every once in a while.<p class="message sent">I'll have to give it a try sometime. Do you have a favorite place to get Poutine?<p class=message>There's a food truck near my work that makes amazing Poutine. You should come with me for lunch one day.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a plan. Maybe we can split a large order so we don't feel too guilty!<p class=message>That's a great idea! I'm always down for trying new foods.<p class="message sent">Same here. I think it's fun to explore new cuisines and dishes.<p class=message>Absolutely! There's so much out there to try. Poutine is just the beginning.<p class="message sent">Do you have any other recommendations for Canadian dishes?<p class=message>Yes, you should try Tourti√®re. It's a meat pie filled with pork or beef, and it's a holiday tradition in Quebec.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. I'll have to add it to my list.<p class=message>Definitely! We'll have to plan a Canadian cuisine day and try all sorts of dishes.<p class="message sent">That sounds like so much fun. I can't wait!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4177eb79-e653-4b7b-973b-f85d0458b865.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
