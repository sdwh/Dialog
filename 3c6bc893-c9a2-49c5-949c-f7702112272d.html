I'm doing great, thank you for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm excited for this trip to Hiroshima, it's my first time here.

It's a local specialty.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! Do you have a favorite place to get Okonomiyaki?<p class="message sent">There's a great restaurant called Okonomimura in the city center. It has over 20 stalls selling different versions of Okonomiyaki.<p class=message>Wow, that's a lot of options.

It's a beautiful historic castle with a great view of the city.<p class=message>Sounds like a great way to spend an afternoon. Thanks for all the recommendations, driver.
