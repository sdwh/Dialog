I'm the software engineer for this company.<p class=message>Great, let's get started. Have you guys done any previous ISO 27001 audits?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, we've done them before. I think we're fairly familiar with the process.<p class=message>That's good to hear. So, let's begin with the first checkpoint. How do you guys manage access control?<p class="message sent">Well, we use a combination of role-based access and two-factor authentication to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.<p class=message>Sounds like a solid approach. Now, I have to ask, do you guys have a policy for BYOD, or 'Bring Your Own Device'?<p class="message sent">Yep, we do. Employees are allowed to use their own devices, but they have to sign a waiver and agree to some security measures first.<p class=message>Excellent, it's good to see you guys taking security seriously. On a lighter note, what's the funniest security incident you've ever encountered?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Oh man, I once caught a co-worker trying to use 'password' as their actual password. Needless to say, we had a chat about better security practices.<p class=message>Ha! That's too funny. Well, I'm pleased to report that your security measures seem to be in good shape, and you guys have passed the audit. Thanks for a great audit experience!<p class="message sent">Thank you, it was really informative. Glad we passed!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=857ec87d-78e1-4c36-8ba9-7823b94ff792.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
