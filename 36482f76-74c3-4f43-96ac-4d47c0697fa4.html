I'm a tea merchant from Guangdong. Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm the owner of this tea house in Meizhou. Glad to have you here.<p class=message>The reputation of Meizhou tea precedes itself. I've come to sample some of the local flavors.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We have a wide variety of teas to try. Would you like to start with some oolong tea?<p class=message>Sure thing. And maybe we could move onto some green teas afterwards?<p class="message sent">Of course. Let me bring out some of our premium oolong tea for you to try.<p class=message>Mmm, this has a nice subtle flavor. It's very smooth.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it.

Do you have any other teas you'd like to recommend?<p class="message sent">Actually, we have a rare black tea that's only made in Meizhou. It's called Meizhan and it has an incredible complexity of flavor.<p class=message>I'd love to try it! Let's have a cup.<p class="message sent">Great choice.
