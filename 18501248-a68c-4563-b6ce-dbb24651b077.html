I'm Farmer A.<p class="message sent">Hi Farmer A, I'm Dr. B, the veterinarian you called for the health check-up of your livestock.<p class=message>Yes, I'm glad you're here. I want to make sure my cows and goats are healthy and happy.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Can you show me around your livestock area and tell me about their diet and habits?<p class=message>Sure thing. Our cows mainly graze on the grass in the pasture, and we supplement their diet with hay and corn silage. Our goats like to eat leaves, twigs, and grass. They also love to play and climb.<p class="message sent">Sounds like they have a pretty good life here. Let's start the check-up. First, let's check their heart and respiration rates.<p class=message>Alright, let me help you catch them. Some of them might be a bit stubborn.<p class="message sent">No problem, I'm used to it. This little guy is certainly feisty.<p class=message>(laughs) Yes, he always gives us a hard time. But we love him nonetheless.<p class="message sent">(smiling) That's the spirit. They're all looking good so far. Now, let's check their teeth and eyes.<p class=message>Okay, I'll hold them steady for you. You're really good at this, Dr. B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, it's my passion to make sure animals are healthy. They're all in great shape, but I recommend some vitamins and minerals to boost their immune system.<p class=message>Thank you for your advice. We'll make sure to follow your recommendations.<p class="message sent">It was a pleasure checking your livestock. Don't hesitate to call me anytime if you need help.<p class=message>Thank you again, Dr. B. We really appreciate your expertise.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, Farmer A. Take care of your animals, they're lucky to have such a caring owner.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=184fa2e5-6dc7-4843-a6f9-80109f2539d6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
