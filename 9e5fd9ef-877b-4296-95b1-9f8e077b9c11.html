We could also expand our test cases to include more edge cases and negative scenarios.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We should also try to involve the developers more in the testing process, to ensure that we catch any bugs early on.<p class=message>True, but we also need to make sure that our testing is not too reliant on just one person or team. We should have a team approach to testing.<p class="message sent">Yes, and that includes utilizing tools and technologies that can help us in the testing process, like virtualization or cloud-based testing.<p class=message>And of course, we can't forget about constantly reviewing and updating our test cases to ensure that we are covering all possible scenarios.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We might even want to consider using crowd testing to get a wider range of feedback and insights.<p class=message>That's an interesting suggestion. We should definitely keep all our options open as we work towards achieving full test coverage.<p class="message sent">Agreed. With a thorough and collaborative approach, we can ensure that our software is of the highest quality and meets the needs of our clients.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e5e0324-d6ba-4ac1-b72e-156bafffadf2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
