How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not bad, A. What's on your mind?<p class=message>I've been thinking about how to keep the personal data of our students and faculty secure. Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. One of the best ways is to use encryption technology. That way, even if someone hacks into the system, the data will be protected.<p class=message>Good point. But what about our network? How can we keep it secure?<p class="message sent">We need to make sure that all devices accessing the network are properly secured. That includes using strong passwords and keeping software up-to-date.<p class=message>Got it. And what if an attacker does manage to get in? How can we detect and respond to threats?<p class="message sent">We need to have a good security monitoring system in place. That way, we can detect unusual activity and take action before it's too late.<p class=message>That makes sense. But how can we get everyone on board with good security practices?<p class="message sent">We need to educate everyone about the risks and the best practices. We could have training sessions and even run simulations to show people what could happen if security is breached.<p class=message>That's a great idea. And what about physical security? How can we protect against theft or loss of devices?<p class="message sent">We can use tracking software to locate stolen devices. And we need to make sure that all sensitive data is stored securely and backed up regularly.<p class=message>Perfect. Thanks for all these great tips, B. I feel a lot more confident about our security now.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Protecting personal data is everyone's responsibility.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f271d8e9-95a9-4dca-a3d7-914490fa3e37.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
