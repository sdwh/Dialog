How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm fantastic, thanks. Have you had a chance to try the new coffee beans we got in?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I can already smell the aroma. Can I have a cup of coffee, please?<p class=message>Sure thing. Do you want the classic French blend or something more adventurous?<p class="message sent">Let's go with the classic French blend for now.<p class=message>Great choice. One classic French coffee coming right up. *starts making coffee*<p class="message sent">Wow, this bread you made is amazing! It's so crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.<p class=message>Thank you! Freshly baked in the oven every morning.<p class="message sent">Do you have any new bread varieties you're working on?<p class=message>We're experimenting with a gluten-free baguette. It's proving to be quite challenging, but I'm determined to get it right.<p class="message sent">That would be fantastic. There's a growing demand for gluten-free products in the market.<p class=message>Definitely. And speaking of market demand, have you noticed an increase in coffee orders lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. I think people are starting to appreciate the art of coffee making and the unique flavors different blends can offer.<p class=message>I completely agree. It's quite fascinating to see how coffee has evolved over the years.<p class="message sent">And bread as well. Who would've thought that sourdough would become such a popular trend?<p class=message>It's amazing how food trends come and go. But as long as we continue to provide quality and consistent products, I'm sure we'll always have customers.<p class="message sent">That's for sure. *takes a sip of coffee* This is great, A. Thanks for the delicious cup of coffee.<p class=message>You're welcome, B. And thanks for the compliment on the bread. It's great to work with a partner who appreciates good food as much as I do.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3b1a0854-157c-42a6-b7da-c4c610e4662b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
