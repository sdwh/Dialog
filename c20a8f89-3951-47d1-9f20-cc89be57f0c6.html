But I'm glad it's over now. How about you?<p class=message>It was alright. Just trying to keep up with all the work. But I'm really looking forward to this meal now. This restaurant has amazing reviews.<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been here before actually. The food is definitely worth it.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I don't know what to order though. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Well, I highly recommend the steak. It's cooked to perfection every time.<p class=message>Hmm, that does sound good. And what about the sides?<p class="message sent">The mashed potatoes are amazing. They're so creamy and flavorful.<p class=message>Okay, I'll go for that then. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class="message sent">No problem. And what about drinks? Would you like a beer or maybe a cocktail?<p class=message>Actually, I'll just stick to water for now. Gotta stay hydrated, you know?<p class="message sent">Haha, yes, very responsible of you. I think I'll have a glass of wine though. It's been a long day.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. So, what do you think of our new manager?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I think she's great. She's always so organized and efficient.<p class=message>Yeah, I agree. Plus, she's always willing to listen to our ideas and concerns.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And she's been doing a great job with keeping morale up during these challenging times.<p class=message>True. I'm really grateful to have her as our manager.<p class="message sent">Me too. And here's our food! Enjoy, boss.<p class=message>Thanks, let's dig in!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c2083935-fb10-42cf-9e9e-315f00f44f22.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
