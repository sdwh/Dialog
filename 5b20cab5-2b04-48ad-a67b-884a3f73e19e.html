Our clients are freaking out and our team is working around the clock to resolve the issue.<p class=message>I hear you. It's so important that we come up with a solid plan to prevent and mitigate these attacks.<p class="message sent">Agreed. One thing we can do is implement a DDoS protection service that can help absorb the attack traffic before it reaches our clients' websites.<p class=message>Yes, that's a good idea. We can also use traffic filtering to block traffic from suspicious sources.<p class="message sent">Another important step is to make sure our clients' security software is up to date and properly configured.<p class=message>Definitely. And we should also work with our clients to create a response plan in case of future attacks.<p class="message sent">That's a great point. It's important for our clients to be prepared and have a clear understanding of what steps to take if they're targeted.<p class=message>I also think it would be helpful to educate our clients on the different types of DDoS attacks so they better understand the risks and how we're protecting them.<p class="message sent">Education is key. The more informed our clients are, the better they can protect themselves against attacks.<p class=message>Absolutely. It feels good to know we're doing everything we can to keep our clients safe from these attacks.<p class="message sent">It does. And with our team's expertise, I have no doubt we can continue to stay ahead of the curve and keep our clients protected.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5b119a5c-5fa6-4a45-a1dc-af9035a65d85.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
