How's it going with the software development?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Glad you asked. We've been making good progress and have even implemented some new security measures to comply with ISO 27001.<p class=message>Oh, that's great to hear! As the lead auditor, I'm keen on ensuring compliance. Would you mind telling me more about the security measures you put in place?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. One of the measures is the use of two-factor authentication across all our systems. We've also implemented intrusion detection, which alerts us of any unauthorized access attempts.<p class=message>Impressive! You're definitely going the extra mile in protecting your systems. Is there anything else you're working on?<p class="message sent">Well, we've also started testing for vulnerabilities in our software and promptly patching them. We don't want to leave any loopholes that could be exploited.<p class=message>That's fantastic. It's not just about ticking the boxes for compliance reasons but really making sure your systems are secure. I'm glad to see such dedication from you and your team.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. We take security seriously and understand the importance of ISO 27001 compliance.<p class=message>Speaking of taking things seriously, do you have any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm planning to take a break from coding and try out a new recipe I found online. What about you, A?<p class=message>I plan to visit the local zoo with my family. I heard they have new baby animals, and my kids are excited to see them.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a fun plan. Make sure you take lots of pictures and share them with us on Monday!<p class=message>Will do, B. Have a great weekend!<p class="message sent">You too, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1e9cb5d8-ed29-41df-96dc-05f2ac689d68.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
