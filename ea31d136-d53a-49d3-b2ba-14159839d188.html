How many would you like?<p class=message>Actually, could I have two extra? I always like to have a lot of pillows on long flights.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Anything to make your flight more comfortable! Would you like me to bring them to you now?<p class=message>That would be great, thank you so much!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Is there anything else I can get for you to make your flight even better?<p class=message>Hmm, let me think. Do you have any stories to tell?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well, I do have a funny story about a passenger who wore their seatbelt as a fashion accessory.<p class=message>(laughs) That sounds hilarious, please do tell!<p class="message sent">So this passenger boarded the plane and buckled their seatbelt, but then they didn't unfasten it even after we took off. We kept reminding them, but they said they liked how it looked as a belt. (both laugh)<p class=message>Oh my goodness, that's too funny. Thank you for sharing that story with me. You've made my flight even better!<p class="message sent">I'm so happy to hear that! Enjoy your extra pillows and let me know if you need anything else.<p class=message>Will do, thank you again!<p class="message sent">My pleasure.
