The views there are absolutely stunning.<p class=message>Those places sound amazing. I've heard about the famous Kyoto cuisine. What's your favorite dish?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of Okonomiyaki, which is a savory pancake with various ingredients. It's popular in Osaka, but you can find it in Kyoto too.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll have to try it. Speaking of food, have you heard of the Kyoto-style sushi?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's different from regular sushi because it uses vinegar that's aged for several years. It's a must-try for sushi lovers.<p class=message>That sounds intriguing. I'll make sure to add it to my list. Thank you for your recommendations.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. I hope you enjoy your trip to Kyoto. It's a beautiful city that I'm sure you'll love.<p class=message>I'm sure I will. I'm excited to see what the city has to offer.
