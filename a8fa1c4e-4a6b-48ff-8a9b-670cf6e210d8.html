Did you get a chance to look at the results from the vulnerability scan we ran last week?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did. It looks like we have some work to do. There were quite a few critical and high severity vulnerabilities that were found.<p class=message>Oh no! That's not good. Did the scan provide any suggestions on how we can fix these issues?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it did. Some of them were pretty straightforward to fix, while others are going to take some time and effort. But we'll get it done. We always do.<p class=message>That's the spirit. We don't want any hackers getting into our system, do we?<p class="message sent">Absolutely not! I'm glad we caught these issues before it was too late. Did you know that the majority of successful cyber attacks are due to unpatched vulnerabilities?<p class=message>Yes, I did. It's always better to be proactive than reactive when it comes to security.<p class="message sent">That's right. And speaking of being proactive, have you seen any good movies or TV shows lately?<p class=message>Haha, nice segue. Yes, I actually just finished watching Stranger Things on Netflix. It was really good.<p class="message sent">Oh cool, I've heard good things about that show. I've been re-watching The Office. It's a classic.<p class=message>You can never go wrong with The Office. Anyway, back to the vulnerabilities, do you think we should schedule a time to start patching these issues?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Let's coordinate with the other teams and set a date for when we can start the remediation process.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Thanks for your help, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a8f9ccbb-8dbb-4216-ad2e-2f7e983b830f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
