It's a security management system standard. But why do you wanna talk about it?<p class=message>I'm just curious, you know? I read somewhere that it's essential for businesses to protect their data and information.<p class="message sent">Definitely! ISO 27001 ensures that organizations implement security controls to manage and protect their sensitive data.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds technical. But why did they call it ISO 27001?<p class="message sent">I think itâ€™s just the standard's number in the ISO catalogue.<p class=message>Ah, that makes sense. But, I mean, who comes up with these standards? Do they have a sense of humor?<p class="message sent">That's a good question. I'm not sure if they're known for their humor, but they do have a serious approach to security management.<p class=message>Hmm, right. But do you think implementing ISO 27001 Security Policy will help us become more secure?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's an international standard, so it has a proven track record of improving security practices.<p class=message>That's awesome to know. But tell me, do you think our office's coffee machine needs security controls too?<p class="message sent">Ha-ha! Well, the coffee might not be that sensitive, but I think we should apply security measures for our office WiFi, to prevent hackers from accessing our network.<p class=message>That's true. I'll make sure to use a stronger password for our WiFi connection. Thanks for the tip!<p class="message sent">No problem! It's always better to be safe than sorry.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ccc260e9-2f78-440b-9feb-731ad4b7ed18.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
