I think it would pair perfectly with the grilled swordfish on the menu tonight.<p class="message sent">Sounds great. Speaking of the menu, have you tried our new dish, the seared scallops with roasted garlic butter?<p class=message>Yes, I had it last night. It was amazing. The garlic butter really elevated the flavors of the scallops.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that. I put a lot of effort into perfecting that dish.<p class=message>You know, we both have pretty cool jobs. You get to create amazing dishes, and I get to help people discover new and delicious wines.<p class="message sent">True. But sometimes I envy you. I mean, I get so busy in the kitchen that I don't have time to interact with the customers much.<p class=message>Don't worry. That's where I come in. I always make sure to suggest some great wine pairings and chat with our guests.<p class="message sent">You're a lifesaver. Hey, did you hear about that new food festival coming up next month? We should totally check it out and get some inspiration for new dishes.<p class=message>That's a great idea! And maybe we can even find some new wines to add to our selection.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's always exciting to try something new and see how our customers react.<p class=message>Speaking of exciting, did you catch the game last night?<p class="message sent">No, I was too busy working. Who won?<p class=message>The Rockets did! It was a close game, but James Harden really stepped up in the final quarter.<p class="message sent">Nice! I'll have to catch the highlights later.<p class=message>For sure. Hey, it looks like we've got some customers waiting for us. Time to get back to work.<p class="message sent">Yep, let's do it. See you later, A.<p class=message>See you, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=182b2d4d-6ffd-4619-b404-a1bc6c760d58.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
