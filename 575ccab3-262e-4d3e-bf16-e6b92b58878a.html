But it's legal now, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, the ban was lifted in the 1990s. It's still quite controversial though.<p class=message>So how do you make an Absinthe?<p class="message sent">It's traditional to use a sugar cube, which we place on a slotted spoon over the Absinthe, and then we slowly pour water over it to dilute it.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. Can I watch you make it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's quite a show. *starts preparing the Absinthe*<p class=message>Wow, that's pretty cool. It's like a mini science experiment.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's all about technique and precision. It takes a lot of practice.<p class=message>Well, it looks like you've got it down. *takes a sip* This is amazing!<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it! It's our specialty here.<p class=message>I can see why. So, what other famous Swiss alcoholic drinks do you have here?<p class="message sent">We have plenty! How about a Swiss Martini, or a Swiss Chocolate Liqueur?<p class=message>The Swiss Chocolate Liqueur sounds delicious. I think I'll have to try that next.<p class="message sent">Good choice. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=575b6dab-f42a-4e44-8c32-4a2caa5a829d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
