What's on the menu for today?<p class="message sent">Morning, A! We have BBQ ribs, grilled chicken, and baked potatoes with all the fixings.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds delicious! I can see the customers are already lining up.<p class="message sent">Yes, we're quite popular here in Austin. But we have to be careful with food safety and hygiene. Can you remind the staff to wash their hands regularly?<p class=message>No problem, I'll make sure to do that. By the way, have you tried the new recipe for our mac and cheese?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. It's amazing! I love the combination of cheeses and breadcrumbs on top.<p class=message>Glad you like it! I spent hours tweaking the recipe to make it just right.<p class="message sent">Speaking of recipes, we have a customer requesting a gluten-free option. Can you come up with something?<p class=message>Absolutely! How about a quinoa salad with grilled vegetables and a honey-mustard dressing?<p class="message sent">Perfect! You always come up with the best ideas, A.<p class=message>Thanks, B! It's all about making sure everyone can enjoy our food. Hey, I have an idea! How about we have a cook-off between the staff for the best BBQ sauce?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! We can have the customers vote on their favorite. Winner gets a day off!<p class=message>Haha, I like the sound of that. Let's start planning it now.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. And let's make sure to spread the word on social media too. We may even attract some new customers.<p class=message>Excellent point, B. This is going to be a fun and tasty event.<p class="message sent">I agree, A. Let's get cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c1a07ef9-d4f0-4a25-ac44-016305e1059c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
