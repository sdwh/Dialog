How long have you been driving taxis?<p class="message sent">Hello, sir! I've been driving taxis for over 10 years now. It's been quite a journey.<p class=message>That's great! Do you have any interesting stories or experiences to share?<p class="message sent">Well, one time, I had a passenger who left his phone in the car. When I tried to return it, he had already boarded a plane back to his home country. I had to mail it to him overseas!<p class=message>Wow, that's going above and beyond! So, what's the most beautiful place you've ever driven to?<p class="message sent">I would have to say the countryside in Italy. The rolling hills and vineyards were breathtaking.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. Have you ever been to Moscow before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's a beautiful city with a lot of history and culture.<p class=message>I'm excited to see it. Do you have any recommendations on what to see or do?<p class="message sent">Definitely visit the Red Square and the Kremlin. And make sure to try some traditional Russian cuisine!<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. So, do you enjoy listening to music while driving?<p class="message sent">Of course! I love listening to classic rock and roll. It helps keep me energized during long drives.<p class=message>That's awesome. Do you have a favorite band or musician?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm a big fan of The Beatles. Their music never gets old.<p class=message>I completely agree! Well, thank you for the pleasant conversation and safe driving.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, sir. It was my pleasure. Have a great time in Moscow!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e32aa2ac-fadc-43be-a952-87794936af3b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
