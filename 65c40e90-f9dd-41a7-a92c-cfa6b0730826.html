I'm A, the lead auditor for this ISO 27001 audit. Nice to meet you, B, the network engineer.<p class="message sent">Hi A! Nice to meet you too. Excited to have you here today for the audit.<p class=message>Thanks, B. Before we start, I have a question. Is your network up and running?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. Why do you ask?<p class=message>Just wanted to know so that we can ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information in line with ISO 27001.<p class="message sent">Great point, A! Speaking of confidentiality, have you heard that one about the password that got changed to "incorrect"?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What happened?<p class="message sent">Every time someone tried to log in with the wrong password, the system would say, "Your password is incorrect."<p class=message>Hahaha, that's hilarious. Speaking of passwords, are all your systems password-protected?<p class="message sent">Yes, they are. We also make sure to enforce strong password policies for our users.<p class=message>Sounds good. I'm impressed by your commitment to information security. By the way, do you know why hackers prefer chess players as targets?<p class="message sent">I have no idea. Why do they?<p class=message>Because they know how to protect their kings.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's a good one. But seriously, we take security very seriously here.<p class=message>I can tell, B. That's why I'm positive this audit will go smoothly. And hey, maybe after this we can play a game of chess.<p class="message sent">Sure, why not? But be warned, I'm pretty competitive.<p class=message>Same here, B. Let's see who comes out on top.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=65c1f8d5-7147-4e00-ae80-3d7eee380f08.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
