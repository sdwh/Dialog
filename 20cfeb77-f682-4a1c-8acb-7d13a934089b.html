Are we all set for the dinner rush tonight?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! Yes, we're ready to take on the hungry crowd. What dish are you serving up tonight?<p class=message>I have a special grilled salmon with a lemon butter sauce on the menu today. I guarantee it's going to be a hit with our customers.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! I'll make sure to recommend it to our guests. By the way, did you hear about the new pastry chef we hired?<p class=message>No, I didn't. Who is it?<p class="message sent">Her name is Sarah and she's been making some amazing desserts. I think you should try her chocolate cake after your shift.<p class=message>You know me too well, B! I can never say no to a good chocolate cake. Speaking of desserts, did you see that guy at Table 5 trying to sneak off without paying his bill?<p class="message sent">Oh no, really? I'll go check it out and make sure he pays up. Thanks for letting me know!<p class=message>No problem. That's what team-work is all about, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And speaking of teams, have you been keeping up with the latest football scores?<p class=message>I have! My team won their last game, and I'm really hoping they make it to the finals this year.<p class="message sent">That's great news! I'm rooting for them too. By the way, did you hear about the new cocktail on our drink menu?<p class=message>No, what's in it?<p class="message sent">It's called "The Sunset", and it's made with vodka, orange juice, and grenadine. I tried it last night, and it's a real crowd-pleaser.<p class=message>That sounds refreshing. I think I'll try it out after my shift tonight. Thanks for letting me know, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. Let's get ready for a busy night ahead of us!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=20c96dec-70fd-4900-8b5e-22d4ace810e4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
