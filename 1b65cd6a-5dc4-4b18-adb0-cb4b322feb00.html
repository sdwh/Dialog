It looks like we have some work to do.<p class=message>Definitely. It's always better to take care of the vulnerabilities before the attackers find them.<p class="message sent">I totally agree. So, which one stood out to you the most?<p class=message>Hmm, I would say the one where we still have default credentials for one of our database servers.<p class="message sent">Oh no, that's bad. We should have changed that a long time ago.<p class=message>I know, but better late than never. I think we should change it ASAP.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we should. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class=message>Well, the scan also showed that some of our software versions are outdated. We should update them too.<p class="message sent">Okay. I'll work on that. Anything else?<p class=message>Actually, there's one more. It seems that we have an unsecured port on a firewall.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's not good. Thanks for bringing that up. I'll make sure to fix it.<p class=message>No problem. Remember to keep track of our vulnerability management plan too.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Caring for our security is a team effort. Timing is everything.<p class=message>Agreed. Have a great day, B.<p class="message sent">You too, A. Let's make sure our system is always safe and secure.
