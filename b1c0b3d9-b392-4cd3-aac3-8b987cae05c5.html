It's crazy how these attacks are becoming more frequent.<p class=message>I know, right? We need to come up with a plan on how to handle DDoS attacks.<p class="message sent">That's right. One approach we can take is to identify and block the source of the attack.<p class=message>That sounds good. Do you have any ideas on how we can do that more efficiently?<p class="message sent">Well, we can use automated tools for blocking or filtering traffic that meets certain criteria. We can also use firewalls and intrusion prevention systems.<p class=message>Hmm, interesting. But how do we ensure that we don't block legitimate traffic in the process?<p class="message sent">We can configure our filters and rules to allow traffic from known, trusted sources. It's also important to monitor traffic and make adjustments as needed.<p class=message>Makes sense. But what about the sleepless nights we have to spend while resolving the attack?<p class="message sent">Haha, well, that's just part of the job. But we can make things easier by having a well-documented incident response plan and regularly training our team on how to handle DDoS attacks.<p class=message>You're right. A good plan and reliable tools can make all the difference.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And on that note, I think we should schedule a training session soon.<p class=message>Great idea. Let's plan for it next week.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Thanks for the fruitful chat.<p class=message>Anytime, B. It's always cool discussing security protocols with you. See you around!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b1be78c4-120e-4695-8578-ef46ec853283.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
