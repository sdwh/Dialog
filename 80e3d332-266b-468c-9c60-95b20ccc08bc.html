Have you decided what to order?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm thinking of getting the burger. How about you?<p class=message>I'm eyeing the chicken Caesar salad. But you know what they say, bacon makes everything better.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's true. So how are things going at the office?<p class=message>Busy as usual, but we're making progress. How about you, any new projects?<p class="message sent">Yep, we just started working on a marketing campaign for a new product. It's exciting stuff.<p class=message>Nice! Speaking of new things, have you seen the new Marvel movie yet?<p class="message sent">Oh, I haven't had the chance yet. Is it good?<p class=message>It's awesome, you gotta watch it. Speaking of movies, what's your all-time favorite?<p class="message sent">That's a tough one. Maybe The Shawshank Redemption?<p class=message>Ah, classic choice. Mine's The Godfather. Can't go wrong with that.<p class="message sent">Definitely, it's a great movie. So, back to work-related stuff, how do you feel about the upcoming deadline?<p class=message>Honestly, a bit stressed, but I'm confident we'll make it on time. It's just a matter of working efficiently.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Well, speaking of efficiency, our meals are here. Looks delicious.<p class=message>Let's dig in.
