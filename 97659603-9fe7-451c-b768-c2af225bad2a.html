May I help you with anything?<p class="message sent">Hi, yes please. Could you recommend any local specialties on the menu?<p class=message>Certainly, we have our popular fish and chips which is a must-try for seafood lovers. The roast beef and Yorkshire pudding is also a local favorite.<p class="message sent">Hmm, both sound delicious. I think I'll go for the fish and chips. Can I also have a glass of white wine, please?<p class=message>Excellent choice! Do you prefer a particular type of white wine? We have a variety of options from our local vineyard.<p class="message sent">I'm not a wine connoisseur, just give me your best recommendation.<p class=message>Sure thing, I'd recommend our Chardonnay. It's a crisp and refreshing white wine with a subtle fruity aroma.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll trust your recommendation. How long does it usually take for the food to arrive?<p class=message>It usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes for the fish and chips. Would you like some bread and butter to start with while you wait?<p class="message sent">That sounds lovely, thank you. And how about dessert? Anything you'd recommend?<p class=message>Our apple crumble with vanilla ice cream or our chocolate fudge cake are very popular choices. If you're feeling adventurous, we also have a rhubarb and custard tart.<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough decision. Let me think about it while I enjoy my meal. Thank you for your help.<p class=message>You're very welcome. Enjoy your meal and please let me know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9761372b-6485-4474-950f-41b637d1d250.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
