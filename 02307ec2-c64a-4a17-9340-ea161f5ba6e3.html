How was your weekend?<p class="message sent message-content">Good morning, Doctor A! It was great. I went to the beach with my family. How about you?<p class="message received message-content">I went on a camping trip with some friends. We hiked up a mountain and saw some amazing scenery.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds like fun. So, what do we have on the schedule for today?<p class="message received message-content">A few routine check-ups in the morning, and then a patient with a possible broken wrist in the afternoon.<p class="message sent message-content">Okay, I'll make sure to have the X-ray machine ready.<p class="message received message-content">Great. Speaking of X-rays, did you hear about the skeleton who didn't go to the party?<p class="message sent message-content">No, what happened?<p class="message received message-content">He had nobody to dance with! (laughs)<p class="message sent message-content">(laughs) That's a good one. You always know how to make me smile.<p class="message received message-content">It's important to keep things light, especially when dealing with patients. Speaking of which, have you seen Mrs. Johnson's file?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I have it right here. It looks like we need to renew her prescription.<p class="message received message-content">Thanks, Nurse B. You're always so organized and efficient.<p class="message sent message-content">It's all part of the job. But I appreciate the compliment.<p class="message received message-content">That reminds me, I was thinking about taking the team out for lunch later this week. Would you be interested?<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely! Where are you thinking of going?<p class="message received message-content">How about that new Mexican restaurant down the street?<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds good to me. I'll bring my appetite.<p class="message received message-content">(laughs) Perfect. It's always more fun to eat with good company.<p class="message sent message-content">Agreed. Now, let's get to work, Doctor A.<p class="message received message-content">Right behind you, Nurse B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=022d0773-c618-4f11-afe5-e09a4f120785.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
