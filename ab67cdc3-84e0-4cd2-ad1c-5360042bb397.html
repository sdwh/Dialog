It's all about data security, right?<p class=message>Exactly! Do you know how important it is to implement this standard?<p class="message sent">Of course, it's vital for companies to protect their sensitive information.<p class=message>And not just companies, but also individuals who store their personal data online.<p class="message sent">True.

It's not just about implementing the changes, but also about making sure everyone follows them.<p class="message sent">And keeping up with regular security audits to ensure everything stays up to date.<p class=message>Yes, it's an ongoing process.
