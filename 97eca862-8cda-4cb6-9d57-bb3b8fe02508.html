How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there. I'm starving. What would you recommend?<p class=message>We have a chef's special tonight, which is a grilled salmon dish with a side of roasted vegetables.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. And is there anything else you suggest to go with that?<p class=message>Absolutely, we also have a delicious mushroom risotto which complements the salmon really well.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Can I get a glass of your house white wine too?<p class=message>Of course, I'll have that brought to your table in a moment. Are you celebrating anything special tonight?<p class="message sent">Actually yes, my friend's birthday is tomorrow so this dinner is a pre-celebration.<p class=message>Ah, that's great! We can bring out a complimentary dessert with a birthday candle for your friend.<p class="message sent">That would be amazing, thank you so much.<p class=message>Think nothing of it. We want to make your experience here a memorable one.<p class="message sent">You guys are the best. By the way, have you had anyone famous dine here before?<p class=message>Yes, we've had a few celebrities before. Just last week, we had a famous musician book the entire restaurant for his band and crew.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. Well, tonight we'll feel like a celebrity too. Thank you.<p class=message>You're welcome! Can I get you anything else while you wait for your order?<p class="message sent">Just the wine for now, thank you. And again, thank you for making this a special night for us.<p class=message>It's our pleasure. I hope you enjoy your meal and have a wonderful time at the hotel.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=97ec9026-fcf3-4454-b94b-bf129c0a77fe.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
