What do you think we should do about it?<p class=message>Well, we could start by adding a breakfast option to our menu.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! What kind of breakfast foods should we offer?<p class=message>Maybe some classic breakfast items like eggs, bacon, and toast?<p class="message sent">I like it, but I also think we should add some healthier options like yogurt and fruit.<p class=message>That's a good point. We want to make sure we cater to all dietary needs.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And what about our hours of operation? Should we start serving breakfast earlier?<p class=message>It's definitely something to consider. Maybe we could open up the breakfast service an hour earlier than usual.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. And what about our kitchen? Do we have enough resources to handle the extra cooking?<p class=message>I think so. We can always hire some additional help if needed.<p class="message sent">True. Now what about our pricing? Should we charge extra for breakfast or include it in the room rate?<p class=message>Let's include it in the room rate. That way, customers won't feel like they're being nickel-and-dimed.<p class="message sent">Good thinking. I think this breakfast service could really give us an advantage over our competitors.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's all about providing excellent customer service and going the extra mile.<p class="message sent">And as they say, breakfast is the most important meal of the day!<p class=message>Haha, you're right. Let's get to work on implementing this breakfast service ASAP.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=00f3122b-dfb8-4b59-9d13-c9c02021adad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
