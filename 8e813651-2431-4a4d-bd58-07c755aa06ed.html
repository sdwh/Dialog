It’s crazy how vulnerable some systems can be.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it’s definitely concerning. But do you think there’s anything we can do to keep our own systems safe?<p class=message>Absolutely! The key is to have multiple layers of security in place. Like, making sure you have strong passwords and two-factor authentication.<p class="message sent">Good point. And also keeping software up to date, right? I hate those pop-ups, but I know they’re important.<p class=message>Exactly. And being careful with emails too. If something seems suspicious, it’s best to just delete it.<p class="message sent">But what about phishing attacks? Those seem so sneaky.<p class=message>Yeah, they can be tough to spot. That’s why it’s important to always check the sender’s email address and hover over any links before clicking on them.<p class="message sent">Ah, that’s a good idea. And what about physical security? Like, locking up our computers when we step away from our desks?<p class=message>Definitely. And also being mindful of who we let into our workplaces. Social engineering is a real problem too.<p class="message sent">True, true. Ugh, it kind of feels overwhelming, doesn’t it?<p class=message>It can, but as long as we stay vigilant and keep implementing best practices, we should be okay.<p class="message sent">I hear ya. I think I need to go update my passwords now.<p class=message>Haha, same here. Better safe than sorry!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8e7f750a-c50a-4512-98cf-471275364b00.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
