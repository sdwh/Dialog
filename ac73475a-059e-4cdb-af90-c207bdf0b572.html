That's a common issue among college students. What do you think could help them?<p class="message sent">I was thinking about setting up a workshop or seminar on effective study habits and time management skills.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We could work with our Student Services department to plan something like that.<p class="message sent">Also, I noticed some students who seem to be struggling with stress and mental health. Do we have any resources available for them?<p class=message>Absolutely, we have counseling services and mental health resources for our students.
