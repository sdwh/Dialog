Can you recommend me something?<p class="message sent">Of course! We just received some new hats from Milan Fashion Week. Have you seen them?<p class=message>No, not yet. What styles did they bring?<p class="message sent">Well, we have some fabulous berets and fedoras that are sure to make you stand out. There's also a stunning boater hat that would be perfect for the beach.<p class=message>Hmm, I don't know if a boater hat is for me. Can you show me the fedoras?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. This black and white one is a classic, and the fabulous feather detail makes it a real statement piece.<p class=message>I love it! How much is it?<p class="message sent">It's $60, but we're running a promotion this week. You can get 20% off all hats!<p class=message>That's great news. I'll take it!<p class="message sent">Excellent choice. It will look fabulous with your outfit. Plus, it's perfect for the upcoming summer season.<p class=message>Thanks for your help. Do you have any tips for wearing a fedora?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. The key is to wear it slightly tilted to the side and make sure it doesn't overwhelm your face. You want it to enhance your look, not overpower it.<p class=message>Got it. I can't wait to wear this to my friend's wedding next weekend.<p class="message sent">You'll turn heads for sure! Thank you for choosing our store.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=18b33cf9-c566-4f4f-b05d-376755ce0159.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
