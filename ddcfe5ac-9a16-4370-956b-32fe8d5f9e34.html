I heard you're developing a new puzzle game! Can you give me a sneak peek of what it's about?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! It's called "Escape Room Quest". It's a challenging game that requires players to solve puzzles to escape the room.<p class=message>That sounds interesting! What inspired you to create this kind of game?<p class="message sent">I love escape rooms and I thought it would be fun to create a similar experience in a mobile game. Plus, I wanted to challenge players' problem-solving skills.<p class=message>So, what kind of puzzles can players expect in the game?<p class="message sent">Well, there will be a variety of puzzles, from math problems to logic puzzles. The difficulty will increase as the player progresses through the levels.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds challenging. Will there be any gimmicks in the game?<p class="message sent">Of course! There will be hidden clues and secret compartments that players will need to find in order to progress.<p class=message>That's great! When can we expect it to be released?<p class="message sent">We're aiming to release it in a few months. We're still polishing up the gameplay and making sure everything is perfect.<p class=message>I can't wait to try it out! I'm sure it will be a hit.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. We're really excited about the game and we hope players will enjoy it as much as we've enjoyed developing it.<p class=message>I'm sure they will. Good luck with the rest of the development!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I appreciate the support!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ddcd1832-abdb-4a18-8d9f-a8eebb55db1a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
