Nice to meet you, B, the tour guide for today.<p class="message sent">Hello, A. Nice to meet you too. Are you excited to explore the seafood market of Nagasaki?<p class=message>Absolutely. I've heard many good things about the fresh seafood here.<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed. Here we can find some of the best tuna, octopus, and even sea urchins.<p class=message>Wow, sounds amazing. What do you think we should get for our cooking lesson?<p class="message sent">Let's buy some tuna and shrimp so that we can make Nagasaki's famous sashimi and tempura dishes.<p class=message>Great idea! I'm also curious about the local cooking techniques. Can you show me some?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'd love to. The most popular technique here is "sutetate," which is to slice the fish against its grain to make it more tender.<p class=message>Oh, that's interesting. I'll definitely try that out. By the way, do you have any food preferences or allergies?<p class="message sent">No, I don't really have any. But I heard that you're great at cooking spicy dishes.<p class=message>That's right! How about we make a spicy tuna roll? It's a crowd favorite.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! Let's do it. Do you need any help with preparation?<p class=message>Sure, I'd appreciate that. Can you help me with the rice and seaweed?<p class="message sent">Of course! I've done this a few times before, so don't worry.<p class=message>Thank you, B. By the way, do you have any tips for making the perfect tempura batter?<p class="message sent">Yes, the key is to keep the batter cold and avoid overmixing it. Also, using sparkling water can make it more crispy.<p class=message>I see. I'll keep that in mind. You're quite knowledgeable about cooking too.<p class="message sent">Well, I've had my fair share of cooking lessons from various chefs. I enjoy learning new techniques.<p class=message>That's great! Let's learn from each other then. I'm also excited to show you some of my own signature dishes.<p class="message sent">I can't wait. I'm sure it'll be a great cooking session, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5ef773d-de63-4bdb-ae27-cbabf330f181.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
