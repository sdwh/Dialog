It was a scary experience.<p class=message>That sounds terrifying. What did you do to get through it?<p class="message sent">We followed safety protocols, made sure everyone had their life jackets on, and kept communication lines open.<p class=message>Speaking of safety protocols, do you have any tips for dealing with maritime emergencies?<p class="message sent">Always be prepared and don't panic. Keep a well-stocked emergency kit on board and practice safety drills so everyone knows what to do.<p class=message>That's good advice. What about contacting the coast guard in case of an emergency?<p class="message sent">Always have a means of communication, such as a radio or satellite phone, to contact authorities. Make sure you know your location and give as much detail as possible.<p class=message>Makes sense. What do you think about having a designated emergency response team onboard?<p class="message sent">Having a team trained in first aid and rescue procedures can be extremely helpful in dealing with emergencies.<p class=message>Absolutely.
