It looks like we need to design new tables in SQL Server.<p class=message>Absolutely. We need to design a robust and scalable database that can handle the volume of transactions we're expecting.<p class="message sent">I agree. We need to make sure that we have the right indexes and relationships defined to optimize query performance.<p class=message>That's right. We also need to ensure that the data is stored in a normalized form to minimize data redundancy and improve data consistency.<p class="message sent">Yes, we should use the third normal form to avoid anomalies and inconsistencies in the data.<p class=message>I was thinking we could use stored procedures for some of the more complex transactions. This would help to keep the database more secure and maintainable.<p class="message sent">I agree. We can write procedures that ensure transactional consistency and prevent data corruption.<p class=message>We should also define user roles and permissions carefully. This will help to maintain the system's security and integrity.<p class="message sent">Yes, we should follow the principle of least privilege and give users only the access they need to do their jobs.<p class=message>Finally, we should make sure that we back up the database regularly and store backups offsite to ensure disaster recovery.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We need to be prepared for any kind of data loss, such as hardware failures or natural disasters.<p class=message>Great discussion, B. I feel confident that we can design a database that meets all of our requirements.<p class="message sent">Yes, it was a productive conversation. I'm excited to start implementing our design.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=191d09d7-0596-4c51-b1f7-232737e91ac6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
