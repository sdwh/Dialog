How's the fruit business going?<p class="message sent">Hey A, good morning! The fruit business is picking up pace, especially with the hot weather lately. How's the pancake cart treating you?<p class=message>It's going well, too. Although, couldn't help but notice that some of our customers like to mix our two offerings together.<p class="message sent">Really? Well, that's interesting. Maybe we should create a special dish that combines both our items.<p class=message>Oh, that's actually a really good idea! Maybe we can add some diced fruits on top of the pancake, and then drizzle some honey over it. What do you think?<p class="message sent">I love it! We could call it the "fruit-topped pancake." I'm sure it will be a best-seller.<p class=message>Sounds appetizing. Speaking of fruits, what's the difference between the jackfruit and durian? I've always been curious.<p class="message sent">Jackfruit is sweet and has a tropical flavor, while durian has a strong, distinct odor and is creamy in texture.<p class=message>Hmm, I might have to take your word on that. Durian doesn't sound very appealing to me.<p class="message sent">It's an acquired taste for sure, A. But we should fix you up with some pineapple and dragon fruits. They are sweet and refreshing.<p class=message>Yes, please. I'm always down to try new things. And I'm sure our customers will be excited to see our new creation on the menu.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Our collaboration is going to change the game in Yaowarat.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c06f874f-d520-40a3-b531-58066cdacbc4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
