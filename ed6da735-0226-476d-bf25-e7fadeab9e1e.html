I've been troubleshooting and analyzing the network traffic to identify the bottleneck.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you think there's a possibility that we can upgrade our bandwidth?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm also looking into some network policies to optimize the traffic between the different departments in the school.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. I think we can also consider limiting access to certain websites during peak hours to improve overall speed.<p class="message sent">Yea, we can use some bandwidth monitoring tools to see which websites are consuming the most data during peak times, and restrict access accordingly.<p class=message>I'm glad we're on the same page. Shall we also look into improving our Wi-Fi signals across the entire campus?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We can use some specialized software to map out the Wi-Fi coverage area, and then install repeaters or amplifiers to boost the signal.<p class=message>That's an excellent suggestion. We should also prioritize installing access points in high foot traffic areas like the library and the cafeteria.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's important to optimize our Wi-Fi coverage in these areas to ensure seamless connectivity for students and staff.<p class=message>I agree, and it's great to see how we're constantly learning and improving our network. Thank you for working together with me on this.<p class="message sent">Likewise. I'm glad we're working towards a more efficient and effective school network system.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed69ac67-580b-40a5-ae83-bcd06ff44bce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
