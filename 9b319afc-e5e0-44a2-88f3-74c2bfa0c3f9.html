Have you heard about ISO 27001 Cloud Computing?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes! That's a fancy way of securing your data on the cloud, right?<p class=message>Absolutely! I recently got certified in it and I feel like a superhero protecting valuable information.<p class="message sent">Wow, you're my hero now! So how does this ISO thing actually work?<p class=message>Well, it's like a checklist that helps you identify and manage risks in cloud computing. You have to meet certain standards and best practices for information security.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a complicated process. Do you need a Ph.D. to understand it?<p class=message>Haha, no way! It's actually very user-friendly and easy to comprehend. Even I, who graduated in art history, was able to understand it.<p class="message sent">Okay, you convinced me. But is it really useful? I mean, can't we just rely on cloud security tools?<p class=message>Sure, those tools can be helpful, but ISO 27001 Cloud Computing is like an insurance policy. You don't need it until something bad happens.<p class="message sent">Yeah, you're right. By the way, since we're talking about cloud security, have you heard any news on alien hackers from out of space trying to invade our databases?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'll include it in my risk assessment just in case. You never know what can happen in the digital universe.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's true. Thanks for the chat, hero. You've enlightened me on the importance of ISO 27001 Cloud Computing.<p class=message>Glad I could help! Remember, safety first when it comes to data protection.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9b2ad223-f0d6-4055-920e-51c8fd9d1646.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
