What's up?<p class=message>I wanted to check in on our project progress. We need to start planning out the next few weeks.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's a good idea. We've been lagging behind a bit lately.<p class=message>I was thinking we could focus on finishing up the back-end development this week.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I think we should aim to have that done in the next three days.<p class=message>Agreed. And then we can move onto UI design.<p class="message sent">Perfect, the designer has been eagerly waiting for us to finish so they can start working on their end.<p class=message>Speaking of designers, have you seen the new hire's portfolio? Their designs are amazing.<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I was really impressed. I'm excited to work with them.<p class=message>Me too. Anyway, back to the project. After UI design, we'll move onto testing and bug fixing.<p class="message sent">Right. I think it's important to allocate a good amount of time for testing, to avoid any major issues down the line.<p class=message>Definitely. And we'll also plan to have a soft launch a few weeks after that, so we'll need to account for that in our timeline as well.<p class="message sent">Sounds like we have a solid plan. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=275cf4da-847c-427d-97e0-ab4b74abfbd9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
