How was the business today?"<p class="message sent">"It was great! Our customers love our signature dish, the Roasted Duck."<p class=message>"That's amazing! It's one of the best dishes we offer here in our restaurant. By the way, I have an idea. What if we create a new dish of steamed fish with oyster sauce?"<p class="message sent">"Sounds interesting, Chef! Can you come up with a recipe for it?"<p class=message>"Of course, Boss! We can use our fresh tilapia, steam it perfectly and add our special oyster sauce with some scallions and ginger. It's going to be a hit."<p class="message sent">"I trust your instincts, Chef. Let's add it to our menu then. What do you think about the price?"<p class=message>"I think we can offer it for 25% higher than the price of the Roasted Duck. Is that okay with you, Boss?"<p class="message sent">"Sure, Chef! I think it's reasonable for a new signature dish. Let's make sure to promote it on our social media accounts too."<p class=message>"Definitely, Boss! I can take some pictures of it for our Instagram page. Speaking of Instagram, have you seen how many likes we got for our recent post about the Roasted Duck?"<p class="message sent">"Yes, Chef! It's impressive. I'm glad that people get to appreciate our authentic Cantonese dishes even on social media."<p class=message>"Absolutely, Boss! I guess we just have to keep that passion in cooking and showcasing our culture through our dishes."<p class="message sent">"You're right, Chef. We owe it to our customers for their trust and support. By the way, how's the inventory? Any ingredients we need to purchase?"<p class=message>"I already made a list, Boss. We need to replenish the bok choy, shrimps, and some condiments for our noodles."<p class="message sent">"Okay, Chef. You can go ahead and delegate it to our sous chef. Thank you for your hard work today. Rest well and see you tomorrow!"<p class=message>"Thank you too, Boss! It's always a pleasure working with you."</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=70e81909-1c79-47d7-b50f-ddd3ea065a55.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
