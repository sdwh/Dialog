How about you?<p class=message>Same here. I was actually thinking about including a joke in this article.<p class="message sent">Oh, really? What's the joke?<p class=message>Well, it's a bit cheesy, but what do you call an alligator in a vest?<p class="message sent">I have no idea. What do you call it?<p class=message>An investigate-her! Get it? Investigator, but with "her" instead of "tor."<p class="message sent">(laughs) Oh my goodness, that is so bad it's actually good.<p class=message>Glad you think so. I wasn't sure if it was too corny.<p class="message sent">No, it's perfect. It fits in well with the tone of the article.<p class=message>Great!<p class="message sent">Have you made any progress on the rest of the piece?<p class=message>Yeah, I've gone through and tightened up some of the language. It should flow much better now.<p class="message sent">That's excellent. I think this is going to be a fantastic article once it's published.<p class=message>Thanks! I'm excited to see it in print.<p class="message sent">As am I. It's always satisfying to see the finished product of our hard work.<p class=message>Absolutely. And who knows, maybe our readers will get a kick out of our alligator joke.<p class="message sent">I'm sure they will. Especially anyone who likes a good pun.<p class=message>(laughs) Yep, the punsters will definitely appreciate it.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's get back to work. We've got a deadline to meet.<p class=message>Right you are.
