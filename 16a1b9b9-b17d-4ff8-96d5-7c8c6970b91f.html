How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thanks. So, let's get to business. We need to choose the course materials for our upcoming class.<p class="message sent">Yes, we do. I was thinking about using the textbook from the last course. It was well received by the students.<p class=message>That's a good point, but I think we should consider using new materials to keep the class fresh and engaging.<p class="message sent">That's a valid point too. Do you have any suggestions?<p class=message>Yes, I was looking at some online resources that offer interactive exercises and multimedia materials. Students love those types of things.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Can you send me the links so I can take a look?<p class=message>Of course! I'll email them to you right after this meeting.<p class="message sent">Great. I also think we should choose materials that cover different learning styles, so all the students can benefit.<p class=message>Agreed. We could include some audio recordings, videos, and hands-on activities.<p class="message sent">That's a good variety. I think we're on the right track.<p class=message>Yeah, I'm feeling good about this decision. And let's not forget to include some humor in the course materials too. A good laugh can brighten up anyone's day.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Laughter is the best medicine, after all.<p class=message>Well, I think we've got this covered. Thanks for your input, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Always a pleasure working with you.<p class=message>Same to you. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=16a01c21-73f4-4369-9f10-63a05bc0e5f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
