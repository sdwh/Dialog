Are you ready for some fruit picking?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, I am. I have never done this before, can you show me the ropes?<p class=message>Sure thing! What fruit would you like to pick first?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about apples? I love them!<p class=message>Great choice! Here's a basket, now let's look for some good apples.<p class="message sent">Do you have any tips on how to find the best ones?<p class=message>Well, look for ones that are bright and firm. Also, be sure to avoid any that have visible bruises or soft spots.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. This is so exciting!<p class=message>It is! And you get to enjoy fresh fruit after. What brought you to Australia?<p class="message sent">I'm just here on vacation, exploring the country. I heard the fruit in this area was delicious, so I had to come try it.<p class=message>That's awesome. Are you from a big city?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm from New York. It's quite different here, but I love the scenic views.<p class=message>I can imagine! This is a pretty remote area, but we enjoy the quiet life.<p class="message sent">It's a nice change of pace from the busy city life. Do you enjoy living here?<p class=message>Yes, I do. There's something special about living off the land and providing produce for others to enjoy.<p class="message sent">That's very admirable. I'm glad I had the chance to experience it for myself.<p class=message>It was great having you here. Feel free to take some fresh fruit with you as a reminder of your trip.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! I'll definitely enjoy every bite.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6d4aa84b-9ecf-46e8-ba56-58ea6fddbd3d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
