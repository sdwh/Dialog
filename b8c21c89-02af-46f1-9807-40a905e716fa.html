Have you ever designed a website before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I actually have. Why do you ask?<p class=message>I'm currently designing a website for my friend's business and I'm wondering what are some basic principles of website design. Do you have any advice?<p class="message sent">Sure! First and foremost, your website should have a clear and easy-to-use navigation menu.<p class=message>That makes sense. What about the design layout?<p class="message sent">Your design should be visually appealing, but not too cluttered. Keep it simple and clean.<p class=message>Good point. What about the content?<p class="message sent">Your content should be well-organized and easy to read. Break it up into sections with headings and use bullet points for important information.<p class=message>That's helpful. What about images and videos?<p class="message sent">Use high-quality images and videos that are relevant to your content. But be careful not to make them too large, as they can slow down the loading time of your website.<p class=message>Ah, I didn't think of that. Is there anything else I should keep in mind?<p class="message sent">Yes, make sure your website is mobile-friendly! More and more people are browsing the web on their phones and tablets, so it's important to have a responsive design.<p class=message>Great advice! Thanks so much for your help.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. Let me know if you have any other questions during the design process.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b8bca1a8-9f9d-4629-a143-de3f70e6aa55.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
