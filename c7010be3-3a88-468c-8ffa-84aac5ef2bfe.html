How was everyone's weekend?<p class="message sent">Hi, teacher! My weekend was great. I went to the beach with my friends. How about you?<p class=message>I had a relaxing weekend. I caught up on some reading and watched a movie. But now, let's get down to business. Today, we will be learning about idioms.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting. Can you give us an example?<p class=message>Sure. "The ball is in your court" means it's your turn to make a decision or take action.<p class="message sent">Ah, I understand now. Can we try to use some more idioms in our conversation?<p class=message>Of course. Let's make it a challenge. The first one to use an idiom correctly gets a bonus point.<p class="message sent">Challenge accepted! "Let's cut to the chase" and start with the lesson.<p class=message>Very good, Student B! That's correct. But let's not "put all our eggs in one basket" and try to come up with different idioms. Anyone else?<p class=message>Excellent, Student C! Now let's see if we can use all these idioms in one sentence. "Let's cut to the chase, the ball is in your court, but donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket, because we might end up barking up the wrong tree."<p class="message sent">(laughs) That sounds like a tongue-twister. But I get it!<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. Now let's continue our lesson on idioms. Maybe we can even create our own idioms by the end of class.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a fun challenge. Let's "go the extra mile" and learn more about idioms.<p class=message>You're on a roll, Student B! Keep it up. I have a feeling you'll be making up your own idioms in no time.<p class=message>You're welcome, Student C. And thank you, everyone, for your participation. Let's end today's class on a high note and "keep our eyes peeled" for more fun activities next time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c6fbc8e1-3d0b-47c5-b962-49a9c33c8ab1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
