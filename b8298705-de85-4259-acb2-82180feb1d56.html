How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too shabby, A. What's on your mind?<p class=message>I've been thinking about DDoS attacks lately. Have you ever dealt with one of those before?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, they're a real pain in the butt.<p class=message>So what do you think we should do to combat them?<p class="message sent">Well, first we need to make sure we have a strong defense system in place.<p class=message>Agreed. But what about when the attack actually happens?<p class="message sent">We'll need to be quick on our feet and work together as a team.<p class=message>I've heard about using a CDN to absorb the traffic. What do you think about that?<p class="message sent">That's definitely an option. We can also set up a network of proxies to distribute the traffic.<p class=message>Proxies can be tricky though. We'll need to make sure we're not creating any additional vulnerabilities.<p class="message sent">Good point. We'll also need to monitor the traffic flow and identify any suspicious activity.<p class=message>And what about the users who are trying to access our sites during the attack?<p class="message sent">We'll need to handle them differently, possibly redirecting them to a backup server until the attack is over.<p class=message>Right. And what about using AI or machine learning to detect and prevent attacks?<p class="message sent">Definitely. That's an area where we can always improve and stay ahead of the game.<p class=message>This is all great stuff, B. I'm feeling more confident already.<p class="message sent">Don't get too comfortable, A. We never know when the next attack might hit.<p class=message>Ha, you're right about that. But at least I know I can count on you to have my back.<p class="message sent">Always, my friend. That's what teamwork is all about.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b8296aa1-757d-40c6-a996-0278fd9d4872.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
