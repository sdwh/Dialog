How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've never had surgery before.<p class=message>Don't worry, Mr. B. You're in good hands. We've conducted many successful surgeries before.<p class="message sent">That's comforting to hear. So, can you tell me what exactly you'll be doing?<p class=message>Of course. We'll be performing a minor surgery on your knee. We'll remove a small piece of cartilage that's causing the discomfort you've been experiencing.<p class="message sent">Okay, that doesn't sound too bad.<p class=message>It's a routine procedure. You'll be under anesthesia the entire time, so you won't feel a thing.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. How long will it take?<p class=message>The procedure itself should take about an hour. However, we'll need to monitor you for a bit after the surgery to make sure everything went well.<p class="message sent">Alright, I think I understand. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?<p class=message>Yes, we'll need you to fast for at least twelve hours prior to the surgery. Also, you'll need to avoid taking any blood-thinning medications for a week before the procedure.<p class="message sent">Got it. Thanks for letting me know.<p class=message>No problem. Is there anything else you're wondering about?<p class="message sent">No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor.<p class=message>You're welcome, Mr. B. You're in good hands. The surgery will be over before you know it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4216cca9-073b-4aca-b7b1-0b9a41db3cd2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
