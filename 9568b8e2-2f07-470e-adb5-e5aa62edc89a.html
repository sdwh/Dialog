I can't wait to see how this turns out.<p class=message>Me too. I think we have a great shot at making this movie really special.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Speaking of special, did you see the craft services table this morning?<p class=message>The one with all the donuts and pastries? Yeah, I had to resist diving in head first.<p class="message sent">I failed that test. The sugar rush is giving me the energy for the day though.<p class=message>Gotta love those sugar rushes. So, for this scene I'm thinking we really play up the tension between your character and the villain.<p class="message sent">I'm all for it. Any tips for channeling that tension?<p class=message>Just imagine that the villain stole your last donut. That'll do the trick.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I'll remember that. Hey, have you seen my script? I swear it was here a second ago.<p class=message>I'm pretty sure I saw it over by the monitor. Want me to grab it for you?<p class="message sent">That'd be amazing, thank you.<p class=message>No problem. By the way, did you hear what happened to Dan on set yesterday?<p class="message sent">No, what happened?<p class=message>He spilled coffee all over his shirt like 5 minutes before his close-up. We had to improvise.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Poor guy. At least we know anything can happen on set.<p class=message>That's the magic of filmmaking, right? Alright, let's get ready for this scene. We're gonna nail it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=95673b2c-d2c3-42d0-817e-b0c17896998a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
