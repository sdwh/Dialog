Are you in charge of the baggage handling process here at the airport?<p class="message sent">Good morning, yes I am! How can I assist you?<p class=message>I’m a flight attendant and I just wanted to confirm the baggage procedures for our flight.<p class="message sent">Sure, I’d be happy to help. Are you checking any bags for this flight?<p class=message>Yes, we have quite a few bags to check in. How early do they need to be checked in before the flight?<p class="message sent">We recommend that they are checked in at least 60 minutes prior to your scheduled boarding time. That will give us enough time to get them to the aircraft.<p class=message>Perfect, and what about oversized items like bicycles or golf clubs?<p class="message sent">Those items can be checked in as well, but it's best to check with your airline first to ensure any fee payments and restrictions.<p class=message>Got it, thank you! What happens if a passenger’s bag is lost or delayed?<p class="message sent">If a bag is lost or delayed, keep in touch with your airline’s representative at the airport. Airlines have different policies regarding reimbursement for delayed or lost items.<p class=message>That makes sense. Is there anything else I should be aware of regarding baggage?<p class="message sent">Just make sure all of your passengers are aware of any size or weight restrictions for carry-on baggage—as well as any items that are prohibited.<p class=message>Understood! Thanks for your help. You’ve made our check-in process much smoother.<p class="message sent">You’re welcome! Have a pleasant flight and take care.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a8c1a314-4c55-4ea4-b49a-dd69ee07ca19.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
