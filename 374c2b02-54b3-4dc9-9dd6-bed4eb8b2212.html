It looks just like the one we used to have when you were little.<p class="message sent">Really? I don't remember us ever having a dog.<p class=message>That's because you were only three when we had to give him away. He was too rambunctious for our apartment.<p class="message sent">Aw, I wish we still had him. I love dogs.<p class=message>Me too. Maybe someday when you have your own place, you can get a dog of your own.<p class="message sent">That would be awesome. Hey, look, there's a squirrel!<p class=message>Don't try to chase it, B. You might scare it away.<p class="message sent">I won't. But can we go check out those flowers over there? They smell really good.<p class=message>Sure thing. Those are lilies. They're my favorite flowers.<p class="message sent">They're really pretty. My girlfriend loves flowers too. I'll have to remember to get her some lilies.<p class=message>That's a great idea. Speaking of your girlfriend, how's everything going with her?<p class="message sent">Really well, thanks. We're planning to go to the beach next weekend.<p class=message>That sounds like fun. Just make sure you wear sunscreen!<p class="message sent">Don't worry, Dad. I'll be careful. Hey, look at that old man over there. He's doing tai chi.<p class=message>That's a great way to stay healthy. Maybe we should try it sometime.<p class="message sent">Yeah, but I don't think I have the patience for it.<p class=message>You might surprise yourself. Tai chi can be a great stress reliever.<p class="message sent">I guess that's true. Hey, do you remember when we used to play catch in this park?<p class=message>Of course I do. You were always a natural athlete.<p class="message sent">Ha, not anymore. Too much time sitting in front of the computer.<p class=message>It's never too late to get back into shape, B. Maybe we can start a weekend workout routine together.<p class="message sent">I'd like that, Dad. I could use a little motivation.<p class=message>Perfect, that's settled then. Let's head home and make some lunch.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Thanks for the walk, Dad. It was really nice to spend some time together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=37496f3e-cdbb-49b3-88cf-e39edf1b7c75.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
