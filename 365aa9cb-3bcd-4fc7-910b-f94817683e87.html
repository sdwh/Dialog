How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm feeling great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too, just a bit tired from yesterday's shoot.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I noticed you were dozing off during the break. Coffee will be your best friend today!<p class=message>(laughs) You know me too well, B. So, what's on the schedule for today?<p class="message sent">Today, we'll be filming the scene where you jump out of the plane.<p class=message>(eyes widen) Oh, that sounds exciting! So, do I get to do some crazy stunts?<p class="message sent">Of course! I wouldn't hire you if you're not willing to take risks. But don't worry, we have safety measures in place.<p class=message>(nervously chuckles) That's reassuring to hear. So, what do I need to do to prepare for this scene?<p class="message sent">Just follow the instruction of our stunt coordinator and wear the proper gear. Oh, and make sure you don't forget your parachute!<p class=message>(sarcastically) Yeah, that would be a disaster. Hey, speaking of disasters, did you hear about that director who accidentally set his own wig on fire during a shoot?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, I heard about that. That's why I stick to my own hair.<p class=message>(smirks) And your daily hair-steaming routine.<p class="message sent">(grinning) Hey, don't knock it till you try it! But enough about my hair, let's get this show on the road.<p class=message>(determined) I'm ready for this. Let's make some movie magic!<p class="message sent">(smiling) That's the spirit. All right, A. Let's get you up there in the sky!<p class=message>(takes a deep breath) Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3659adc8-7475-4643-8721-6a3f93bb66f9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
