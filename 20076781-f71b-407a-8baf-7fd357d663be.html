It's going well, just the final touches left to add.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What were some of the interesting findings during this audit?<p class="message sent">Well, we found that the password policy was being followed quite strictly, but there were a few employees who were still using 'password123' as their password.<p class=message>Haha! I know, right? It's shocking how people still use such weak passwords.<p class="message sent">Exactly, and we need to make sure we address that issue in the report.<p class=message>Agreed. We also noticed that the backup system needed a bit of improvement.<p class="message sent">Yes, we recommended a better backup solution, especially for critical data.<p class=message>I see, sounds like a good recommendation. Did you get a chance to check out the server room?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. It was extremely cold in there, and I couldn't help but think that it would be a perfect spot to store frozen food!<p class=message>(laughs) Yeah, it could definitely pass for a meat locker. But on a serious note, we should probably recommend some measures to regulate the temperature in there.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, we don't want our servers turning into ice cubes!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=20069154-09c0-451c-8078-68cc5798e0b2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
