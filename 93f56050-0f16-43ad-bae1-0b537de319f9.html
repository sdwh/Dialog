My focus is on network security. How about you?<p class=message>I work on understanding and analyzing cyber attacks and vulnerabilities for businesses.<p class="message sent">That's very interesting. What have you found as the most common types of attacks?<p class=message>Phishing attacks are by far the most common. But I am also seeing an increase in ransomware attacks.<p class="message sent">I agree, ransomware is becoming a real problem. Have you seen any particularly clever attacks recently?<p class=message>Yes, there was a recent one where the attacker used a social engineering technique to trick an employee into installing malware.<p class="message sent">Ah yes, social engineering is a really effective tactic. It's important to train employees to recognize these kinds of attacks.<p class=message>Definitely. Speaking of employee training, have you seen any trends in how companies are preparing for security threats?<p class="message sent">Yes, more and more companies are investing in employee training and also in technology like firewalls and intrusion detection software.<p class=message>That's great to hear. It's important that companies take security seriously and invest in the right measures.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's always better to be proactive and prevent attacks from happening in the first place.<p class=message>Absolutely, prevention is key in security. By the way, have you tried the coffee in the break room here? It's surprisingly good.<p class="message sent">Haha, no I haven't. I'll have to check it out. And we should probably get back to work too. Nice chatting with you.<p class=message>Likewise. See you around.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=93ed49e7-e8cf-42a1-9eeb-82540a296f9b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
