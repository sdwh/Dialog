Let's start the class with a little game. Who can tell me what rhymes with "cat"?<p class="message sent">I know, I know! It's "bat"!<p class=message>Very good! Now, can you tell me something that starts with "B" and ends with "ook"?<p class="message sent">Hmm, this is a tough one. Cook, no, that doesn't start with a "B". Oh, I got it! Book!<p class=message>Excellent! You're quite the wordsmith, aren't you? Now, who here loves to read?<p class="message sent">Me! Me! I can't get enough of books.<p class=message>That's fantastic. What's your favorite book?<p class="message sent">It's "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone". I've read it more times than I can count.<p class=message>Ah, a fellow Potterhead. I love those books too. Do you know what Hogwarts House you'd be sorted into?<p class="message sent">I think I'd be in Gryffindor because I value bravery and courage.<p class=message>I like your thinking. But don't forget about the other Houses, they all have their unique qualities. Speaking of which, did you know that there's a real-life Hogwarts in Poland?<p class="message sent">What?! Really? Can we visit it someday?<p class=message>Absolutely. It's actually a castle called Zamek Czocha, and they offer tours and even have a Harry Potter-themed weekend.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. I can't wait to go there and live out my Hogwarts dreams.<p class=message>Well, that's all the time we have for now. See you next class, everyone. And remember, keep learning and having fun!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e552ba61-4804-41be-8e02-76580cea2244.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
