I am thrilled to be performing here at the iconic Sydney Opera House tonight.<p class="message sent message-content">Good evening! I have been looking forward to this concert for weeks. What will you be playing tonight?<p class="message received message-content">I will be playing a mix of classical and modern pieces on my violin. It's a program I've been working on for a while now.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds fascinating. Which composers are you playing?<p class="message received message-content">Some of the classical pieces are by Mozart and Bach, but I'll also be playing some more contemporary pieces by Australian composer Elena Kats-Chernin.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, I love her work! You're playing her 'Clocks' and 'Butterflying' aren't you?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, those are two of my favorites. I love the energy they bring to the performance.<p class="message sent message-content">I can't wait to hear it. How long have you been playing the violin?<p class="message received message-content">I've been playing since I was 5 years old, so it's been about 20 years now. I can't imagine my life without music.<p class="message sent message-content">Wow, that's dedication. Do you have any advice for someone who wants to learn an instrument?<p class="message received message-content">My main advice would be to practice every day, even if it's just for a short amount of time. Consistency is key.<p class="message sent message-content">Thank you for that. And just one more question before the concert starts: what's the most memorable performance you've ever done?<p class="message received message-content">That's a tough one, but I think it was when I played at Carnegie Hall in New York City. The atmosphere there is electric.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds amazing. Well, thank you for taking the time to chat with me. I'm excited to hear your performance tonight.<p class="message received message-content">Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the show.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=094fa2a7-1511-40b5-8731-6862cfab844b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
