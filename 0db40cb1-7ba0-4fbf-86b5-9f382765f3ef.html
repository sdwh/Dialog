How are you doing today?<p class="message sent message-content">I'm great, thank you for asking. How about you, Tutor A?<p class="message received message-content">I'm doing well, thanks. So, let's discuss the progress we've made in the course so far. How do you feel about it?<p class="message sent message-content">I think we're making good progress. I particularly enjoyed the last lesson on phrasal verbs.<p class="message received message-content">That's great to hear. I agree, phrasal verbs can be tricky but they're so important to learn.<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely. What's next on the syllabus?<p class="message received message-content">We'll be focusing on idioms in our next lesson. I think you'll find it really interesting.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, I love learning about idioms! Can you give me a sneak peek of what we'll be learning?<p class="message received message-content">Sure! We'll be looking at some common idioms related to animals and their meanings. For example, "raining cats and dogs" means it's raining heavily.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds like a fun lesson. Speaking of animals, have you ever had a pet?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, I had a dog when I was growing up. How about you?<p class="message sent message-content">I have a cat named Mr. Whiskers. He's very playful and likes to meow a lot.<p class="message received message-content">Aww, that sounds adorable. I'm more of a dog person myself, but I appreciate cats too.<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, they each have their own unique personalities. Anyway, back to the course. When is our next quiz?<p class="message received message-content">Our next quiz will be next week after we've finished the Idioms lesson. But don't worry - we'll have a review session before the quiz to go over everything.<p class="message sent message-content">That's great to know. I'll make sure to study hard. Thanks, Tutor A! This was a great discussion.<p class="message received message-content">You're welcome, B. Keep up the good work and let me know if you have any questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0db334be-864a-4ca1-8c0b-c9d455706406.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
