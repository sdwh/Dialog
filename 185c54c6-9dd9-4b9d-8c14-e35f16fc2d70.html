How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm feeling great! I'm really excited to discuss our publication plan today.<p class="message sent">Me too! So, what do you have in mind?<p class=message>I was thinking we could publish a collection of short stories that would be perfect for summer reading.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! What kind of short stories do you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, I've been working on a few that are light-hearted and humorous. I think they would really fit the bill for what people are looking for in the summer.<p class="message sent">I love it! We could call it "Sunshine Shorts" or something catchy like that.<p class=message>That sounds perfect! And we could even have some illustrations to go along with the stories.<p class="message sent">Yes, that would be great. Do you have anyone in mind for the illustrations?<p class=message>Actually, I do. My friend is a fantastic artist and I think his style would really complement the stories.<p class="message sent">Wonderful! And have you thought about the release date?<p class=message>Yes, I was thinking we could aim for a mid-June release, right before the peak of summer.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan to me. Let me get started on the logistics and we'll make it happen.<p class=message>Thanks, B! I'm excited to see what we can do with this project.<p class="message sent">Me too. I think it's going to be a hit.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=185bcfa6-1943-40ef-ac58-994d5f4d61fa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
