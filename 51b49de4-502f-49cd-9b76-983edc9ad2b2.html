I heard you're on a quest to find a missing wizard?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I heard he was last seen in these parts of the forest. Do you have any leads?<p class=message>Well, I am a skilled elven archer and I've been keeping an eye out for him while hunting game. However, I haven't spotted anything yet.<p class="message sent">That's too bad. I thought maybe the wizard would have left some clues behind.<p class=message>Wait a second, I did notice something strange earlier today. There was a patch of grass that was flattened in a peculiar way. It may be nothing, but it caught my attention.<p class="message sent">Thank you for telling me, we should go check it out. Maybe it could lead us to the wizard.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. But be on the lookout, we still have no idea what caused that patch of grass.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'm a warrior. I'm always alert.<p class=message>Great! And if we do find the wizard, do you think he will reward us with some magical trinkets?<p class="message sent">I hope so! I could use a good enchanted sword.<p class=message>And I could use a set of magical arrows that never miss their target.<p class="message sent">Speaking of magical arrows, how many do you have left?<p class=message>Hmm, let me see. I have one, two...wait a minute, where did the third one go?<p class="message sent">Did you lose it?<p class=message>No, I had it with me this morning. I hope I didn't misplace it.<p class="message sent">Keep your head up, maybe there's still hope.<p class=message>I hope so. But let's focus on finding the wizard first.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=51b481b6-4249-4eea-881a-a9b3baa2dbbd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
