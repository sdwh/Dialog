How about you?<p class=message>Busy as always, but I love it. Being the manager of this Mexican restaurant definitely keeps me on my toes.<p class="message sent">Indeed, we are always busy. By the way, have you tried our new vegetarian enchiladas?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've heard great things about them. Maybe I'll have to try them for lunch.<p class="message sent">You definitely should, they are amazing. Speaking of lunch, did you have a chance to check our reservation schedule for today?<p class=message>Oh, yes. We're pretty much booked up for the lunch rush, but I think we can accommodate a few more reservations for dinner.<p class="message sent">That's great news! I'll make sure to let our host know.<p class=message>Perfect. By the way, did you hear about that new taco shop down the street?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. But, why go to a taco shop when we have the best tacos in town right here?<p class=message>You're right about that. Our tacos are definitely a crowd-pleaser.<p class="message sent">Speaking of crowds, I bet we'll have a lot of Texans coming in to celebrate this weekend's rodeo.<p class=message>That's for sure. We better make sure we have enough beef and chicken for our delicious fajitas.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, A. We have plenty in stock. I'll double-check our inventory just to make sure.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. You are always on top of things, B.<p class="message sent">Well, it's our job to make sure our customers leave happy and satisfied.<p class=message>You're absolutely right. And I think we do a pretty good job at that.<p class="message sent">Agreed. So, do you need any help with anything else, A?<p class=message>No, for now, everything seems to be running smoothly. But I appreciate your willingness to help.<p class="message sent">Of course, that's what I'm here for. Let's make it a great day!<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's show our customers what true Mexican hospitality looks like.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=62a10e30-6a40-4116-b0d3-2299ef1ff032.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
