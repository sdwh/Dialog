Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Yes, A! I was thinking of adding a vegan burger. It's healthy, and it's also perfect for our vegan customers.<p class=message>Oh, that's a great idea! How about our dessert options?<p class="message sent">I was actually thinking of adding a new flavor of ice cream - blueberry cheesecake!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds delicious. Do you think our customers will like it?<p class="message sent">I'm pretty sure they will! Plus, we can always offer a small taste test to get their opinion.<p class=message>Speaking of taste tests, do you remember when we tried that spicy noodle dish from the new restaurant down the street?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do! My mouth was on fire for hours. But it was worth it.<p class=message>Haha, I agree. Hey, have you ever tried cooking with edible flowers? I heard they've become quite trendy.<p class="message sent">Actually, I have! I used them as a garnish for a salmon dish. It looked beautiful and tasted amazing.<p class=message>You're so talented, B. I bet our customers will love it.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! Speaking of customers, do you remember that one time when we had that rude customer who complained about everything?<p class=message>Oh, yes. I remember that. But do you also remember how we turned them into a happy customer?<p class="message sent">Of course! We gave them a free dessert and they left happy.<p class=message>That just goes to show that sometimes, a little kindness goes a long way.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Hey, A, it looks like our time is up for today. We should continue discussing new menu options tomorrow.<p class=message>Yeah, you're right. Thanks for a great discussion, B. See you tomorrow!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8f3c1749-6df1-4a5a-bea5-646174a2916f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
