How about you?<p class=message>Same here. What level are you on?<p class="message sent">Level 5. It's a tricky one, but I'm determined to solve it.<p class=message>I'm on level 7. Have you tried using the clues?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but they're not much help. I think I need to think outside the box.<p class=message>That's a good idea. Sometimes the answer isn't always obvious.<p class="message sent">Exactly. Hey, did I tell you about the time I solved a puzzle in under a minute?<p class=message>No way! How did you do it?<p class="message sent">It was a number sequence puzzle, and I just happened to see the pattern right away.<p class=message>That's impressive. I once spent hours on a puzzle and then realized I was missing a piece.<p class="message sent">Oh no, that's the worst feeling. But at least it wasn't the final piece, right?<p class=message>True. Hey, have you ever played a puzzle game that was so addictive, you couldn't stop playing?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I once spent an entire weekend playing a word matching game. It was so frustrating, but I couldn't put it down.<p class=message>Haha, I know the feeling. Well, good luck with level 5.<p class="message sent">Thanks, you too with level 7. Let's compare notes when we're done.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=69360313-d5dc-4064-a303-cac2883d2d04.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
