It's a set of standards for information security, right?<p class=message>Exactly! It covers everything from risk assessment to incident response.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot to unpack. Do you know what the most important part of the standard is?<p class=message>Well, it all comes down to what's most important for your organization's security. But I think the risk assessment is key.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Without knowing what risks we face, it's hard to design an effective security plan.<p class=message>And once we identify risks, we can prioritize our security measures based on what's most important.<p class="message sent">Right. But what about the actual security controls? How do we know what we need to put in place?<p class=message>That's where the detailed requirements come in. They cover everything from access control to network security.<p class="message sent">Got it. But how do we ensure we're meeting all the requirements?<p class=message>That's where certification and auditing come in. We can have our security program audited by an external auditor to ensure we're meeting the standard.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of work. Is it really worth it?<p class=message>Absolutely! Compliance with the standard can increase customer trust and help us avoid costly security breaches.<p class="message sent">Good point. I'm going to start looking into this more. Thanks for the helpful conversation, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. Happy to chat about anything security-related anytime!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f55a5a61-bfb9-4d62-ba00-6a9e7724d849.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
