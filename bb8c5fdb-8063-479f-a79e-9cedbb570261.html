How's it going with the audit?<p class="message sent">Hey! It's going pretty well, thanks for asking. I'm just trying to make sure everything is up to snuff with ISO 27001.<p class=message>Yeah, it can be a lot of work, but it's worth it in the end.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I don't want any breaches or issues down the line.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have you heard any interesting cybersecurity stories lately?<p class="message sent">Oh man, have I ever! There was this one company that got hacked because an employee used “password” as their password.<p class=message>(laughs) You've got to be kidding me.<p class="message sent">I wish I was! That's why it's so important to educate everyone on good security practices.<p class=message>Agreed. Hey, have you ever had to deal with a phishing scam?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, a few times unfortunately. The scammers always seem to be getting better and better.<p class=message>It's crazy. But hey, let's lighten up the conversation a bit. What's the most ridiculous password you've ever heard of someone using?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think... I once had a client who used “123456789” as their password. And the worst part is they used it for all their accounts!<p class=message>Oh man, that's just asking for trouble. (laughs) It's been great chatting with you, and keep up the good work on the audit!<p class="message sent">Thanks, you too! And stay safe out there.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bb8a8165-107e-4f75-ae24-4f486fc18c47.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
