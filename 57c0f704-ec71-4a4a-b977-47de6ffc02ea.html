How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey boss, all good here. Just prepping some dough for the bread.<p class=message>Awesome. You've been doing a great job with the bread lately. Customers love it.<p class="message sent">Thanks! Your grilled meats are a hit too. People can't seem to get enough of them.<p class=message>That's because we make a fantastic team. BBQ and bread, a match made in heaven.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I've been experimenting with some new flavors too. Have you tried the garlic and rosemary bread?<p class=message>No, but it sounds delicious. Why didn't you tell me?<p class="message sent">Saving it as a surprise for you, boss. Let me know what you think once you try it.<p class=message>Will do. Speaking of surprises, I've got some exciting news. The authorities are considering granting us permission to stay open later at night.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic! More business for us.<p class=message>Exactly. And I was thinking we could offer a special nighttime menu featuring some unique items.<p class="message sent">Like what?<p class=message>How about grilled bananas with chocolate sauce? Or bacon-wrapped corn on the cob?<p class="message sent">Oh man, my mouth is watering already. Let's do this!<p class=message>I knew you'd be on board. Let's get back to work and make this happen.<p class="message sent">You got it, boss. Pass me those skewers, we've got some grilling to do!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=57bbd4cb-a8d9-4fd2-8598-417ad0687505.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
