Are you here to see the famous Lady of New York?<p class="message sent">Yeah! I've been excited to see the Statue of Liberty all my life.<p class=message>Brilliant, you've picked the perfect spot to capture the moment. Let me help you take some amazing shots here.<p class="message sent">Thank you! Where do you suggest I should stand?<p class=message>You can stand in front of the iconic statue with a pose of your choice. Maybe spread your arms out like Lady Liberty herself?<p class="message sent">(chuckles) I'm not sure if I can pull off that pose. How about something simpler?<p class=message>No problem! Maybe try standing just to the left of the statue with your arm angled up. That's a classic pose that'll look great.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, I'll give it a try. Can you also tell me more about the history of the statue while we're at it?<p class=message>Absolutely! Did you know that the statue was a gift from France? It was built in 1886 as a symbol of freedom and democracy.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's interesting. I didn't know that. Thank you for sharing!<p class=message>No problem, happy to help out. Plus, once you've taken those perfect pictures, you can visit the museum and learn more about the statue's history.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. I'm definitely adding that to my list. Thanks again for your help!<p class=message>My pleasure! Enjoy the rest of your time here in New York.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b17ac44-9e9f-43be-a903-bf1a00fd5b32.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
