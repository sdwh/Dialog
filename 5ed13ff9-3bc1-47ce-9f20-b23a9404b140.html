It's great to work with another chef in the kitchen. What desserts are you making today?<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you too! I'm making a batch of chocolate chip cookies and a lemon cake. How about you?<p class=message>I'm going to make a red velvet cake and some macarons. Do you have any tips for making perfect macarons?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Always let the egg whites reach room temperature before beating them. And don't overmix the batter - it should be glossy and smooth, but not runny.<p class=message>That's really helpful! Thanks. Oh, and how do you prevent your chocolate chip cookies from spreading out too much?<p class="message sent">One trick is to chill the dough before baking. And you can also use a little more flour in the recipe.<p class=message>I see. You seem to be very experienced in baking. How long have you been a chef?<p class="message sent">I've been working in professional kitchens for about 10 years now. I started as a line cook and gradually moved into pastry.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. I'm still relatively new to the industry. What made you want to become a chef?<p class="message sent">I've always enjoyed cooking and baking, but I didn't seriously consider it as a career until I took a cooking class in high school. The rest is history, as they say.<p class=message>That's really inspiring. I've always loved sweets and desserts, so becoming a pastry chef was a natural choice for me.<p class="message sent">It sounds like we both found our true passion in the kitchen. Let's make some delicious desserts together!<p class=message>Yes, let's do it! I'm looking forward to tasting your chocolate chip cookies.<p class="message sent">And I can't wait to try your macarons. We're going to make a great team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ecfd4c5-1e4c-4223-961b-8b2459651a53.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
