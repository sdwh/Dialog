I'm just coding away in Ruby on Rails. How about you?<p class=message>Same here! It's amazing how much you can do with just a few lines of code in RoR.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And have you heard of the latest RoR update? They've added some really useful features.<p class=message>Yeah, I read about it in the developer newsletter. I can't wait to try them out.<p class="message sent">Me too. Hey, did you know that there's a RoR meetup happening next week? I was thinking of going.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea! It'd be nice to meet other RoR developers and see what they're working on.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And who knows, maybe we'll learn something new and useful too.<p class=message>Speaking of learning, have you tried any online RoR courses or tutorials recently?<p class="message sent">Funny you should ask - I just signed up for one last week. It's been really helpful so far.<p class=message>Nice! Which course is it?<p class="message sent">It's called "Learn Ruby on Rails by Building Projects." The projects are really fun to work on.<p class=message>That sounds like a blast. I might have to give it a try myself.<p class="message sent">I highly recommend it. Hey, have you ever had any funny coding mishaps in RoR?<p class=message>Oh man, don't get me started. I once accidentally deleted an entire module and had to start from scratch.<p class="message sent">Ouch. My worst mistake was forgetting to close a block of code and spending hours trying to figure out why my app wasn't working.<p class=message>Haha, we've all been there. But you know what they say - coding is 90% debugging.<p class="message sent">Ain't that the truth. Anyway, time to get back to work. Catch you later, A.<p class=message>Take care, B. Keep coding like a boss!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ff20708-5945-4d83-8da8-fb837b2543a0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
