Have you added the hops yet?<p class="message sent">Hey A, yes I did. I added some exotic South African hops to give our beer that unique local flavor.<p class=message>That's awesome! Our customers will definitely love that. Did you follow the recipe strictly or did you make some adjustments?<p class="message sent">I added a little bit of my own secret ingredient to give it a little twist. But don't worry, it won't change the overall taste too much.<p class=message>Sounds intriguing. Can you give me a clue about what it is?<p class="message sent">Sorry A, my secret ingredient is top secret. I can't reveal it to anyone.<p class=message>Haha, I understand. So, how long do we have to wait for the beer to be ready?<p class="message sent">It will take a few weeks for the beer to mature and for the flavors to develop more fully. But I tell you what, we can try a little sample in a week or so to see how it's coming along.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I can't wait to taste it. I'm sure it's going to be amazing.<p class="message sent">I hope so. It's always exciting to try out new recipes and see what they turn out like.<p class=message>Definitely. And the best part is, we get to drink our own beer and enjoy it with our friends.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's a pretty cool feeling to know that we helped create something that people enjoy.<p class=message>Absolutely. I'm proud to be a part of this brewing team. We make some of the best beer in Cape Town.<p class="message sent">High five to that, A! We'll keep the standards high and keep our customers happy with our flavorful beer.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=24ec6c7b-7c8e-44b8-957e-913cd01072af.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
