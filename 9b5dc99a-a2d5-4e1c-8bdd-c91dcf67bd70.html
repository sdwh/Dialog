I'm a food flavorist. Could you please tell me more about the type of dishes you serve in your restaurant?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Of course, we specialize in traditional Italian cuisine. What kind of flavors can you recommend for our pasta dishes?<p class=message>I think a good mix of basil, oregano, and thyme will give your pasta a classic Italian flavor. You can also try using a touch of garlic and Parmesan cheese for more depth.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! What about our seafood options? Do you have any suggestions?<p class=message>For seafood, I would recommend using lemon zest, capers, and parsley. These ingredients bring a fresh and delicious flavor to your dishes.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, I can almost taste it already! And how about our meat dishes?<p class=message>For meat dishes, you can't go wrong with rosemary, sage, and thyme. These herbs will add a savory and aromatic flavor to any meat dish.<p class="message sent">I love those herbs! They work perfectly with our lamb and beef dishes. Thank you so much for your recommendations.<p class=message>No problem at all, it's my pleasure to help. Do you need any assistance with the measurements or any specific preparations for the ingredients?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. What would be the measurements for the herbs you recommended for a four-servings pasta dish?<p class=message>I would suggest using 1/2 teaspoon of each herb for a classic Italian taste. Also, be sure to saute the herbs in olive oil for a few minutes before adding them to the pasta to release their full flavor.<p class="message sent">That's great. Thank you so much! I'll definitely give your suggestions a try and let you know how it turns out.<p class=message>You're very welcome! I hope your customers will love your new dishes. Don't hesitate to contact me again if you need any further assistance.<p class="message sent">Thanks again! Have a great day.<p class=message>You too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9b597003-d728-4b7b-9570-f7d38cf6dda8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
