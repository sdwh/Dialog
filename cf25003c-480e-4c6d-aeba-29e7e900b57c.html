I am well-prepared for any battles that come our way.<p class=message>Glad to hear that. By the way, have you heard about the rumors of a dragon guarding the scroll?<p class="message sent">A dragon? That's a formidable foe. But, where there is great risk, there is also great reward.<p class=message>I couldn't have said it better myself. Okay, let's start our journey then, shall we?<p class="message sent">First, we need to determine our strategy.

They might have some insights or clues that can lead us to the scroll.<p class="message sent">Excellent idea! Let's go ask around and see if anyone has information about the scroll or the dragon.<p class=message>Also, always remember to stay alert and watch each other's backs. We need to be cautious of any potential traps or ambushes.<p class="message sent">Noted. This is going to be an exciting adventure! I can't wait to see what lies ahead.<p class=message>Agreed.
