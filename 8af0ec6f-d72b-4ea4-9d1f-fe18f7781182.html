Ready to make some yummy BBQ?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing great! Yes, I am definitely ready to serve some delicious smoked meats to our customers.<p class=message>Awesome! That's what we're here for. Do you have any suggestions on what we should recommend to our customers?<p class="message sent">Well, I think our brisket is a must-try item. It's been smoked for 12 hours and melts in your mouth!<p class=message>Agreed! And don't forget about our ribs. They fall off the bone and are coated in our homemade BBQ sauce.<p class="message sent">Oh yes, the sauce is definitely what makes them stand out. Have you tried our new jalapeno sausage?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's so special about it?<p class="message sent">It's got a kick of spice that really complements the smoky flavor. Perfect for spice lovers!<p class=message>Sounds like a winner. By the way, have you seen the new smoker we got?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's going to help us produce even better smoked meats.<p class=message>Speaking of which, the rack of ribs in the smoker is ready to come out. Can you help me grab it?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Let's get it out and start serving our hungry customers!<p class=message>Great idea. By the way, did you hear that our restaurant was recently voted the best BBQ spot in Austin?<p class="message sent">No way, that's amazing! I knew our food was good, but now we have official recognition.<p class=message>Yes, it's definitely something to be proud of. Let's keep up the good work and make sure every customer leaves here satisfied.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's our passion to create the best BBQ experience for everyone who visits.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8aef3519-9aa6-47f6-8b40-552ac75ec99f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
