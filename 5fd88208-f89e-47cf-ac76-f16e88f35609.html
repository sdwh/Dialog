How can you assist us?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm a car rental staff. I'd love to help. What kind of car would you like to rent?<p class=message>Well, my clients are a family of four looking to travel around Melbourne for a week. They were thinking a mid-size SUV would be ideal.<p class="message sent">Fantastic. We have several choices in that category. What are some of their must-see destinations?<p class=message>They would like to see the Great Ocean Road and Phillip Island, and of course visit the Melbourne Zoo.<p class="message sent">Those are great choices. I highly recommend taking the coastal route along the Great Ocean Road. It's absolutely stunning.<p class=message>Yes, that was one of my recommendations too. How about any food recommendations for them?<p class="message sent">There are so many great restaurants and cafes in Melbourne! The famous Queen Victoria Market is a must-visit for food lovers. My personal favorite is Movida, which serves excellent tapas.<p class=message>I'll definitely recommend that to them. How about driving tips for first-time visitors?<p class="message sent">Drivers in Melbourne drive on the left side of the road, so it may take some getting used to. Make sure to always wear your seatbelt and obey all traffic laws.<p class=message>Thank you for your help! This will definitely make their trip much more enjoyable.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. It's great to see visitors enjoy our beautiful city. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5fcebe4a-4576-4070-94c1-fc64f8d9f5ef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
