Looks like we're in for a busy night at the night market.<p class="message sent message-content">You got that right! I'm ready to fire up the grill and get cookin' some delicious Japanese BBQ.<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, and our customers are in for a treat. We've got some fantastic cuts of meat to grill and skewer.<p class="message sent message-content">That's right. We've got wagyu, pork belly, chicken, and even some vegetables for our vegetarian friends.<p class="message received message-content">I heard the word on the street is that our yakitori is to die for.<p class="message sent message-content">It definitely is! But I think our beef skewers are a close second, and don't even get me started on our butter-soaked corn.<p class="message received message-content">I couldn't agree more. You know, speaking of yakitori, can you remind me what the stick colors mean again?<p class="message sent message-content">Sure thing, boss. The white sticks are for chicken, green sticks are for vegetable skewers, and blue sticks are for seafood.<p class="message received message-content">Ah, that's right. And what about those red sticks?<p class="message sent message-content">Those are special sticks. We use them for our premium cuts of beef and pork.<p class="message received message-content">Good to know. I think I'll have to splurge tonight and try one of those red-sticked skewers.<p class="message sent message-content">I highly recommend it. Trust me, the taste is worth every penny.<p class="message received message-content">Speaking of money, we should consider increasing our prices. Our food is just that good.<p class="message sent message-content">Haha, I like the way you think. But let's wait and see if our customers keep coming back for more first.<p class="message received message-content">Fair enough. Well, I'm ready to get started. Let's give our customers the best Japanese BBQ they've ever had.<p class="message sent message-content">Let's do it! Time to get grilling.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=02077331-23b5-4980-b794-6ffd12e5c30b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
