Looks like we've got a lot of work to do today.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we've got a full house tonight. The customers have been raving about our pork leg vermicelli and pineapple cakes.<p class=message>I'm definitely excited to start cooking. Have you tried these dishes before?<p class="message sent">Of course! They're local favorites, and they're always a hit with our customers. We've got to make sure they're up to our standards.<p class=message>I know our regulars are very demanding! (laughs)<p class="message sent">Oh, and speaking of demanding... Some people are asking if we can make some variations to the dishes. What do you think?<p class=message>Well, we can always experiment a bit, but we've got to be careful not to stray too far from the traditional recipes.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Let's stick to what we know works and maybe add some twists later if there's interest.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Oh, and speaking of twists... what do you think about trying a new sauce for the pork leg vermicelli?<p class="message sent">That could be interesting. Do you have any ideas?<p class=message>How about a spicy peanut sauce? It could add some extra depth to the dish.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that could work. Let's give it a try and see how it goes.<p class=message>And for the pineapple cakes, I was thinking of adding some dried cranberries for an American touch.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's creative. Let's try it out and see if our customers enjoy this mix of cultures.<p class=message>Absolutely. I'm also excited to see how they'll respond to our new menu items.<p class="message sent">Same here. Whatever happens, we'll make sure to always prioritize quality and customer satisfaction.<p class=message>Agreed! Let's get to work and make sure we hit it out of the ballpark tonight.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cd3d375d-e0fc-404e-aa19-1c3118fe092d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
