I'm your guide for today. My name is Tracy. What's your name?<p class="message sent">Hi Tracy, I'm John. Nice to meet you!<p class=message>Nice to meet you too, John. Let's start our tour then. Melbourne is the capital city of Victoria and it's known for its vibrant culture and history. Are you ready to learn more about Australian history?<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely! I'm excited to know more about this country.<p class=message>Great! Our first stop is Federation Square, where we can see an outdoor amphitheatre and a public art space. This place also commemorates Australia's federation in 1901.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's interesting! How long did it take for the whole country to become united?<p class=message>Australia was made up of six colonies before it became one in 1901. It took a lot of negotiation and agreement between the colonies to form the Commonwealth of Australia.<p class="message sent">That's impressive! What else can we see here in Melbourne?<p class=message>We can also visit the Melbourne Museum, which showcases Australia's natural and cultural heritage. Another must-visit place is the Royal Botanic Gardens, where you can see a wide variety of flora and fauna.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great place to take photos! What about food? Is there any local specialty that I should try?<p class=message>Definitely! Melbourne is famous for its coffee, so you should try some while you're here. We also have some iconic dishes like fish and chips, meat pies and lamingtons.<p class="message sent">Yum! I can't wait to taste them. Thank you, Tracy, for showing me around and sharing all these interesting facts.<p class=message>You're welcome, John. It was my pleasure. I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay here in Melbourne.
