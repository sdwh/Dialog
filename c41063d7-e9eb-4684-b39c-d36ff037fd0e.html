Where are you headed today?<p class="message sent">Hey! I'm going to the Victoria Market. It's my first time there. Have you been there before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's a great place to shop for fresh produce and souvenirs. Have you tasted their doughnuts? They're amazing!<p class="message sent">Oh really? I definitely want to taste them. Do you have a favorite vendor you recommend?<p class=message>Yes, I usually go to the American Doughnut Kitchen. They have really good jam-filled ones. What's the occasion for your visit?<p class="message sent">Nothing special, really. It's just that everyone always talks about the Victoria Market, so I wanted to check it out for myself.<p class=message>I see. Well, I hope you have a great time. Melbourne has a lot of amazing things to offer.<p class="message sent">I know, I've been discovering that more and more each day. How long have you lived here?<p class=message>I've been living here for almost 10 years now. It's a great city, and I love driving around exploring different neighborhoods.<p class="message sent">That's really cool. I've only been here for a few days, but I can already see why people say Melbourne is one of the best cities in the world.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's got great food, beautiful architecture, and a really interesting culture. Have you gone to any museums or galleries yet?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I went to the National Gallery of Victoria yesterday. It was amazing. I loved seeing all the art and the beautiful architecture inside the building.<p class=message>That's great. I'm glad you're enjoying your time here. Don't forget to visit the beaches too. St. Kilda Beach is my personal favorite.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tip. I'll definitely check it out if I have time. Is it far from here?<p class=message>Not too far. It's about a 15-minute drive from the city. You can also take the tram there if you prefer.<p class="message sent">Awesome. Thanks for being such a helpful driver and guide.<p class=message>No problem at all. It's my pleasure to share the best of Melbourne with visitors like you. Enjoy the market!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c40e18e3-1d9f-482f-92ff-d22bc8322fab.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
