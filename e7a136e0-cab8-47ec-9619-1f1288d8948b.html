I'm excited to work with you on testing out some new recipes for our bakery products.<p class="message sent">Hi A! Nice to meet you. I'm always stoked to try out new recipes, especially when it involves baking.<p class=message>Me too! So I've been working on this new formula for a healthier version of our bestselling chocolate chip cookies.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that sounds interesting. What have you changed from the original formula?<p class=message>I've swapped out some of the sugar for applesauce and used almond flour instead of regular flour. I've also added a bit of cinnamon for extra flavor.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a good combo. Let's give it a try and see how it turns out.<p class=message>Sure thing. I'll mix the dry ingredients while you prepare the wet mix.<p class="message sent">Perfect. I think the key to any good cookie is the right balance of wet and dry ingredients.<p class=message>Exactly. And having the oven preheated to the right temperature is important too.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's slide these babies into the oven and try not to drool over the smell.<p class=message>Haha I'll try. So while we wait, what's your favorite thing to bake?<p class="message sent">Hmm tough question. I think I love making croissants the most. There's just something satisfying about the process of laminating the dough.<p class=message>I've always been too intimidated to try making croissants. Maybe you can teach me how sometime?<p class="message sent">Of course! We can have a croissant-making day. It'll be fun.<p class=message>That sounds like a blast. But first, let's check on these cookies. Oh wow, they look perfect!<p class="message sent">They smell amazing too. Let's try one out. *takes a bite* Mmm, these are actually really good!<p class=message>I'm so glad you like them. I think these will be a hit with our customers.<p class="message sent">I agree. And I can't wait for our next baking session. Maybe we can even try out some of your croissant recipes.<p class=message>Yes please! I'm excited to bake with you again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e79dd216-98fa-4a97-b7d8-a9f6279cb8b4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
