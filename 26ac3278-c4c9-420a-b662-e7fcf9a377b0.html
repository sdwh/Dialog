How do you think that will affect our flight schedule?<p class="message sent">It could definitely cause some delays, especially if the showers become thunderstorms. We'll have to keep an eye on those.<p class=message>I can imagine. Do you have any tips for how we can handle potential turbulence during flights?<p class="message sent">In general, you should stay seated with your seatbelt on whenever possible, in case the plane hits unexpected turbulence. But thankfully, most of our aircrafts are designed to handle turbulence well.<p class=message>That's good to know. By the way, have you seen any interesting weather phenomena recently?<p class="message sent">Actually, we recently had a rare fallstreak hole formation in the clouds. It was quite a sight to see!<p class=message>Wow, I'm jealous! I would love to see something like that.<p class="message sent">Yes, it was quite a unique experience. Maybe you'll have a chance to experience one yourself someday.<p class=message>Hopefully! Well, thank you for all the information. I'll be sure to keep it in mind as I prepare for my upcoming flights.<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to help out. Have a good day!<p class=message>You too, take care.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=26a546c6-5776-439d-84fe-960992eca6ef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
