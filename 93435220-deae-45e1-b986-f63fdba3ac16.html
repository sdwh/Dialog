I'm excited to talk about our publishing plans.<p class="message sent">Yes, me too! So, what genre are you thinking of for your next book?<p class=message>I was thinking of trying my hand at a romance novel. It's a bit outside my usual style, but I think it could be fun.<p class="message sent">That sounds great! Romance novels are very popular right now. Have you thought about a title?<p class=message>I'm tossing around a few ideas, but nothing stuck yet. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">How about "Love in the Time of Quarantine"? It's a modern twist on an old classic.<p class=message>I love it! That's perfect for the current social climate. Now, what about the cover?<p class="message sent">We could have a couple in masks holding hands, with a city skyline in the background. It would be cute and topical.<p class=message>Brilliant! And what about the blurb on the back?<p class="message sent">We should keep it brief but intriguing. How about, "In a year of isolation, two strangers find love in unexpected ways. Can their connection survive the pandemic?"<p class=message>I'm sold. Let's do it! Do we need to make any revisions to the manuscript itself?<p class="message sent">Just a few tweaks, but nothing major. We'll work with one of our editors to make sure everything is polished.<p class=message>Thanks so much for your help! I can't wait to see the finished product.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. I have a feeling this is going to be a hit. Let's get started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=933bc279-8a6d-4040-adc0-bcab429aa56e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
