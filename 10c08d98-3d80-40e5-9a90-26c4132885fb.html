How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, A. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks. So, I was thinking about one of our patients who's been having some side effects from their medication.<p class="message sent">Oh, which patient are you referring to?<p class=message>The one with high blood pressure. I was thinking of adjusting their medication to see if we can eliminate some of these side effects.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. Do you want to increase the dose or change to a different medication?<p class=message>I think we should start by increasing the dose and see how the patient responds.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll make a note of that. Any other patients we need to adjust medication for?<p class=message>Yes, actually. There's also a patient who's been experiencing nausea from their medication. I was thinking of adding a medication to help with that.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I'll go ahead and prepare the new prescriptions.<p class=message>Thanks, B. You're a lifesaver.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's all in a day's work.<p class=message>By the way, have you watched any good shows recently?<p class="message sent">Yes, I just finished watching "Stranger Things" on Netflix. It was amazing.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard great things about that show. I'll have to check it out.<p class="message sent">Definitely do! The characters are really likable and the storyline is super intriguing.<p class=message>Sounds perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Thanks for the recommendation, B. You're a great pharmacist and a great friend.<p class="message sent">Aw, thank you, A! You're not so bad yourself.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=10be215a-a052-44df-8c2f-a24c307ea611.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
