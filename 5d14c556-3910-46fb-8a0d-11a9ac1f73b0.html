How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing good too. So, what's on the menu for today?<p class="message sent">We have a new dish, it's a grilled salmon with a side of mashed sweet potato and saut√©ed spinach.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. And how about the desserts?<p class="message sent">We have a new apple pie recipe that I'm really excited about. It's served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds amazing. I'm sure it'll be a hit with our guests.<p class="message sent">I hope so! I've also been working on a new cupcake flavor. It's a lemon raspberry cupcake with cream cheese frosting.<p class=message>Wow, you're really stepping up our dessert game. I can't wait to try it.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you're excited about it. By the way, have you tried the new cappuccino machine in the lobby?<p class=message>No, I haven't. How is it?<p class="message sent">It's great! The foam is really creamy and smooth. You should give it a try.<p class=message>I definitely will. Thanks for the recommendation. Oh, and speaking of coffee, we need to order more espresso beans.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I already placed an order yesterday. Everything should arrive by tomorrow.<p class=message>You're always one step ahead. That's why you're the best pastry chef in the city.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Thank you, but I couldn't do it without your management skills.<p class=message>You're too kind. Now, let's make sure our guests have a memorable dining experience today.<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it. I'll get started on the desserts right away.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5d1312a2-b448-4944-8736-c4e363f5e828.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
