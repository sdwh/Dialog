How's it going?<p class="message sent message-content">Not too bad, A. How about you?<p class="message received message-content">Can't complain. Business has been good lately.<p class="message sent message-content">That's great to hear. Our grilled sandwiches are getting quite popular too.<p class="message received message-content">Oh yeah, I tried one the other day. It was delicious.<p class="message sent message-content">Glad you enjoyed it! Speaking of which, do you think we should add some new menu items?<p class="message received message-content">Hmm, good idea. What about adding some grilled veggies or tofu for our vegetarian customers?<p class="message sent message-content">Excellent suggestion. And maybe we could try a new sauce for the meats too.<p class="message received message-content">Yes, let's ask some customers for feedback and see what they'd like to see on the menu.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds good to me. By the way, have you tried the new spices I brought in for the bread dough?<p class="message received message-content">No, not yet. Mind if I give them a try?<p class="message sent message-content">Of course, go ahead. They add a nice kick of flavor to the bread.<p class="message received message-content">Mmm, this is really tasty. I think our customers will love this.<p class="message sent message-content">I'm glad you think so too. It's always fun to experiment with new ingredients.<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely. That's what keeps the customers coming back for more.<p class="message sent message-content">And the fact that we're located by this beautiful beach doesn't hurt either.<p class="message received message-content">Ha! You're right about that. Can't beat the view while enjoying some delicious eats.<p class="message sent message-content">Couldn't agree more. Well, time to get back to baking. See you later, A.<p class="message received message-content">Catch you later, B. Keep up the great work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=07eac706-42ee-49ba-9f12-3046265ec17f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
