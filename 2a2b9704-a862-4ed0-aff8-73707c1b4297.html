I read that it is used to protect information from getting stolen.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct. It is a security standard that ensures the confidentiality of the data through encryption.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds fancy, but what does encryption even mean?<p class="message sent">To put it simply, encryption is like having a secret code that only the authorized persons can decipher, making it difficult for unauthorized people to access the data.<p class=message>That makes sense. So, is ISO 27001 Encryption Key like a superhero for our confidential data?<p class="message sent">Haha, you could say that! It's like our data's security guard, always keeping a close eye on our information.<p class=message>You know what they say, with great power comes great responsibility! I'm glad we have ISO 27001 Encryption Key to protect us!<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And because it's a standard, we can trust that it's being implemented correctly and efficiently.<p class=message>It's like having our own personal bodyguard for our data, cool!<p class="message sent">Yes, with ISO 27001 Encryption Key, we can rest easy knowing that our information is in good hands.<p class=message>You know what would be cool? If we could give our Encryption Key a name, like how people name their cars or pets.<p class="message sent">Hahaha, that's a fun idea! We could name it The Protector, or The Iron Key.<p class=message>I like The Protector! It definitely suits our hero Encryption Key. Thanks for explaining everything, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to talk tech with you!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a2a690b-d322-418f-99eb-5f1a3191c7bf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
