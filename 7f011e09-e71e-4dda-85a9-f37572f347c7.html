I'm excited to have you here to learn how to make authentic Thai red braised pork and side dishes.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A! I'm eager to learn some new cooking techniques and experience the flavors of Thai cuisine.<p class=message>Great! So, let's get started. First, we'll need to gather all of the necessary ingredients. Do you know where we can find some of the unique spices and herbs used in Thai cooking?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not quite sure. I normally cook Chinese dishes.<p class=message>No problem at all. We can take a quick trip to the local market and I'll show you where to find everything we need.<p class="message sent">That sounds like fun and an opportunity to try some new ingredients.<p class=message>Absolutely! Now, let's talk about the recipe. It's important to use the right cooking techniques to achieve the perfect texture and flavor.<p class="message sent">I agree. What are some of the traditional cooking techniques used in Thai cuisine?<p class=message>One of the most common techniques is stir-frying with high heat to lock in the flavors and retain the crisp texture of the ingredients. We'll also need to do a lot of slow-cooking for the braised pork, so it's tender and juicy.<p class="message sent">I'm already getting hungry just thinking about it.<p class=message>Speaking of hunger, let's take a quick break and have some Thai iced tea. It's a refreshing drink that will tide us over until we start cooking.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. Cheers to learning new cooking skills and experiencing delicious Thai cuisine!<p class=message>Cheers indeed! Okay, let's finish our tea and get back to work. I can't wait for you to try the finished product.<p class="message sent">Me too, A! Thanks for taking the time to teach me how to make this amazing dish.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7effa14f-ef0c-40f0-b287-ee7129559047.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
