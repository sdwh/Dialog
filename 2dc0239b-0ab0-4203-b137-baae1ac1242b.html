What are you baking?<p class="message sent">Hi, Mom! I'm making chocolate cupcakes. Do you want to help?<p class=message>Of course, darling! Let me grab my apron. So, what's the recipe?<p class="message sent">It's pretty easy. We just need flour, sugar, cocoa powder, eggs, milk, oil, and baking powder.<p class=message>It sounds simple enough. What's our next step?<p class="message sent">We have to mix the dry ingredients first, before adding the wet ones. Would you like to sift the flour and cocoa powder while I measure the sugar and baking powder?<p class=message>Sure thing, honey! *starts sifting* So, how was school today?<p class="message sent">It was good. My English teacher gave us a pop quiz and it wasn't that bad.<p class=message>That's great to hear! You know English is important if you want to travel abroad someday.<p class="message sent">Yup, I've been practicing with my online tutor every week. And speaking of travel, can we go to Paris together next summer?<p class=message>Hmm, that's a great idea! We can sample lots of yummy pastries and visit the famous landmarks. *smells the cocoa* Oops, we better not burn the cupcakes.<p class="message sent">Right! They look perfect now. Let's wait for them to cool down before frosting.<p class=message>I can't wait to try them! Speaking of frosting, which do you prefer: vanilla or chocolate?<p class="message sent">Hmm, difficult choice. Let's make half of them vanilla and the other half chocolate.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! *preps the frosting* Now, let's decorate the cupcakes with sprinkles and marshmallows.<p class="message sent">Yay! This is the best part. Thanks, Mom, for baking with me.<p class=message>No problem, my dear. Spending time with you is always a pleasure. And these cupcakes are going to be a hit at school tomorrow!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2dbb9bf6-7d32-4e09-8be8-daf3c66c33ae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
