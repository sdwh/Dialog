Just trying to come up with ways to streamline our production.<p class=message>Have you thought about implementing machine vision technology?<p class="message sent">Actually, yeah. I'm a bit unfamiliar with it though. What's your experience with it?<p class=message>I'm a machine vision engineer, so it's kind of my bread and butter. We could use it to automate a lot of the quality control processes, like checking for defects and making sure everything is in the right place.<p class="message sent">That sounds like it could save us a lot of time and money. What kind of hardware would we need to set up?<p class=message>Well, we'd need cameras and some kind of processing unit, like a computer or a specialized controller. I can help you with the specifics.<p class="message sent">Awesome, thanks. What kind of software would we use to program it?<p class=message>There are a lot of different options, but I recommend something like OpenCV. It's open-source and has a lot of functionality.<p class="message sent">I'll look into it. Do you think it'll be hard to train the system to recognize different parts and defects?<p class=message>It can be a bit challenging, but the more data we collect and feed into the system, the better it'll get at recognizing things. We just have to be patient and keep tweaking it.<p class="message sent">Gotcha. Well, it sounds like it's worth a shot. Thanks for the insight!<p class=message>No problem. Let me know if you need any help setting everything up.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ceb199ad-9cdb-402b-a6ac-d36e8e6e2b86.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
