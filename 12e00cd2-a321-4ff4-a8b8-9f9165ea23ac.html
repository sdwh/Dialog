How about you?<p class=message>Not bad. Just trying to figure out how to achieve full test coverage for the upcoming release.<p class="message sent">That's a great goal. Have you identified any areas where we're falling short?<p class=message>Yeah, I've noticed that our regression testing isn't as comprehensive as it could be.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Maybe we could implement some automated regression tests to supplement our manual testing efforts.<p class=message>Definitely. I think automating the repetitive tests will free up our time for more exploratory testing.<p class="message sent">Right. And we can also look into using tools that can help us track our test coverage by showing which areas have already been tested and which ones still need attention.<p class=message>That's a good idea. It would give us a better understanding of where we stand in terms of test coverage.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And it will also help us prioritize our testing efforts and ensure that we're not overlooking any critical areas.<p class=message>Agreed. I think we're on the right track. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class="message sent">Well, we could also consider involving more people in our testing efforts, like our developers and designers, to get additional perspectives and uncover any blind spots.<p class=message>Yes, collaboration is key. I'll definitely bring that up at our next team meeting. Thanks for your insights, B.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. Let's work together to achieve that full test coverage!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=12db6c8b-3231-44cd-8269-8f8a7cd22468.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
