Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?<p class="message sent">Sure! My name is B and I'm a professional juggler.<p class=message>That's really cool! So how did you get into juggling?<p class="message sent">I actually started out as a clown, believe it or not. But I realized that juggling was my true talent.<p class=message>And how long have you been juggling for?<p class="message sent">About 10 years now. It's been a wild ride.<p class=message>I can imagine. So what's the most challenging thing about juggling?<p class="message sent">Definitely keeping all of the balls in the air, both literally and figuratively. It takes a lot of focus and practice.<p class=message>I bet. Have you ever dropped a ball during a performance?<p class="message sent">Oh, of course. It happens to the best of us. But the key is to keep going and not let it throw you off your game.<p class=message>That's great advice. So do you have any upcoming shows that we should know about?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'll actually be performing at a circus next week. It's going to be a lot of fun.<p class=message>Sounds like it! And just one final question - have you ever tried juggling something besides balls?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I once juggled chainsaws in a performance. It was pretty intense.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. Thanks for chatting with me, B. Best of luck with your upcoming show!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e8afeafd-f9be-4f80-97bd-2b1dba7109a4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
