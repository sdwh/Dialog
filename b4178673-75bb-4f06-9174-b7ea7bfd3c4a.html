Welcome to our restaurant.<p class="message sent">Hi there, I'm the sake bartender. It's great to have you as a team member.<p class=message>Yeah, let's work together to serve our customers the best sushi and sake they've ever had.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What's your favorite sushi roll to make?<p class=message>I love making the dragon roll. It's a bit challenging, but the presentation is so beautiful.<p class="message sent">Nice choice. As for sake, have you had our premium selection yet?<p class=message>Oh yes, I must say the Junmai Daiginjo is my favorite. The taste is smooth with a hint of floral aroma.<p class="message sent">That's my favorite too! We have great taste. *laughs*<p class=message>*laughs* Definitely. So, have you ever tried making sushi yourself?<p class="message sent">I have, actually. It's not easy, but it's a lot of fun.<p class=message>Yes, it takes practice, but once you get the hang of it, it's quite satisfying.<p class="message sent">I totally agree. It's also interesting to see different sushi trends around the world.<p class=message>Right, I've seen some unique sushi rolls with uncommon ingredients. Have you tried any?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've tried sushi with foie gras and even gold leaves on top. *laughs*<p class=message>Wow, that's fancy. We should start experimenting with new flavors and ingredients.<p class="message sent">Yes, let's spice things up a bit. Speaking of spice, have you ever had sake with wasabi?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it good?<p class="message sent">It's definitely an acquired taste. Some people love it, some hate it. You should try it and see for yourself.<p class=message>Okay, challenge accepted. *laughs*<p class="message sent">This is going to be fun. We make a great team, wouldn't you say?<p class=message>Absolutely, let's keep serving up some delicious sushi and sake!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b4158785-1379-41af-b5b5-fae5c2bb3581.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
