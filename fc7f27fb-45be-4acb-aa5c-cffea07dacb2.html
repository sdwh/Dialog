How about you?<p class=message>Same here, just making sure everything is set up. So, how did you get into acting?<p class="message sent">Well, I've always loved performing, so I started doing school plays and community theater when I was younger.<p class=message>That's cool. Any favorite roles you've played?<p class="message sent">Definitely Juliet in Romeo and Juliet. It's such a classic story and I loved the challenge of bringing the character to life.<p class=message>Nice! Speaking of challenges, how do you handle the pressure on set?<p class="message sent">I try not to overthink it too much and just focus on the task at hand. Plus, having a supportive cast and crew really helps.<p class=message>Couldn't agree more. Have you seen any good movies lately?<p class="message sent">Yes! I recently watched Parasite and it totally blew me away. Have you seen it?<p class=message>Yes, I loved it! Do you have any favorite movie genres?<p class="message sent">I'm a sucker for romantic comedies. There's just something about them that always puts me in a good mood.<p class=message>Haha, I get that. Alright, looks like it's time to get back to work. Good luck on your scene!<p class="message sent">Thanks, you too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fc7bb3d3-4506-412a-8fcf-d70e40e6854a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
