How's everything going with the drinks tonight, B?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It's been busy, but I'm loving it. People seem to be really enjoying our new cocktail menu.<p class=message>That's great to hear! I've noticed a lot of good reviews on social media lately. What's been the most popular drink so far?<p class="message sent">The "Phra Khanong Sunset" has been a hit. It's made with fresh mango juice, tequila, and a dash of ginger syrup.<p class=message>Oh, I'll have to try that one for myself! And how about the small plates? Any standout dishes?<p class="message sent">Definitely the pork belly bao buns. We've had people ordering multiple rounds of those.<p class=message>Yum, those are a personal favorite of mine too. So, speaking of new things, have you been thinking of any other drinks we could add to the menu?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was playing around with a blueberry and lavender syrup. I was thinking maybe we could pair it with some gin and Prosecco.<p class=message>Sounds intriguing! Let's test it out tomorrow during happy hour and see what our customers think.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Oh, and by the way, have you seen the new bartender that just started working next door?<p class=message>No, I haven't yet. Any good?<p class="message sent">Yeah, she seems really talented. And she suggested we do a joint promotion next week to bring in more business.<p class=message>That's a great idea! I'll go talk to her tomorrow and we can start planning it out.<p class="message sent">Awesome, I'm excited to see what we come up with!<p class=message>Me too. Thanks for all your hard work, B. Let's make this bar and restaurant the talk of the town!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ea84bf6a-624d-4f8a-987c-fdab0b0ec4da.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
