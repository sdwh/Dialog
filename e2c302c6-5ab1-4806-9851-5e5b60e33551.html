How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, A. Just busy flipping these delicious meats on the grill. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. Grilling seems to be everyone's favorite pastime these days, doesn't it?<p class="message sent">That's right! Though I have to admit, I actually prefer the challenge of cooking up some perfectly seasoned vegetables.<p class=message>Vegetables? Ha! You're a rare breed, B. Most people only come to my restaurant for the meat.<p class="message sent">Well, I think veggies deserve some love too. Speaking of which, have you tried that new eggplant dish we're serving?<p class=message>Can't say I have. I guess I'm more of a classic grilled steak kind of guy.<p class="message sent">Fair enough. But take my word for it, that eggplant is to die for.<p class=message>Maybe I'll give it a try sometime. While we're on the subject of delicious food, have you heard about that fancy new fusion restaurant that just opened down the street?<p class="message sent">You mean the one with the chef who's famous for blending Korean and Italian cuisine? Yeah, I've heard great things.<p class=message>Same here. I'm really curious to see how he works his magic in the kitchen.<p class="message sent">Me too. Maybe we should go there together one of these days, if we ever have a free night.<p class=message>Absolutely! But in the meantime, I'd say we've got our hands full with all these hungry customers.<p class="message sent">No doubt about it. Let's get back to cooking.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e2be08fb-bf11-44ba-9524-2cb720e5d1ee.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
