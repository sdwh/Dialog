So, what treasures did you bring me today, B?<p class="message sent">Ah, morning A! I've got some freshly-caught sea bass, mackerel, and prawns just for you.<p class=message>Oh, lovely! Sea bass is one of my favourites. Can't wait to see what the chef will whip up with these.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I also managed to get some exotic scallops if you're interested.<p class=message>Exotic, you say? I love trying new things. How about we make a special dish with it tonight?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. And have you tried the oysters from that new supplier I recommended last time?<p class=message>I sure did. And let me tell you, they did not disappoint. The customers loved them.<p class="message sent">Glad to hear that. I always want to make sure you have the best selection.<p class=message>And you never fail to impress. It's always a pleasure doing business with you.<p class="message sent">You flatter me, A. It's just good teamwork that keeps our customers happy.<p class=message>Speaking of which, how about we grab a quick bite for lunch? The seafood here is always so fresh and delicious.<p class="message sent">I was just thinking the same thing! Let's go try out that new sashimi place.<p class=message>Perfect. And maybe we can brainstorm some new menu ideas over lunch too.<p class="message sent">Can't wait. This is why I love working with you, A. It's not just about business, it's also about enjoying what we do.<p class=message>Absolutely, B. When you love what you do, it shows in the quality of your work. And in our case, the quality of the seafood too.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well said, my friend. Let's go get some lunch and keep the good vibes going.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=538a5b70-043c-4b39-a42d-553fd8b6d63b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
