Do you need any help with wine selections tonight?<p class="message sent">Yes, thank you. We have a couple celebrating their anniversary tonight, and they would like some wine to complement their meal.<p class=message>Great. What dishes will they be having?<p class="message sent">They ordered a lobster tail with a side of grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes.<p class=message>For seafood, I would recommend a dry white wine to bring out the flavors of the lobster. Perhaps a Chardonnay or a Sauvignon Blanc would do the trick?<p class="message sent">Sounds good. How about for their side dishes?<p class=message>Since they're having mashed potatoes, a more buttery wine would be perfect. I suggest a Pinot Noir. As for the vegetables, a crisp ros√© would be ideal.<p class="message sent">Thank you for your suggestions. Can you recommend any sparkling wines for them to celebrate with?<p class=message>Of course! In honor of their anniversary, I recommend a Champagne or a Prosecco. They are light and festive, perfect for a celebration.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your help! I'll share your suggestions with the customers.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your evening!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3c61073c-02e9-467f-9a2f-cf4c44cbca2f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
