What are you up to today, B?<p class="message sent">Hi mom! I'm feeling a bit bored, so I was thinking of baking some cupcakes. Do you want to join me?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds like fun! What kind of cupcakes do you want to make?<p class="message sent">How about we make chocolate cupcakes with vanilla frosting? Those are my favorite!<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let's gather the ingredients and get started.<p class="message sent">Okay, let me get the recipe. Hmm, it says we need flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, milk, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract.<p class=message>I think we have all those ingredients in the pantry. Let's check.<p class="message sent">Great! Now we just need to mix everything together and put it in the oven.<p class=message>Don't forget the cupcakes liners! We don't want them to stick to the pan.<p class="message sent">Oh right, good catch mom! You're always on top of things.<p class=message>That's what moms are for, sweetie. Now let's get baking!<p class="message sent">Yay! This is going to be so much fun.<p class=message>I can't wait to try them. Do you think we should add some sprinkles on top?<p class="message sent">Oh definitely, that'll make them even better.<p class=message>Okay, cupcakes are ready! Let's wait for them to cool down and then we can put on the frosting and sprinkles.<p class="message sent">This was so much fun. I love baking with you mom.<p class=message>Me too, B. It's always nice spending time together and creating something delicious. Let's go enjoy our cupcakes now!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2cdb38af-269a-4a89-9bd2-3c1e5e62a540.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
