How about you?<p class=message>Not bad, just trying to work through some code here in Visual Studio.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it can be a bit overwhelming at times, but once you get the hang of it, it's really powerful.<p class=message>Agreed, I'm actually really enjoying working with it. Have you tried out any of the new features in the latest update?<p class="message sent">I haven't yet, what kind of features are you talking about?<p class=message>Well, they've added some new debugging tools and also improved the search functionality.<p class="message sent">Oh nice, that could definitely come in handy. Speaking of tools, have you tried out the extension I recommended last week?<p class=message>I did and it's been a lifesaver. Thanks again for that suggestion.<p class="message sent">No problem. Hey, did you hear that the office is getting a new coffee machine next week?<p class=message>Really? That's great news. I've been surviving on instant coffee for too long now.<p class="message sent">Same here. I'm pretty excited to try out the new espresso machine they're getting.<p class=message>Me too. Maybe we can take a coffee break together and test it out.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. But let's finish up this code first, I'm feeling pretty productive today.<p class=message>Agreed, let's buckle down and get this done. We can reward ourselves with some caffeine afterwards.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Alright, back to coding!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9d1f07b4-e760-4a36-9fc7-63ed53bfa022.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
