How's it going with the deliveries today?<p class="message sent">Pretty good so far. It's a bit busy, but I'm managing.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Make sure to double-check the orders before heading out.<p class="message sent">Of course! I don't want to be responsible for any mix-ups.<p class=message>Speaking of mix-ups, have you had any funny encounters with customers?<p class="message sent">Actually, yeah. One guy asked for extra chili flakes, then called back to complain that it was too spicy.<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious. You can't please everyone, I guess.<p class="message sent">Definitely not. But I try my best. How do you deal with difficult customers?<p class=message>Patience is key. I always try to listen to their concerns and find a solution.<p class="message sent">That's a good approach. I'll keep it in mind. So, do you have any plans after work?<p class=message>Not really. Just going to head home and binge-watch some Netflix. What about you?<p class="message sent">Same here. Maybe order in some food and kick back.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Hey, speaking of food, have you tried our new dish?<p class="message sent">Which one?<p class=message>The spicy tuna roll. It's amazing.<p class="message sent">Ooh, I haven't yet. Maybe I'll have to order that for myself.<p class=message>Definitely do. And make sure to leave a good review!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Will do.
