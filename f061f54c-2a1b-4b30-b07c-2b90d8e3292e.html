Can I ask your opinion on something?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! What's up?<p class=message>Well, I'm thinking of buying a new phone, but I'm not sure how many I should get.<p class="message sent">How many are you thinking of buying?<p class=message>I was thinking maybe two. One for myself and one as a gift for my sister.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Well, what's your budget like?<p class=message>It's pretty flexible, but I don't want to spend more than I have to.<p class="message sent">Got it. Have you done any research on the phones you're interested in?<p class=message>Yeah, I've been looking at a few different options. I just can't decide which one to go with.<p class="message sent">Well, what are some of the pros and cons you've found so far?<p class=message>The one I like the most has great camera quality, but it's also the most expensive.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's definitely something to consider. Have you thought about going with a slightly cheaper model and getting two instead?<p class=message>That's not a bad idea. Maybe I should look into that more.<p class="message sent">It's worth considering. Plus, your sister might not care as much about the camera quality as you do.<p class=message>True, true. But what if she ends up liking my phone better?<p class="message sent">Then you can just tell her you got the better one because you're the favorite sibling.<p class=message>Haha, I like the way you think. Alright, looks like I'm getting two phones!<p class="message sent">Glad I could help!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f0618f2b-0771-4087-a1e0-3975535e0811.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
