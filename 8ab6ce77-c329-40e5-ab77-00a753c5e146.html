What's up?<p class="message sent">Hey A, not much! Just working on testing for this new e-commerce platform.<p class=message>Oh cool! How's that going?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty well so far, but there's still a lot of testing and bug fixing needed.<p class=message>Yeah, that sounds like a lot of work. What kind of tools are you using for testing?<p class="message sent">Well, we're using automated testing tools like Selenium, as well as manual testing.<p class=message>That makes sense. Have you run into any interesting bugs or issues?<p class="message sent">Yeah, actually one of the weirdest bugs we found was that the submit button wasn't working for users with a certain browser extension enabled.<p class=message>Interesting! How did you even discover that bug?<p class="message sent">Well, we were doing cross-browser testing and noticed that the button wasn't functioning on a specific browser with that extension enabled.<p class=message>That's pretty impressive. It sounds like you're really thorough in your testing process!<p class="message sent">Thanks! We try to cover all our bases to ensure the platform is running smoothly.<p class=message>Totally. How does your team keep track of all the bugs and issues you find during testing?<p class="message sent">We use JIRA to track all the bugs and assign them to the right team members for remediation.<p class=message>Sounds efficient! Have you thought about exploring any other types of testing, like exploratory testing or usability testing?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we've definitely considered it. We're planning to incorporate those kinds of testing in our later phases.<p class=message>Awesome. Well, good luck with the rest of your testing, B!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! It was great chatting with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8ab5da01-eda6-47cf-a1de-6eb7e7b1f0d5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
