Welcome to the concert.<p class="message sent">Thank you. I'm excited to see the show.<p class=message>I can see that. Can I see your ticket and bag, please?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Here's my ticket, and here's my bag.<p class=message>Thanks. Now, can you please open your bag and show me its contents?<p class="message sent">Of course. Here's my water bottle, my phone, some gum, and a few snacks.<p class=message>Great. Everything looks good here. Are you enjoying your time in Brisbane?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. The city is beautiful and people are really friendly.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've been living here for a while, and I love it too.<p class="message sent">How long have you been working as a security officer?<p class=message>I've been doing this for three years now. It's challenging, but also very rewarding.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. I'm sure you get to meet a lot of interesting people.<p class=message>Definitely. It's always interesting to see how different audience members behave during concerts.<p class="message sent">Do people ever try to sneak in things they're not allowed to have?<p class=message>Oh, yes. We've caught people trying to bring in all sorts of things, from drugs to weapons.<p class="message sent">That's scary. I'm glad you're doing your job well and keeping us all safe.<p class=message>It's what we're here for. Have a great time at the concert, ma'am.<p class="message sent">Thanks, you too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=886cb124-b1ad-48e5-bd1c-47491ea8a6d0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
