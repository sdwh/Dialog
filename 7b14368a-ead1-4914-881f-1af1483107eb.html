Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm a cybersecurity expert. Nice to meet you too.<p class=message>So, we're discussing how to protect sensitive financial data and transactions. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Yes, encryption is key. We need to make sure all data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.<p class=message>That makes sense. And what about two-factor authentication?<p class="message sent">Definitely. We should require at least two-factor authentication for any access to sensitive data.<p class=message>What about physical security measures, like biometric scanners or security cameras?<p class="message sent">Those are definitely helpful, but we also need to make sure employees are trained on proper security practices. Human error is often the biggest risk.<p class=message>That's a good point. Speaking of human error, what do you think of phishing scams?<p class="message sent">They're a huge problem. We need to make sure all employees are aware of them and know how to identify and report them.<p class=message>Absolutely. And what about data backups? How often should we be doing those?<p class="message sent">At least once a day, preferably with offsite backups as well. We need to make sure we can recover quickly in the event of a disaster.<p class=message>Got it. Well, it sounds like we have a solid plan in place. Thanks for your expertise!<p class="message sent">Of course, happy to help. Keep up the good work on the backend!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7b140b28-49b1-4ba8-8044-c84d2d7384c5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
