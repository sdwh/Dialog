I'm A, a chef from Taiwan. I'm excited to explore the fish market here in Nagasaki with you.<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm B, your tour guide. Nice to meet you. Nagasaki's fish market is famous for its exquisite seafood. What kind of fish are you interested in purchasing today?<p class=message>I would like to find some fresh tuna and salmon. Can you give me some recommendations?<p class="message sent">Of course! This stall right here is known for their fresh tuna. They get their supply directly from local fishermen early in the morning.<p class=message>Wow, the color and texture of the tuna look amazing. Let's get some. Do you have any tips on cooking tuna?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Grilled or seared tuna is popular in Nagasaki. You can season it with soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. It's simple yet delicious.<p class=message>Sounds perfect. Salmon is also one of my specialties. What do you suggest?<p class="message sent">You can check out that seaweed stall over there. They have fresh and organic seaweed that goes well with salmon. How do you cook your salmon usually?<p class=message>I usually bake it with lemon, olive oil, and herbs. But I'm open to trying new techniques.<p class="message sent">Great! In Nagasaki, they like to serve salmon in a soup with Japanese-style dashi broth and vegetables. Want to give it a try?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds interesting. Let's buy some ingredients for that too.<p class="message sent">OK. Before we leave, I highly recommend trying some local delicacies like Nagasaki-style tempura or sashimi.<p class=message>That sounds like a fantastic idea. Thanks for showing me around the market, B. It's been a pleasure!<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. I hope you enjoy your stay in Nagasaki and share your culinary creations with us.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a56ff72f-b0a0-4efb-a12d-fda597f6f98a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
