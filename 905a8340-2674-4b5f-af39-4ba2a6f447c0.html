My name is A. I'm a solo traveler and I'm exploring Japan.<p class="message sent">Hello A! Welcome to Japan. My name is B, and I am a volunteer tour guide here in Osaka.<p class=message>Nice to meet you, B. I was hoping to experience some of the local culture here in Osaka. Do you know of any interesting places to visit?<p class="message sent">Of course, Osaka is famous for its food, so we can visit Dotonbori and try some of the local delicacies like takoyaki.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard about takoyaki. They're the small octopus fried balls, right? I'm excited to try them.<p class="message sent">Yes, exactly! You should also try Okonomiyaki, which is like a Japanese-style pancake, but with savory ingredients like cabbage, meat, and seafood.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! So, how did you become a volunteer tour guide, B?<p class="message sent">Well, I love sharing my knowledge of Japanese culture with visitors. And it gives me a chance to practice my English, too!<p class=message>That's great. Speaking of Japanese culture, what are some customs that visitors should be aware of when they visit Osaka?<p class="message sent">Well, in Japan, it is customary to bow when you greet someone, and it's considered rude to talk loudly in public areas.<p class=message>Okay. I'll keep that in mind. And what about tipping at restaurants?<p class="message sent">Actually, tipping is not customary in Japan. The Japanese believe that good service is simply part of the job, so they don't expect to be tipped.<p class=message>Wow, that's different than what I'm used to back home. But it's good to know. Thanks for the tips, B.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. I hope you enjoy your time here in Osaka and have a great cultural experience.<p class=message>I think I will, B. Thanks again for showing me around. It was nice meeting you.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, A. Take care and enjoy the rest of your trip.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=905a81ff-1f45-4512-a447-6c6ee4d33d18.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
