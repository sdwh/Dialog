It's nice to finally play a game of Go with you.<p class="message sent">Definitely A! I have been looking forward to this match. How good are you at this game?<p class=message>Let's just say I am no professional, but I know a few tricks up my sleeve.<p class="message sent">Same here. This is one of those games where you can never stop learning.<p class=message>Agreed. It's also one of the oldest board games in history.<p class="message sent">It's amazing how such a simple game can become so complex.. it's all about strategy and planning.<p class=message>Kind of like real life, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What's your favorite strategy in this game?<p class=message>I try to focus on the corners first, then the sides, and lastly the center.<p class="message sent">Interesting! My plan is to create a balanced framework that's hard for my opponent to poke holes through.<p class=message>I like that! Remind me to play against you in real life, once this pandemic is over.<p class="message sent">For sure, A! Then we can grab some bubble tea afterwards.<p class=message>Sounds like a deal! By the way, how do you feel about the recent surge of Go popularity due to a certain Netflix series?<p class="message sent">I am all for it! If more people are interested in this game, then it's a win-win for everyone.<p class=message>Agreed. It's definitely a game worth playing for anyone who loves strategy and board games.<p class="message sent">Indeed it is, A. This has been a great match, let's do it again soon!<p class=message>Absolutely, B. I'll be waiting for the next game!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aed74bb3-fe95-4d9b-adb4-70ae8d0f5f8d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
