And what's the significance of the waterfall?<p class="message sent">It is said that drinking from the waterfall will bring you health, longevity, and success in your studies or career.<p class=message>I definitely need all of those things! *laughs*<p class="message sent">Let me show you around the temple grounds. There are many interesting spots to visit, like the Jishu Shrine and the Otowa waterfall.<p class=message>Sounds great! I'm excited to learn more about the history and culture of Kiyomizu-dera.<p class="message sent">Did you know that the temple's name translates to "pure water temple" in English?<p class=message>Ah, that makes sense with the waterfall and all. Speaking of water, I'm getting a bit thirsty. Is there anywhere to get a drink around here?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's head over to one of the tea houses on the temple grounds for some traditional Japanese tea and snacks.<p class=message>Perfect, that sounds lovely.
