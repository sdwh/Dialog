But honestly, all these tech terms sound like a foreign language to me.<p class=message>I completely understand. But essentially, SOC is just a fancy way of saying a team that monitors and protects a company's computer systems.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. So it's like having the best guard dogs protecting your house from burglars?<p class=message>Exactly! And not just that, it's like having them on a leash too, to make sure they don't bite any friends or family members who come over.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's a really good analogy. But is it really necessary for companies to have a SOC? Can't they just lock all their doors and windows and call it a day?<p class=message>Well, as we say in the tech world, "hackers gonna hack." It's not just about locking the doors and windows, it's about making sure you have the right security cameras and alarms in place too.<p class="message sent">I see what you mean. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to sensitive information and data.<p class=message>Absolutely! And having an ISO 27001 SOC certification means that a company has undergone rigorous testing and auditing to ensure their security measures are up to par with international standards.<p class="message sent">Wow, I never realized how much went into protecting a company's data. Thanks for explaining it to me in a way that I can understand!<p class=message>No problem! And if you ever need a guard dog, I know a couple that won't break the bank.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cd171a08-1a8d-4025-bc46-5b57d49a184f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
