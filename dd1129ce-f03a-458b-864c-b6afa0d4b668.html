Hackers are always one step ahead, and we need to keep up with them.<p class=message>Yeah, that's true. But what do you think of our current security measures?<p class="message sent">I think they're outdated and need a complete overhaul. We need to invest in better technologies and training for our staff.<p class=message>That's a good point. But what about the hackers who are already inside?<p class="message sent">We need to detect and contain them before they cause any damage.<p class=message>Agreed. But how can we do that effectively?<p class="message sent">We need to monitor the network/servers closely and have a response plan in place to mitigate the damage.<p class=message>Sounds like a solid plan. But what about social engineering attacks?<p class="message sent">That's a tough one. We need to train our employees to be cautious and not let their guard down.<p class=message>Yeah, that can be a challenge. But what about our critical infrastructure? Can we protect that?<p class="message sent">We need to make sure it is secure by implementing security measures from physical security to cyber defense.<p class=message>Absolutely. But how do we convince the higher-ups to invest more in cybersecurity?<p class="message sent">We need to make them understand the potential consequences of a breach and how it can affect not just the government but also the citizens.<p class=message>Good point. But can we ever be completely secure?<p class="message sent">Sadly, there is no such thing as 100% security, but we can always reduce the risks by implementing best practices and staying ahead of the game.<p class=message>I like your optimism, B! Let's work together to keep our nation safe.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A! We've got this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dd028429-7d1b-488d-9a18-5bd91505a336.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
