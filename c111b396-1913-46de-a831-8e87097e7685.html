Where are you headed today?<p class=message>I'm going to the Gold Coast in Australia for a vacation. How about you?<p class="message sent">Same here! It's such a beautiful place. Have you been there before?<p class=message>No, it's my first time. I've heard great things about the beaches and attractions.<p class="message sent">That's true. You should definitely check out Surfers Paradise and the theme parks.<p class=message>Yes, I already have tickets to Movie World and Sea World. I'm excited!<p class="message sent">Those are great choices. I'm planning on trying some surfing lessons while I'm there.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds thrilling.

Don't forget to have fun and enjoy the ocean.<p class=message>Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. How long have you been driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for almost 10 years now. It's been a great way to meet different people and see new places.<p class=message>That's awesome. Do you have any favorite places you like to drive to?<p class="message sent">I love the city lights at night, but also enjoy the peaceful scenery at the countryside. What about you?<p class=message>I prefer the beach and coastal areas. The sound of the waves and the salty air is so relaxing.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. We're almost there!
