As we approach the Asakusa Shrine, our knowledgeable guide B will enlighten us with its history and cultural background.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. Hello everyone! So, the Asakusa Shrine was built in the year 628 and is considered one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Japan.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive! I bet a lot has changed here over the years.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! The temple has been destroyed numerous times due to fires and natural disasters, but it was always rebuilt with the help of the locals.<p class=message>It's amazing how resilient and dedicated the people are towards their traditions and culture.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's the Japanese spirit! The temple also features the Kaminarimon, a giant red paper lantern-shaped gate leading to the Nakamise shopping street.<p class=message>Oh, I've seen that on postcards! Is there a meaning behind the lantern?<p class="message sent">Yes, it symbolizes the god of thunder and lightning and represents protection from natural disasters.<p class=message>That makes sense! By the way, do you have any interesting stories about this place?<p class="message sent">Of course! The temple was believed to have a healing power during the Edo period, with people coming here to pray for good health and long life.<p class=message>That's fascinating! It's great to see how faith can bring people together and give them hope.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And there's even a legend that the temple's founder, who was a fisherman, was guided to this place by a golden dragon.<p class=message>Ha! That must be quite a sight. Thank you, B. I learned a lot and enjoyed the stories.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A! And thank you, folks, for choosing our tour. Don't forget to check out the souvenir shops before we leave!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ace3aad0-d09e-4bc1-aa58-461b4aabb50a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
