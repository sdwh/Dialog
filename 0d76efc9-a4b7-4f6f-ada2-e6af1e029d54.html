It's an additional security measure to protect sensitive information.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting. How does it work?<p class=message>Well, you need to log in with two different pieces of information, usually a password and then a code sent to your smartphone.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a pain to log in every time.<p class=message>It might take a little more time, but itâ€™s worth it for the added security. Plus, some 2FA apps let you save your login info for faster access.<p class="message sent">Ah, that's cool. But isn't it possible for hackers to get into my phone and get my login info?<p class=message>That's possible, but still much harder than just stealing a password. And, you can always set a strong password for your phone and enable two-factor authentication on your phone as well.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I see what you mean. But, I think it's just extra work for little benefit.<p class=message>Actually, some companies won't even let you access their sensitive information without 2FA. It's becoming increasingly necessary for security reasons.<p class="message sent">Alright, you've convinced me. I guess I'll start using it then.<p class=message>Great, I'll send you some links to get started. It's easy to set up, and you'll have peace of mind knowing your information is secure.<p class="message sent">Perfect, thank you for telling me about this. I can't believe I never knew about 2FA before!<p class=message>No problem, happy to help keep your information safe.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0d76ddf2-e372-4db0-b373-f421387b93ec.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
