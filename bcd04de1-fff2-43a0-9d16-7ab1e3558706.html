How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, just excited to cook up some delicious steaks tonight.<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing, I'm looking forward to seeing the final product.<p class=message>Our steaks are freshly sourced from a farm right here in Oxfordshire. Have you tried them before?<p class="message sent">No, but I've heard great things about them. Can you recommend a particular cut?<p class=message>Our sirloin is very popular among our regulars, but I would also suggest trying our ribeye.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll keep that in mind. What sides do you recommend to go with the steaks?<p class=message>Our roasted potatoes and grilled asparagus are always popular choices. We also have a delicious truffle mushroom sauce that pairs well with the steaks.<p class="message sent">That all sounds amazing. I'm sure the customers will love it.<p class=message>Speaking of customers, do you have any quirky stories to share from your time serving here at the restaurant?<p class="message sent">Well, one time a customer came in and ordered a burger with no bun. Instead, they wanted two slices of lettuce to sandwich the patty.<p class=message>(laughs) That's definitely unique. I'll have to keep that in mind for future orders.<p class="message sent">How about you? Any interesting stories from the kitchen?<p class=message>Actually, one time we had a couple that ordered their steak blue rare. They wanted it so rare that it basically just needed to be on the grill for a few seconds on each side.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's pretty rare indeed.<p class=message>Yeah, it was definitely a challenge, but we aim to please our customers.<p class="message sent">Well, I'm sure tonight's service will be a success. Let's get to it!<p class=message>Yes, let's make some mouth-watering steaks!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bcce558b-b16f-49d3-9521-84b36a667f07.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
