So, where are the desserts?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm the manager of this restaurant. Nice to meet you, A. The desserts are right over here. What do you think about the presentation?<p class=message>They look amazing! How do you create the designs on the plates?<p class="message sent">Thank you, we use a mix of fruit purees, sauces, and powdered sugar. We also have a few stencils that we use for the more intricate designs.<p class=message>That's interesting. I've never used stencils before. Mind if I try it?<p class="message sent">Of course not! I'd love to learn some new tricks from a master like you.<p class=message>Well, let's see what I can do. *starts working on a plate*<p class="message sent">Wow, that looks fantastic! I can't wait to try it.<p class=message>Thank you, I appreciate it. Hey, what do you think of the design for the restaurant?<p class="message sent">We wanted something modern and refined. The designer we worked with recommended some hanging lights to match the look.<p class=message>It looks great in here. I'm loving the ambiance.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you think so. Hopefully, it will be a hit with our customers.<p class=message>Speaking of customers, what are your top dessert sellers?<p class="message sent">Our top three sellers are crème brûlée, chocolate lava cake, and tiramisu.<p class=message>That's interesting. We have a pumpkin spice macaron that's really popular back in the States.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious. Maybe we could add it to our menu as a seasonal dessert.<p class=message>That could be a great idea. I would love to collaborate with you on some new dessert offerings.<p class="message sent">That would be awesome! We could do a special desserts menu featuring your creations.<p class=message>I'm excited to try it out. What's the next step?<p class="message sent">Let's sit down and discuss some ideas over coffee. What do you say?<p class=message>Sounds great to me! I'm looking forward to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fc38510d-b16a-4dcf-b33b-fd88425c86c0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
