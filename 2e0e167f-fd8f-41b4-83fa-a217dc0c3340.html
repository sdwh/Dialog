It's always better to have company during lunch.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! So, how was your morning?<p class=message>Busy as usual, but I'm glad it's finally lunchtime.<p class="message sent">Same here. I was craving some Chinese food, so I got some stir-fried noodles.<p class=message>That looks delicious. I decided to go for a salad today.<p class="message sent">A salad? Wow, you're way more health-conscious than I am.<p class=message>Haha, well, I have to watch my figure, you know?<p class="message sent">I hear ya. I should probably start doing that too, especially after last night's pizza binge.<p class=message>It's all about balance, I guess. So, any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm headed to the beach with some friends. Can't wait to soak up some sun.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I'm just planning on catching up on some much-needed sleep.<p class="message sent">Hey, that's important too. You don't want to burn yourself out.<p class=message>Definitely not. So, did you hear about the new company policy on work hours?<p class="message sent">No, what is it?<p class=message>They're extending our work hours by an hour starting next month.<p class="message sent">Are you kidding me? That's insane!<p class=message>I know, right? I don't know how I'm going to manage.<p class="message sent">We'll figure it out, I'm sure. Let's just enjoy our lunch for now.<p class=message>Agreed. Thanks for the company, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A.
