These are some fresh vegetables and fruits I've just harvested from my farm.<p class="message sent">Good morning too! Wow, these all look so fresh and delicious. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Well, our specialty is definitely the heirloom tomatoes. They're juicy and have a unique flavor you won't find in other tomatoes.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'll take a basket of those. How much are they per kilo?<p class=message>They're three euros a kilo today, but if you buy more than five kilos, I can give you a discount.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. I'll definitely take advantage of that. What else do you have?<p class=message>We have some yellow squash, zucchini, onions, and garlic. All of them are freshly picked this morning.<p class="message sent">Perfect! I'll take some onions and garlic. Can we make a deal for the whole lot?<p class=message>Sure, I'll give you a good price for the whole bag. Are you also interested in fruits?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. What do you have?<p class=message>We have some strawberries, raspberries, and some cherries over there. They're all grown organically here in Champagne.<p class="message sent">That's amazing! I'll take a basket of each. What's the total for everything?<p class=message>It'll be 30 euros for all of that. That's including your discount and a little bit of extra for your support.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! I'll definitely come back for more of your fresh produce next week.<p class=message>You're welcome! I'll see you then. Have a great day at the market.<p class="message sent">You too!
