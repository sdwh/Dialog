It seems like the air filter needs to be replaced and the brake pads are worn down.<p class=message>How long do you think it will take to fix?<p class="message sent">Probably a couple of hours, but I'll do my best to get it done as quickly as possible.<p class=message>Great, I have a race tomorrow so I really appreciate your help.<p class="message sent">No worries, I'm always happy to help a fellow racer out.<p class=message>So, how long have you been working as a mechanic?<p class="message sent">It's been about 10 years now. I used to race myself but I found that I enjoyed fixing cars just as much.<p class=message>That's awesome. I've always been fascinated by how cars work but I don't have much knowledge about it myself.<p class="message sent">Well, feel free to ask any questions you might have while I'm working on the car. It's always good to learn more about how your car operates.<p class=message>Thanks, I definitely will. So, have you ever been to any famous racetracks around the world?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been to a few. One of my favorites was the NÃ¼rburgring in Germany. The track is so challenging and it was an amazing experience.<p class=message>That sounds incredible. My dream is to race in Le Mans one day.<p class="message sent">That's a great goal to have. Keep working hard and I'm sure you'll make it happen.<p class=message>Thanks, B. You're always so encouraging.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. I'm happy to support my fellow racers. Okay, the air filter and brake pads are replaced, your car should be good to go now.<p class=message>Wow, that was fast. Thank you so much, B. You're a lifesaver.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. Good luck in your race tomorrow.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0ca8d2cd-9221-497a-9dea-8dabeedd48f3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
