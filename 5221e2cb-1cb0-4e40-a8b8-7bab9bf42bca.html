OWASP Top 10 is a list of the top ten vulnerabilities in web applications.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. How can I learn more about it?<p class=message>Well, there are a lot of resources available online, including tutorials, videos, and documentation.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. But how do I know which resources are the most reliable ones?<p class=message>Good question. One way to ensure reliability is to look for resources from OWASP themselves or from reputable security firms.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tip. What about hands-on experience? Is there a way to practice identifying these vulnerabilities?<p class=message>Absolutely. There are a lot of vulnerable web applications available online specifically for the purpose of practicing identifying these vulnerabilities.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great way to practice. How long do you think it'll take for me to become proficient in identifying these vulnerabilities?<p class=message>Well, that depends on your dedication and how much time you have to devote to it. But generally speaking, a few weeks to a few months should be enough time to become proficient.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll definitely keep that in mind. Thanks for all your help!<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. Just remember to take it one step at a time and don't get overwhelmed. Good luck with your studies!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=521718f7-bd42-4591-860c-d1eec353f75a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
