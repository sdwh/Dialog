Welcome to our store. How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there. I'm a driver passing through this town. I've heard that your store sells some of the best local products. Can you tell me more about them?<p class=message>Of course! We have a wide variety of local specialties, such as seafood, dairy products, and vegetables. Our bestsellers are definitely the fresh crabs and Hokkaido milk.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. I'm a big fan of seafood. Can you recommend any recipes or dishes that I can make with these crabs?<p class=message>Absolutely. Some of our customers love to make crab cakes, crab soup, or simply enjoy them on their own with a side of melted butter.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds amazing. What about your Hokkaido milk? What makes it stand out from regular milk?<p class=message>Hokkaido milk is known for its rich and creamy taste, thanks to the cows that graze on the natural grass and flowers in Hokkaido's countryside. Many people find it much more flavorful than regular milk.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely have to try some then. Do you also have any souvenirs or gifts that I can bring back home for my family and friends?<p class=message>Yes, we have a selection of cute keychains, magnets, and traditional crafts that showcase the beauty of Hokkaido's culture.<p class="message sent">That's perfect. I'll definitely grab some of those as well. Thank you so much for your help!<p class=message>No problem at all. It was a pleasure serving you. Safe travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=93770996-98cd-419f-9324-93ba621424c4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
