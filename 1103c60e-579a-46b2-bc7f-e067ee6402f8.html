May I please see your ticket and bag for a security check?<p class="message sent">Hi, sure! Here's my ticket and my bag.<p class=message>Thank you. Can you please open your bag for me?<p class="message sent">Of course. Here you go.<p class=message>Just a routine check, we're just making sure everything's safe and secure for everyone.<p class="message sent">No problem, safety is important.<p class=message>Absolutely, we want everyone to have a good time without any worries.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. So, have you been working here for long?<p class=message>I've been here for a few years now. It's a cool job, I get to meet lots of interesting people.<p class="message sent">That sounds fun. What's the craziest thing you've seen during a security check?<p class=message>Well, I once caught someone trying to sneak a whole pizza into the venue. I don't think they wanted to share!<p class="message sent">Haha, that's hilarious. But I guess no outside food is allowed, right?<p class=message>Correct, we have plenty of food options inside. And speaking of inside, doors open in just a few minutes!<p class="message sent">Awesome, I can't wait. Thanks for making sure everything's safe and secure.<p class=message>No problem, that's what we're here for. Have a great time! And if you need anything during the concert, just let me know.<p class="message sent">Will do, thanks!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=11025253-99ed-434d-a60b-753725495a2b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
