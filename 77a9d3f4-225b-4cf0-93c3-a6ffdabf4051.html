Heading to Sydney, please.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! You visiting for pleasure or business?<p class=message>Just some much-needed vacation time. I hear Sydney is beautiful this time of year.<p class="message sent">You heard right! It's been a bit chilly lately, but the sights make up for it.<p class=message>Speaking of sights, any recommendations for must-see spots?<p class="message sent">Definitely the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. And if you're up for it, the Coastal Walk is breathtaking.<p class=message>Sounds amazing! How long have you been a taxi driver in Sydney?<p class="message sent">About 10 years now. It's been a wild ride, but I love it.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you have any interesting stories from your time on the job?<p class="message sent">Oh, plenty! I've had famous musicians, politicians, and even a few movie stars in the backseat. But honestly, some of my most memorable rides have been with ordinary folks with extraordinary stories.<p class=message>That's fascinating. I'm sure you've seen all sorts of things in this job.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, every day is an adventure. What about you, what do you do for work?<p class=message>I'm an accountant. Not as exciting as your gig, haha.<p class="message sent">Ah, but everyone needs an accountant! Can't run a business without 'em.<p class=message>Very true. I just need a break from all the numbers and spreadsheets. Ready for some relaxation and fun.<p class="message sent">Well, you picked the right place for it. We'll have you at your hotel in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=77a17975-0a03-41a8-9c3d-b6b99aa861fe.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
