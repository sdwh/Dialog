How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing pretty good. I wanted to check in with you about the source code inspection we did last week.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, what did you find?<p class=message>Well, there were a few areas where we found some vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. Have you had a chance to look over the report?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I went through it earlier today. It looks like we need to make some updates to our input validation, and there are a few areas where we're not properly handling errors.<p class=message>That sounds about right. I was thinking we could schedule some time next week to go over those areas together and work on fixing them.<p class="message sent">That sounds good to me. It'll be nice to have another set of eyes on it.<p class=message>For sure. I'm just glad we caught these things before they became bigger problems.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's always better to be proactive when it comes to security.<p class=message>So true. By the way, did you hear about that new game that came out yesterday?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class=message>It's called "Escape the Office." You have to solve puzzles to get out of your boring office job. It looks pretty fun.<p class="message sent">Ha, that does sound like fun. Count me in!<p class=message>Awesome! We can download it during our lunch break tomorrow.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I can't wait to escape this office for real!<p class=message>Haha, me too. Alright, let's get back to work. Talk to you later, B.<p class="message sent">Later, A. Have a good one!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ae84073f-8bf7-4048-a5e6-8c41ba20701a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
