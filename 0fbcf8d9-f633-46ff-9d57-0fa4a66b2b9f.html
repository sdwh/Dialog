How's the rolling going?<p class="message sent">It's going great, A! I'm loving how this dough feels in my hands.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear! Speaking of dough, have you ever tried making garlic bread?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I have! It's actually one of my favorites to make. Do you have a special recipe?<p class=message>I do actually! I like to mix softened butter with garlic, parsley, and a pinch of salt. Then I spread it onto slices of bread and bake it until golden brown.<p class="message sent">Yum! That sounds amazing. Maybe we can add it to our menu.<p class=message>Definitely! I think it would be a hit. Speaking of menu, what's our biggest seller today?<p class="message sent">It's the croissants! They're flying off the shelves.<p class=message>I'm not surprised! Who can resist the flaky layers and buttery aroma?<p class="message sent">Exactly. And speaking of irresistible, have you tried the chocolate eclairs we made yesterday?<p class=message>Oh my goodness, they were heavenly. I could easily eat a dozen of those.<p class="message sent">Haha, me too! I think we might have to make another batch tomorrow.<p class=message>Agreed. Okay, time to check on the bread in the oven. Can you hand me the oven mitts?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Here you go.<p class=message>Thanks. Wow! This bread is looking amazing. The crust is perfectly crispy.<p class="message sent">That's what I love about baking bread. You never know exactly how it will turn out until it's done.<p class=message>That's so true. But when it turns out well, it's such a satisfying feeling.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Alright, let's get back to work. We have more bread to bake and customers to serve.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0fbbf9d0-3b0b-4a38-995d-d37c8e789b8a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
