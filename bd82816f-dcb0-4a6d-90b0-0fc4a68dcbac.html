I'm happy to assist. The fondue hotpot is one of our best sellers. Can I recommend a side of potatoes or bread to go with it?<p class=message>Yes, please! Let's chat while we wait. Have you tried this dish before?<p class="message sent">Definitely. The local Swiss cheese used in this fondue gives it a unique and delicious taste. It's best paired with a glass of white wine.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. I can't wait to try it. How's the texture of the cheese? Is it thick and creamy?<p class="message sent">The cheese is creamy, and not too thick. You'll enjoy dipping into it!<p class=message>Oh, I see it coming. That looks amazing! The aroma is incredible, too.<p class="message sent">Great to hear that. Make sure to dip it generously into the fondue.<p class=message>(tasting) Mmm... this is amazing! The cheese is so rich and well-balanced.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you're enjoying it. Is there anything in particular that stands out to you?<p class=message>Definitely! The taste of the Gruyere cheese is so unique, and the wine makes it deliciously tangy. I have to give this a 9 out of 10!<p class="message sent">Wow, thank you for that high score! Is there anything you would suggest to make it a perfect 10?<p class=message>Just some light seasoning would do the trick! But it's already great on its own.<p class="message sent">Thank you for your feedback. I'll pass it on to the team. Don't hesitate to come back and try our other dishes!<p class=message>Thanks, I definitely will. It's been a pleasure chatting with you, too!<p class="message sent">You're more than welcome.
