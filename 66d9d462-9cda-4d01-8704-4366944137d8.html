He's really something!<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. He's a great addition to our clinic. I heard he's a bit of a perfectionist though.<p class=message>Isn't that just what we need? You know, attention to detail and all that.<p class="message sent">I agree, but our patients might feel intimidated.<p class=message>Well, that's where we come in. We'll just have to remind them that he's a friendly guy.<p class="message sent">Speaking of friendly, have you seen how he treats his nurse?<p class=message>I haven't noticed. How does he treat her?<p class="message sent">With the utmost respect and kindness. They make a great team.<p class=message>Oh, that's wonderful to hear. A good doctor and nurse relationship is key to patient care.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Speaking of patient care, did you hear about the time he stayed late just to see a patient?<p class=message>No, I haven't. That's really dedicated!<p class="message sent">Yes, and he even called the patient afterward to make sure they were feeling better.<p class=message>Whoa, I'm impressed! I'm so glad we have him here in our clinic.<p class="message sent">Me too! It's always great to work with professionals who truly care about their patients.<p class=message>Definitely. And hey, if we're lucky, maybe he'll surprise us with some snacks or treats!<p class="message sent">Haha, let's hope so! I heard he loves bringing in treats for his team.<p class=message>Yum, I can't wait! This clinic just keeps getting better and better.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=66d3d521-872e-413a-8534-96aaf63b67d0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
