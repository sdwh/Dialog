I heard you wanted some help in learning Git. Is that correct?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. I've heard that it's a really useful tool for software development, but I'm not sure where to start.<p class=message>No problem at all. Let me start by explaining that Git is a version control system that tracks changes in your code over time.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. But how do I get started with Git?<p class=message>The first step is to install Git on your computer. You can usually do this by downloading the Git software package from the official website.<p class="message sent">Ok, got it. What's next?<p class=message>Once you have Git installed, you'll want to create a repository, which is like a folder that contains your code files.<p class="message sent">And then I can start making changes and tracking them?<p class=message>Exactly! Anytime you make changes to your code, you'll want to use Git commands to track and save those changes.<p class="message sent">That definitely sounds like a useful tool to have.<p class=message>It really is! And the best part is that Git is widely used in the software development industry, so you'll be learning a valuable skill that you can apply in your future career.<p class="message sent">That's great to know. Thank you so much for explaining it to me in a TOEIC Gold level.<p class=message>You're very welcome, B. And don't worry if it takes some time to get the hang of it. With practice and persistence, you can become a Git expert in no time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3e4f6b24-17ac-4376-a699-16e49f2f1b7b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
