Are you the server administrator?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. How can I assist you today?<p class=message>I'm the lead auditor for the ISO 27001 certification. I need to perform an audit on your servers. Can we start right away?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's get this show on the road.<p class=message>Great! So, how long have you been working as a server administrator?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's been about five years now. I love it!<p class=message>That's awesome. I heard that you recently upgraded your servers to the latest version. Can you tell me more about that?<p class="message sent">Yes, we did. It was a major upgrade, but it was totally worth it. We're now running on lightning-fast servers with top of the line security measures.<p class=message>That's impressive! Speaking of security, I'm going to need to see your security protocols and policies. Do you have them on hand?<p class="message sent">Of course! Let me just grab those for you.<p class="message sent">Here you go.<p class=message>Thank you. It looks like you've got everything under control.<p class="message sent">We do our best to stay on top of things. You can never be too safe.<p class=message>That's a great attitude to have. So, have you encountered any interesting or unusual server issues lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, we had a strange one a few weeks ago. We got a call from a user who discovered that their files had been replaced with pictures of cats.<p class=message>(laughs) Really? That sounds hilarious!<p class="message sent">It was pretty funny, but we still had to fix it. Turned out to be a malware attack.<p class=message>Ah, yes. Good old malware. Well, thank you for your time today. I'll go through these documents and let you know if we have any further questions.<p class="message sent">Thanks for coming out. It's always good to get some outside perspective.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a5b85de3-e4e0-4c17-9408-5009b9f8c4c7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
