I've been looking forward to this sand volleyball practice all week.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Today we're focusing on serving, so let's warm up with some basic drills.<p class="message sent">Okay, sounds good. I've been working on my top spin serve, do you have any tips on how I can improve it?<p class=message>Of course, one tip is to make sure you hit the ball with the heel of your palm and follow through with your arm.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. I'll try that out. Do you have any tips on footwork?<p class=message>Yes, keep your feet shoulder-width apart and take a small step toward the ball as you hit it. This will give you more power.<p class="message sent">Thanks coach, I'll keep that in mind. Here comes the ball, I'll give it a try.<p class=message>Great job! Your form is looking much better already. Let's keep practicing and see how many serves we can get in a row.<p class="message sent">Yeah, let's do it! This is so much fun.<p class=message>I'm glad you're enjoying it. Remember, sand volleyball is all about having fun and working as a team.<p class="message sent">I definitely agree, this is way more exciting than being in a stuffy gym all day.<p class=message>Exactly! Playing sports outdoors is a fantastic way to stay active and soak up some vitamin D.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Plus, the view of the ocean is pretty amazing.<p class=message>(laughs) It sure is. Alright, let's do a few more drills and then we can play a game.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, coach. Thanks for the great tips and encouragement.<p class=message>Anytime B, keep up the good work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a9e8cf9e-1a8a-444f-9f64-3b903554a59d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
