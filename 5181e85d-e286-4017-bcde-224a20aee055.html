We have a variety of options available depending on your interests and budget. Are you interested in a specific country or region?<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking of doing a tour of Europe, maybe for two or three weeks.<p class=message>Great idea! We have a number of different packages that cover popular cities like Paris, London, Rome, and Berlin. Have you considered visiting any of those?<p class="message sent">Definitely, those are all on my list.<p class=message>Perfect! We also have options for guided tours, group travel, or even customized trips. What would you prefer?<p class="message sent">I think I'd prefer a guided tour with a smaller group of people. That way, I can focus on enjoying the experience without worrying about details like transportation and accommodations.<p class=message>That's a smart choice. We have a few different guided tours that include smaller, intimate groups of travelers. They're led by knowledgeable and experienced guides, so you'll get a lot out of it.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. How about the price? What kind of budget should I expect for a trip like this?<p class=message>We have a few different packages that range in price depending on the itinerary and the level of luxury you're looking for. On average, though, I'd say a two-week guided tour of Europe would start around $2500.<p class="message sent">That's not bad at all. Do you have any current promotions or deals going on?<p class=message>As a matter of fact, we do! If you book a tour before the end of the month, you can get 10% off your package price.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a fantastic deal. I think I'll have to take advantage of that.<p class=message>Excellent! Let me show you some options and we can get you started on the booking process. You're going to have an amazing trip to Europe!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5177b49d-eff9-4373-8bbb-23dc9bc03a0c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
