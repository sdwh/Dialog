How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I have a little problem. I got a speeding ticket last week.<p class=message>Oh no! That's not good. Do you have a history of speeding?<p class="message sent">Not really. I just got caught up in the moment, you know?<p class=message>I understand. The good news is that we can fight this ticket in court. We just need to prove that the speed limit signs were not clearly marked.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good plan. I really don't want this on my record.<p class=message>You're in luck. I just won a similar case last week. Are you sure you weren't in a hurry to get to a donut shop?<p class="message sent">Haha, very funny. Actually, I was heading to a dentist appointment.<p class=message>I see. Well, we'll work on getting this resolved for you. How has your week been otherwise?<p class="message sent">It's been good. I finally finished watching the latest season of my favorite TV show.<p class=message>Which one is that?<p class="message sent">It's a legal drama called "Suits". Have you seen it?<p class=message>Yes, actually. I enjoy it too. Although, I must say, it's probably not the most realistic portrayal of the legal profession.<p class="message sent">Haha, I know. But it's entertaining.<p class=message>Definitely. And speaking of entertainment, have you made any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Not yet, why do you ask?<p class=message>I was just thinking that it's been awhile since we played a round of golf together. How about we hit the course on Saturday morning?<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. Let's do it!<p class=message>Perfect. And don't worry, I promise to let you win this time.<p class="message sent">Haha, we'll see about that. Thanks for your help A, I really appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem, it's what I'm here for. Have a good day B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=94559ac7-c0db-4063-96cf-f8e8023fb0fe.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
