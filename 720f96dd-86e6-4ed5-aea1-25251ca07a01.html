Have you heard that we're transitioning to a new internal web system using Vue.js and ASP.NET MVC 5?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I heard about it. What do you think about the decision to use Vue.js? Do you have any experience with it?<p class=message>Personally, I think it's a great decision. I've worked with Vue.js before and it's such a fun framework to use. It's very intuitive and easy to learn.<p class="message sent">Interesting. I've mostly worked with Angular in the past. How does Vue.js compare to that?<p class=message>I would say Vue.js is more beginner-friendly than Angular. Its syntax is less complicated, and it's easier to understand overall.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. On the backend, we're using ASP.NET MVC 5. Do you have any experience with that?<p class=message>Yes, I've actually worked with ASP.NET MVC 5 quite a bit. It's a solid framework for building web applications, especially for larger projects.<p class="message sent">That's reassuring. I was a little worried about the backend because I haven't worked with ASP.NET MVC 5 before.<p class=message>No worries, I'm happy to help out. Plus, it'll be a good opportunity for you to learn something new.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And with your Vue.js skills, we'll make a great team for this project!<p class=message>I agree! I think this new web system is going to be really impressive once it's completed.<p class="message sent">Me too. And with our combined expertise, we'll be able to make it even better than they imagined.<p class=message>Absolutely. I'm looking forward to working on it together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=720e9a3b-7a58-4b77-8350-5b1388425037.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
