Nice to meet you B, the front-end engineer. Let's start discussing how we can improve the user experience on our website.<p class="message sent">Hello A, I'm glad to be here. I've been looking forward to working with you. What's your initial plan?<p class=message>Well, I've noticed that our website has a lot of text and not enough visual appeal. I was thinking of adding more images and videos to create a more engaging user experience.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. It's essential to make our website visually attractive to keep users hooked. Do you have any specific ideas in mind?<p class=message>Yes, I was thinking of making a mock-up design with a few different options. That way we can see what looks best and what appeals to the target audience.<p class="message sent">Perfect. That's precisely what we need. Do you want me to start coding it after you complete your design?<p class=message>Yes, I think that would be ideal. Also, do you think we should optimize our website for mobile devices as well? Nowadays, many people use their mobile devices to browse the internet.<p class="message sent">Oh, yeah, for sure. It's essential to optimize our website for mobile devices, as most users prefer it nowadays. I'll make sure that the website is responsive and compatible with different screen sizes.<p class=message>Great. What about site speed? Slow site speed can cause users to leave our website. It's critical to ensure that our website loads quickly.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a great point. I'll focus on optimizing the website's code structure and image compression to enhance site speed.<p class=message>Awesome. This is turning out to be a successful brainstorming session. Let's make sure to implement all of these changes to give our users the best experience.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=154d6fad-5832-4b15-bd80-18a416a028d2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
