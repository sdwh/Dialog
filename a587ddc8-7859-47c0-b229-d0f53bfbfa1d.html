I see you're also on the hunt for our missing villagers.<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. It's quite concerning that so many have disappeared without a trace.<p class=message>I know, right? Luckily, I have the skills of a skilled archer and am determined to find them.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. As for me, I am a bit more traditional. I rely on my trusty sword and shield.<p class=message>It's good to have different abilities when it comes to rescuing our dear friends. Do we have any leads so far?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I heard rumors that a group of goblins have been seen in the area.<p class=message>Goblins? Well, I can surely handle them. My arrows always find their targets.<p class="message sent">Don't get too confident. These goblins are notorious for their sneak attacks and can be quite dangerous if not dealt with properly.<p class=message>You're right, my friend. We need to stay alert and work together to find those villagers and bring them back to safety.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And once we rescue them, we'll throw a big celebration in their honor.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We'll have food, music, and drinks. I can't wait to see the smiles on their faces.<p class="message sent">Me too. Let's get going and find those villagers before it's too late.<p class=message>Yes! Let's show those goblins what we're made of!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a57cb0ed-6d22-4f6b-9b80-688fb4b04fef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
