Have you thought about the features we should include?<p class=message>Yes, I was thinking of an easy-to-navigate interface, automatic seat selection, and the ability to choose meals and other amenities.<p class="message sent">Those are all great ideas. Plus, we should also have a section for checking flight statuses and any updates related to delays or cancellations.<p class=message>Definitely, we want to keep our passengers up to date as much as possible. How about using biometrics for check-in and boarding?<p class="message sent">Biometrics are definitely becoming more popular and secure. We could use facial recognition or fingerprint scanning as an option for those who opt-in.<p class=message>That would be a great addition. We should also have an option for passengers to store their payment and personal information for future bookings.<p class="message sent">Safeguarding customer information is a priority, so we'll need to ensure proper encryption and security measures are in place.<p class=message>Absolutely, we don't want to compromise on security. Let's also consider a frequent flyer program and rewards scheme for our loyal customers.<p class="message sent">Good idea, this will encourage customer loyalty and make our airline more attractive to potential flyers. How about integrating the app with our social media channels too?<p class=message>Yes, we can provide real-time updates and promote special deals and discounts through social media.<p class="message sent">This app is going to be a game-changer for our airline. We'll need to work closely with our marketing and IT teams to ensure a smooth launch.<p class=message>Agreed, we'll need to allocate enough resources and test the app thoroughly before launch. But, with both of our expertise, I'm confident we can make it happen.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, let's make our airline the go-to choice for convenient and efficient travel.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6753ab23-386f-4610-9ed1-802fa43599e4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
