I'm excited to learn how to make authentic Spanish chocolate!<p class="message sent">Welcome, A. I'm your guide for the day, B. Are you a chocolate lover?<p class=message>Absolutely! I can't resist a good quality chocolate bar. So, what's on the menu today?<p class="message sent">You'll be learning how to make hot chocolate from scratch, as well as creating your own chocolate truffles. We'll start with the history of chocolate in Spain.<p class=message>Sounds fascinating. Did you know that Spain was one of the first countries to import chocolate from South America?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct. And the process has evolved significantly since then. Now, let's put on our aprons and get started.<p class=message>Wow, there's a lot of equipment here. Where do we begin?<p class="message sent">We'll start by roasting and grinding the cocoa beans to make the chocolate. It's important to get the right texture and balance of flavors.<p class=message>This is hard work! I think I need a chocolate break already.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I understand, but we have to keep going. The reward will be worth it.<p class=message>Alright, let's keep going. This is definitely an art form. I'm starting to get the hang of it.<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed it is. And now it's time to pour our chocolate into molds for the truffles.<p class=message>These look amazing already. I can't wait to taste them!<p class="message sent">Patience is a virtue, A! We have to let them chill for a bit first.<p class=message>(laughs) Fair enough. Hey, did you know that the word "chocolate" actually comes from the Aztec word "xocolatl"?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. And it's fascinating to see how chocolate has traveled the world and become a beloved treat for so many people.<p class=message>Absolutely. And thank you, B, for showing me the ropes. I feel like a true chocolatier now.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. Just remember to save some of those truffles for me!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b1401836-4ae7-47c8-93be-ed152023d6b9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
