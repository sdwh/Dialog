It's one of my favorite Japanese foods!<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've had it a few times. The crispy batter and the juicy seafood or vegetables inside are amazing.<p class=message>I agree! Do you prefer shrimp or vegetables for your tempura?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I love both, but I think I have a slight preference for the shrimp. How about you?<p class=message>I'm definitely team veggie tempura. There's something about the crispy texture and the flavor of sweet potato tempura that I can't resist.<p class="message sent">Sweet potato tempura is delicious, but you're missing out on the shrimp! Just kidding, to each their own.<p class=message>Haha, fair enough. Have you ever tried other types of tempura?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've had squid tempura and it was really good! Have you tried it?<p class=message>Actually, no, but it sounds interesting. I'd love to try it sometime.<p class="message sent">You should! And there's also tempura ice cream if you're feeling adventurous.<p class=message>I've heard of that! It sounds crazy but also yummy.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Tempura is such a versatile dish, you can basically tempura-fry anything and it will taste great.<p class=message>That's so true! I wonder if anyone's tried tempura-frying pizza.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that sounds a bit too wild for me. But who knows, it might just work!<p class=message>Maybe we'll have to try it one day and see for ourselves. Thanks for chatting with me about tempura!<p class="message sent">Of course, always happy to talk about food.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=86d5d6d5-4613-4644-8444-9095159b1c9c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
