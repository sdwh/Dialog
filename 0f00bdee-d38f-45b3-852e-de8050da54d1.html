I prefer rom-coms.<p class="message sent">Rom-coms? Ugh, I can't stand them. I like dramas.<p class=message>Really? I find dramas to be too heavy sometimes.<p class="message sent">That's fair. What about comedies?<p class=message>Oh, I love comedies. They always cheer me up.<p class="message sent">Yeah, comedies are great. Have you seen any good ones recently?<p class=message>I watched this hilarious movie about a group of friends going on a road trip.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good time. I prefer movies with a bit more depth though.<p class=message>I get that. Do you like documentaries?<p class="message sent">Yeah, documentaries are great. I love learning about new things.<p class=message>Same! Have you seen any interesting ones lately?<p class="message sent">I watched one about wildlife conservation efforts in Africa. It was really informative.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds really interesting. I'll have to check it out.<p class="message sent">Definitely do. I think you'll like it. So, what's your least favorite movie genre?<p class=message>Horror movies. I can't handle the suspense and jump scares.<p class="message sent">That's totally understandable. I used to be scared of horror movies too, but I've grown to enjoy them.<p class=message>Really? I don't think I could ever enjoy being scared like that.<p class="message sent">It's not for everyone, that's for sure. But each to their own, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. It's all about personal preference.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0ef70709-b6ac-4411-a284-95c6d144cf19.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
