Your music has a huge following in Japan.<p class=message>That's wonderful to hear. I love coming here to perform. The fans are always so enthusiastic.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And we've been getting some good press coverage too. The local media seems to be interested in your new album.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. I think it's some of my best work yet. I put a lot of heart into those songs.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We should make sure to promote it heavily during tonight's concert. Maybe mention it a few times between songs.<p class=message>Good idea. I always like to give the fans a taste of what's coming up next.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, have you decided on tonight's setlist?<p class=message>Yes, I think so. I'll start with some of my more upbeat numbers to get the crowd going, then slow it down a bit in the middle, and finish with a bang for the encore.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. And don't forget to give a shout-out to the local fans. They always appreciate that.<p class=message>Absolutely. I love the energy here in Osaka. It's always a great crowd.<p class="message sent">And don't forget about the merch table. Your fans love to buy souvenirs and memorabilia.<p class=message>Of course. We've got plenty of t-shirts and posters for sale. And I'll make sure to sign some autographs too.<p class="message sent">Great. You're a true professional.
