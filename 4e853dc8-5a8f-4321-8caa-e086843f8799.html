But why do some people not get sick even when the weather changes?<p class="message sent">It's because everyone's immune system is different. Some people's immune systems are stronger than others, making them more resistant to catching a cold.<p class=message>What about fever? Is that also related to weather changes?<p class="message sent">Fever is usually caused by an infection in your body, so it's not directly related to weather changes. However, changes in temperature can make you more uncomfortable when you have a fever.<p class=message>That makes sense. So how can I prevent getting sick when the weather changes?<p class="message sent">One way is to make sure you're dressed appropriately for the weather, and also to keep your hands clean by washing them frequently. And of course, getting enough sleep and eating healthy can strengthen your immune system too.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice, daddy! I'll make sure to take good care of myself.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, kiddo! And remember, if you do happen to catch a cold, plenty of rest and fluids can help you feel better faster.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e8516f4-d4d6-4970-aef6-a09fcb96b964.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
