How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I work for a car rental company and we are looking to start providing rental services here at the airport parking lot. Can you tell me about the process for that?<p class=message>Sure thing! We have designated spots for rental cars in the lot. You'll need to reserve a parking spot ahead of time and provide us with your company's logo for identification purposes.<p class="message sent">That sounds easy enough. Do you require any specific documentation from us?<p class=message>Yes, we require proper insurance coverage for each rental car, as well as registration and inspection documents. Your customers will also need to provide a valid driver's license.<p class="message sent">Understood. Is there a maximum rental period or any limitations on where the cars can go?<p class=message>The maximum rental period is 30 days. As for limitations, we require that rental cars stay within a 30-mile radius of the airport. Any further, and additional fees will be required.<p class="message sent">Okay, that's good to know. Are there any shuttle services to the terminals or do customers need to walk to the gate?<p class=message>We have a complimentary shuttle service that runs every 10 minutes, so your customers can easily get to and from the airport terminals.<p class="message sent">Wonderful. Thank you so much for your help! This information will be very helpful for our rental service launch.<p class=message>My pleasure! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a3d74983-7ec9-44ca-94e9-ccbc6d6b07db.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
