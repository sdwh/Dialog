What did you think about it, B?<p class="message sent">I agree, A! My heart was pounding so fast, but it was so worth it. Did you have a favorite part?<p class=message>Definitely the part where we dropped downwards at such a steep angle. I felt like my stomach was left behind!<p class="message sent">Haha, me too! But I also enjoyed the loop-de-loop, it was so thrilling.<p class=message>I know right?! I couldn't stop screaming. Did you close your eyes at any point during the ride?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, during the corkscrew twist. I thought I was going to lose my phone, it was slipping out of my pocket.<p class=message>That's hilarious! I made sure I held on tight to my sunglasses too. Have you been on any other roller coasters before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but this one was my favorite so far. How about you?<p class=message>Same here, I just can't get enough of the adrenaline rush. Oh and check out the photo they took of us! We look so scared!<p class="message sent">Haha, I know right? We should totally get those as souvenirs. Would you be up for going on another ride?<p class=message>Definitely! Let's go get in line for the giant drop. I heard it's even more intense than this one.<p class="message sent">Oh boy, that sounds thrilling! Let's do it. Thanks for the recommendation, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1cd8804c-b691-4a3e-8118-c15ef02a16e2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
