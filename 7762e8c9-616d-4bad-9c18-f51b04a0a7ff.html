Thanks for asking. We've had quite a few patrons here tonight.<p class=message>I noticed! You're a popular guy behind the bar. What's been the most popular cocktail of the night?<p class="message sent">Surprisingly, it's been the classic Old Fashioned. Seems people are into the more traditional drinks these days.<p class=message>Interesting. What's your personal favorite cocktail to make?<p class="message sent">I love making anything with fresh fruit. My current favorite is a mango and chili margarita.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! Maybe you can make one for me after your shift ends?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A. I'd love to. Have you had a chance to step out onto our balcony and take in the view tonight?<p class=message>Not yet, but I heard it's breathtaking.<p class="message sent">It really is. You should go out there and take a look before the night is over. It's one of the best spots in the entire city.<p class=message>I definitely will. Hey, have you heard about the new upscale French restaurant that's opening up down the street?<p class="message sent">I have. I'm excited to try it out myself. You thinking about taking a trip there soon?<p class=message>Absolutely. I heard the chef is highly regarded and the menu looks amazing. Maybe we can organize a staff outing.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! We can make it a team event.<p class=message>Definitely. Hey, I wanted to thank you again for helping us create such a unique and memorable cocktail menu for our bar here at Marina Bay Sands.<p class="message sent">Of course, A. It was my pleasure. I'm always happy to collaborate and create something special for our guests.<p class=message>Well, our guests certainly love it. You're a talented mixologist, B.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I appreciate it. Cheers to another successful night at the bar!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=775ce3f8-811d-4405-8d11-ba68375804bc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
