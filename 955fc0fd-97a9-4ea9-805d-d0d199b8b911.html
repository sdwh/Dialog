Welcome to our travel agency. How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm interested in visiting San Francisco. Can you suggest a tour package for me?<p class=message>Sure! We have a few options. Our most popular one is the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz tour. It's a two-day trip that includes a ferry ride to the infamous island prison.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. What else is included?<p class=message>You'll also get a guided tour of the bridge and a visit to Fisherman's Wharf. Plus, we'll give you a pass for the cable car so you can explore the city on your own.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. How much does it cost?<p class=message>It's $250 per person. But if you book with a friend, we can offer you a discount.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll definitely consider that. Do you have any other tours?<p class=message>Yes, we also have a Wine Country Tour where you can visit some of the best wineries in the area.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love wine. Can you tell me more about that tour?<p class=message>Of course. It's a full-day tour and includes transportation to Sonoma or Napa Valley, depending on your preference. You'll get to try different wines and enjoy the beautiful scenery.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. How much is it?<p class=message>It's $300 per person. But again, if you book with a friend, we can offer you a discount.<p class="message sent">I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for your help!<p class=message>You're welcome. Let me know if you have any other questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=955a9b57-e1c3-4514-a075-8571a0a09976.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
