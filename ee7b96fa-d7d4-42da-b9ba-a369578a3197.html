Can I get you anything to drink?<p class="message sent">Hi, thanks for having me. A coffee would be great, thank you.<p class=message>So, tell me a little bit about yourself. What do you do for a living?<p class="message sent">Well, I work as an interior designer. I love creating beautiful and functional spaces for people to enjoy.<p class=message>That sounds fascinating. How did you get into that line of work?<p class="message sent">As a child, I was always rearranging my room and making it look stylish. I eventually decided to pursue it as a career and got a degree in interior design.<p class=message>Wow, it seems like you really followed your passion. Do you have any favourite design styles or eras?<p class="message sent">Definitely, I absolutely adore mid-century modern design. I think it's timeless and has a unique charm to it.<p class=message>That's really interesting. What's the most challenging project you've ever worked on?<p class="message sent">There was one project where the client had a very specific vision, but the space was quite small. It was challenging to meet all their requests while still making the space look stylish and functional.<p class=message>I can imagine that must have been tough. What do you do for fun outside of work?<p class="message sent">I love to travel and explore new places. I find inspiration for my designs everywhere I go.<p class=message>That's great. Any upcoming trips planned?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. I'm heading to Japan next month. I'm excited to experience the culture and see all the beautiful design that comes out of there.<p class=message>Sounds amazing. Well, it was great getting to know you better. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, it was a pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ee78a0ff-38b0-4685-b388-8bfc4cc6a073.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
