Could you help me out?<p class="message sent">Of course! What's the occasion you need the suit for?<p class=message>It's for a wedding.<p class="message sent">Well, in that case, you might want to go for a classic style, like a navy blue or grey suit with a matching tie. It's timeless and always looks good.<p class=message>Sounds good to me, but I also want something a bit different to stand out.<p class="message sent">How about trying a slim-fit suit in a bold color, like red or green? You'll definitely make a statement.<p class=message>Hmm, I don't know if I'm brave enough for that.<p class="message sent">No problem, we have plenty of options in between classic and bold. Maybe a patterned suit or one with a textured fabric would be interesting but not too daring.<p class=message>That could work. Do you have any suggestions for what type of shirt and shoes to pair with it?<p class="message sent">A white or light blue shirt is always a safe choice, and you can't go wrong with black dress shoes. But if you really want to switch it up, you could try a patterned shirt or brown shoes for a bit of personality.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. I'm excited to try on some options now.<p class="message sent">Great! Let me know if you need any help picking out sizes or getting alterations. We'll make sure you look sharp for the wedding.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=be95d823-c6ab-4cd2-b2d1-d5c80e00ecbc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
