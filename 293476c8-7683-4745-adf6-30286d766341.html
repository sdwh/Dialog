Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I'm thinking of getting into it myself, but I don't really know where to start.<p class="message sent">Ah, gotcha. Well, I recommend starting with the basics, like HTML and CSS.<p class=message>Those are the building blocks of web design, right?<p class="message sent">Exactly. Once you have a decent grasp of those, you can move on to more advanced topics like JavaScript and jQuery.<p class=message>I've heard of those, but I'm not really familiar with what they do.<p class="message sent">JavaScript is used for creating dynamic effects on a webpage, while jQuery is a library that simplifies JavaScript code.<p class=message>That sounds pretty useful.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And if you really want to take your front-end skills to another level, you can also learn about responsive design and user experience.<p class=message>Wow, there's so much to learn!<p class="message sent">Yeah, but the great thing is that there are tons of resources out there, like online courses and forums, to help you along the way.<p class=message>That's good to know. I don't want to end up feeling overwhelmed.<p class="message sent">It can definitely be a lot to take in, but just take it one step at a time and you'll get there.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. I'm excited to get started now.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. And who knows, maybe one day we'll even be working as front-end devs at the same company!<p class=message>That would be awesome! We'll have to promise not to compete too much though.<p class="message sent">Haha, deal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=292be709-20b6-44d6-8a77-ac245aebf98c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
