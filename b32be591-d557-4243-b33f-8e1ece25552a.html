Just busy with the ISO 27001 audit.<p class=message>Yeah, I hear you. It's a lot of work, but it's good to ensure compliance.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm just glad there's no looming deadline for this one.<p class=message>I hear you. It's always nice to be able to take the time to do things right.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, have you found any interesting findings so far during the audit?<p class=message>Actually, I found a coffee mug on one of the desks that's been there for a while. Maybe we need to implement a cleaning policy?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Good catch! Maybe we need to add that to our security policy.<p class=message>Speaking of policies, have you had any luck with getting everyone to read and understand them?<p class="message sent">It's a work in progress. Some people are definitely more receptive than others.<p class=message>Yeah, it can be tough to get everyone on board. But it's important to keep trying.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Hey, have you seen that new IT security training video yet?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's actually pretty funny. They use humor to get the message across, and it seems to be working.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Humor always helps with learning and retention.<p class="message sent">Definitely. So, anything else interesting you've found during the audit?<p class=message>Well, I did notice that someone is still using the password "123456". Maybe we need to implement stronger password policies?<p class="message sent">(sighs) Yeah, that's always a tough one. But it definitely needs to be addressed.<p class=message>Agreed. It's the little things that can make a big difference in security.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Well, let's get back to it. The audit won't complete itself.<p class=message>(laughs) True that. Let's show ISO 27001 who's boss!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b32b4f2c-d49d-4890-b5d9-8c015710391a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
