How many people in your party?<p class="message sent">Hi, there are four of us. Is it busy tonight?<p class=message>It's a little busy, but we have some tables available. Do you have a preference?<p class="message sent">Actually, we were hoping for a table near the windows if possible.<p class=message>Of course, let me see what I can do. Here we go, this table works. Is this okay with you?<p class="message sent">Perfect, thank you so much! What do you recommend on the menu?<p class=message>The beef tenderloin is very popular, and our seafood pasta is always a hit.<p class="message sent">Hmm, those both sound great. I think I'll go with the beef tenderloin.<p class=message>Excellent choice. And for drinks, would you like to start with any cocktails or wine?<p class="message sent">Can you recommend a good red wine to pair with the beef?<p class=message>Absolutely. We have a lovely cabernet sauvignon that would be perfect.<p class="message sent">Sounds great, I'll have a glass of that please.<p class=message>Great, enjoy your meal! And let me know if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Thank you, we will!<p class=message>How is everything so far?<p class="message sent">Amazing! The beef is so tender and flavorful. And the wine is a perfect match.<p class=message>I'm so glad to hear that! Is there anything else I can get for you at the moment?<p class="message sent">Actually, we haven't decided on dessert yet. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Our tiramisu is to die for, and the chocolate lava cake is always a crowd favorite as well.<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough decision. Can we get one of each to share for the table?<p class=message>Absolutely! I'll place that order right away. Can I also get you some coffee or tea with your dessert?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. And could we get the bill when you have a moment?<p class=message>Of course, I'll be right back with that. Enjoy your desserts!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4500f2a8-9919-4f72-b645-61e693268467.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
