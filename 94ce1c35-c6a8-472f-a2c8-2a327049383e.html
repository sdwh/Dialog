How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I have a few legal questions regarding a recent business deal.<p class=message>Of course, I'm here to help. What's the situation?<p class="message sent">Well, I recently sold my company and I want to know if there are any legal issues that may arise in the future.<p class=message>That's a great question. Did you have a lawyer when you negotiated the sale?<p class="message sent">I did, but I just want to be sure that everything is in order.<p class=message>Absolutely. It never hurts to double-check. Did you have any specific concerns?<p class="message sent">Not really, just making sure everything is legally binding and there won't be any surprises.<p class=message>Good thinking. We can review the documents together and I'll answer any questions you may have.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help.<p class=message>No problem at all. You're in good hands. Now, let's dive into these papers!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a party to me! Thank you again, I appreciate it.<p class=message>Anytime. And don't worry, we'll make this as fun as talking about legal matters can be!<p class="message sent">Haha, I'm looking forward to it. Maybe I'll even bring some snacks.<p class=message>Perfect! I'll bring the legal jargon, and you bring the snacks. We've got this!<p class="message sent">Deal! Sorry to be a bit of a worrywart, but I just want to be sure everything is in order.<p class=message>Hey, that's what I'm here for. Don't apologize! We'll go through everything thoroughly and make sure everything is good to go.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I feel much better now.<p class=message>My pleasure.
