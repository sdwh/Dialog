I can't believe how old it is.<p class="message sent">Yes, Clearwater Temple has been around for over 1,200 years! It's amazing to witness such ancient architectural beauty.<p class=message>I completely agree. I'm definitely going to include that in my article. Speaking of which, do you have any interesting historical tidbits to share?<p class="message sent">Well, did you know that legendary Japanese monk and philosopher, Eisai, introduced Zen Buddhism to Kyoto at this very temple?<p class=message>No way! That's definitely something to include. What else do you recommend I mention?<p class="message sent">The famous taho-to pagoda, or the "Tower of Many Treasures," is one of the most recognizable symbols of Clearwater Temple. Also, the temple offers an incredible view of Kyoto from the main stage.<p class=message>Perfect. I'm definitely including those details. Hey, how about we try some of the local snacks after we finish exploring?<p class="message sent">Great idea! I highly recommend trying the yatsuhashi, a traditional Japanese sweet made from glutinous rice flour and cinnamon.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. And what about drinks?<p class="message sent">Well, if you're feeling adventurous, you could try sake, a traditional Japanese rice wine.<p class=message>I'm definitely feeling adventurous. Let's do it. Thank you so much for showing me around, B.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, A. I'm glad I could help you with your article. When will it be published?<p class=message>It should be published in a couple of months. I'll make sure to send you a copy.<p class="message sent">That would be wonderful. Thank you, A. Enjoy the rest of your stay in Kyoto.<p class=message>Thank you, B.
