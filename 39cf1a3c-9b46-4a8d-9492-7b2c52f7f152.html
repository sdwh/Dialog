What are you looking for?"<p class=message>"I'm in the market for a new pair of shoes. What about you?"<p class="message sent">"Actually, I need some new dress shirts for work."<p class=message>"Nice, where do you usually go to shop for those?"<p class="message sent">"I usually go to department stores, but I've also had some luck online."<p class=message>"I'm not a big online shopper, but maybe I should give it a try. Any recommendations?"<p class="message sent">"There are so many options! I like to browse on Amazon or Nordstrom online."<p class=message>"Thanks for the tips! But do you ever have trouble finding the right size?"<p class="message sent">"Definitely, but I always check the size guide and read reviews from other customers."<p class=message>"Ah, good idea. Have you ever ordered something and it ended up not fitting?"<p class="message sent">"Oh yeah, that's happened to me before. But that's the risk of online shopping, right? Have you ever ordered something and it looked completely different in person?"<p class=message>"Absolutely! I once ordered a dress that looked red online, but it ended up being more of a pink color."<p class="message sent">"Ha, that's the worst! How did you handle it?"<p class=message>"I just returned it and got my money back. Have you ever returned something online?"<p class="message sent">"Yeah, but it's such a hassle. I try to avoid it if I can."<p class=message>"I know what you mean, but sometimes it's worth it to get what you really want. Do you have any other shopping tips?"<p class="message sent">"Always set a budget before you start shopping, and stick to it! And don't be afraid to ask for help from store associates if you need it."<p class=message>"Those are great tips, thanks for sharing! Maybe we should go shopping together sometime."<p class="message sent">"Yes! I would love that. Let's plan a shopping day soon."</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=39cb2510-6b12-4648-948c-01d29a274943.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
