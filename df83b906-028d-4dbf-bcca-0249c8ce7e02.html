Thanks for meeting me here today. I wanted to talk to you about my latest manuscript.<p class="message sent">Of course, happy to help! What's it about?<p class=message>It's a romantic comedy set in a small town. I think it has a lot of potential, but I'm struggling with the pacing.<p class="message sent">Well, let's take a look. Can you pass me a copy?<p class=message>Sure, here you go. What do you think so far?<p class="message sent">Hmm, it's definitely cute, but I think you might benefit from adding a bit more conflict. Maybe throw in a rival love interest?<p class=message>Oh, that's a good idea. I was a little worried it was too formulaic.<p class="message sent">No worries, there's nothing wrong with following a formula as long as you put your own spin on it. How about tightening up some of the dialogue, too?<p class=message>Absolutely. I always struggle with writing believable conversations.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it can be tough. I think it would help to read some examples of romantic comedies with snappy dialogue so you can get a feel for it.<p class=message>That's a good suggestion. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Actually, I just read 'The Hating Game' by Sally Thorne and I think it might be up your alley.<p class=message>Thanks, I'll definitely check it out. Anything else you noticed that needs work?<p class="message sent">Maybe just some minor grammar stuff, but overall it's coming along nicely. Don't be too hard on yourself!<p class=message>I appreciate that. Thanks so much for your help, I feel a lot better about this project now.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. Keep me updated on your progress!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=df7dad63-f2f3-4b9b-abd4-5bca9037412a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
