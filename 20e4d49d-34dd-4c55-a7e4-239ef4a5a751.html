I spent some time on it over the weekend and I have a few comments.<p class=message>Sure, what do you think we should change?<p class="message sent">Well, to be honest, I think we need a bit more time for testing. It's always better to take our time and make sure everything works properly.<p class=message>I see your point. How much more time do you think we need?<p class="message sent">Two weeks should be enough. But then we'll have to adjust the rest of the schedule accordingly.<p class=message>That's a good point. But you know what they say, better late than never!<p class="message sent">I agree! Speaking of that, have you ever been late to an important meeting?<p class=message>Oh boy, have I! One time I was running so late that I put my shirt on inside out without realizing it!<p class="message sent">Haha, that's hilarious! Were you able to fix it before the meeting?<p class=message>Yes, thankfully I realized it just in time. But I was so embarrassed I almost wished I hadn't!<p class="message sent">I know the feeling. Once I showed up to a meeting with two different shoes on!<p class=message>No way! That's even worse than an inside-out shirt!<p class="message sent">Yeah, it was pretty embarrassing. But we still managed to get the job done. Just like we will with this project!<p class=message>Exactly! I'm glad we can laugh about our mistakes, and that we work well together to overcome any challenges.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. Now let's get back to those schedule adjustments!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=20e38449-a58a-4954-9d79-584ce3bad236.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
