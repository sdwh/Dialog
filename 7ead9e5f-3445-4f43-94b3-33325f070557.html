How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there. The room I stayed in last night needs some cleaning.<p class=message>Absolutely! We can arrange housekeeping to come by at a time that’s convenient for you. What works for you?<p class="message sent">I have a meeting at 10 am, so sometime before then would be great.<p class=message>No problem. I’ll put in the request and they will be there within the hour.<p class="message sent">Thanks a lot. By the way, I really enjoyed the breakfast this morning. What’s in the omelette?<p class=message>Oh, I’m glad to hear that! We use fresh spinach, tomatoes, onions, and cheddar cheese.<p class="message sent">Yum. I might have to get that again tomorrow. So, how long have you been working here?<p class=message>I’ve been here for about a year now. It’s a great place to work and the guests are always interesting.<p class="message sent">That’s awesome to hear. Do you have any recommendations for things to do around here?<p class=message>There’s a great park about five minutes away that has some beautiful trails for hiking or jogging. And if you’re interested in shopping, there are some great boutiques and independent shops in the downtown area.<p class="message sent">Sounds like there’s plenty to explore. Thanks for the tips.<p class=message>No problem, always happy to help. Did you need anything else taken care of during your stay?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I accidentally left my toothbrush at home. Do you have any extra ones available?<p class=message>Of course we do! We have some complimentary dental kits available for guests at the front desk. I’ll grab one for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much. You’ve been really helpful.<p class=message>It’s my pleasure. Let me know if there’s anything else I can do for you. Enjoy your day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7e96ae6c-d77a-48d7-9774-22fbb51220e3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
