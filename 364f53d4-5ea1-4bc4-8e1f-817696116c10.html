I have so much going on in my life right now.<p class=message>That's understandable. Would you like to talk about what's been causing your stress?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have a lot going on with school and extracurricular activities, plus some personal issues too.<p class=message>It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. Have you tried any stress-management techniques?<p class="message sent">I've tried meditating and exercise, but it doesn't seem to help much.<p class=message>That's okay, stress-management techniques aren't one-size-fits-all. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor?<p class="message sent">I haven't, but I think it could be helpful.<p class=message>Definitely. It's always good to have someone to talk to and help you work through your stressors. Would you like a referral for a therapist?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. Thank you for your help.<p class=message>You're welcome.
