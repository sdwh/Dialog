Welcome back to class. How was your weekend, B?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. I had a great weekend, thanks for asking. I went to the beach with my family.<p class=message>That sounds like fun. Did you swim in the ocean?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. The water was cold, but it was worth it.<p class=message>Speaking of cold, I hope you all brought warm jackets today. It's freezing outside.<p class="message sent">Actually, I forgot my jacket. Do you have an extra one I can borrow?<p class=message>Sure, no problem. Speaking of forgetting things, did you guys hear about the student who forgot a pen on exam day and had to write with a lipstick?<p class="message sent">That's hilarious! I'll make sure to double check my exam day supplies from now on.<p class=message>It's always a good idea to be prepared. Now, let's get started with today's lesson. We'll be learning about idiomatic expressions.<p class="message sent">Oh, fun! Can you give us an example?<p class=message>Sure. "Bite the bullet" is an expression that means to endure something difficult or unpleasant.<p class="message sent">Oh, I think I've heard that one before. I'll make sure to use it in conversation soon.<p class=message>Great! Practice makes perfect. Speaking of practice, let's do a speaking activity to practice using these expressions.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I'm ready to impress my friends with my new vocabulary.<p class=message>That's the spirit! Let's get started.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5567be27-ae60-4af2-9c75-727b96b8e0c5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
