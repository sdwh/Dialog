How long will it take us to get to Madrid?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Well, it depends on the traffic, but usually it takes about two and a half hours.<p class=message>Oh, that's not too bad. I'm excited to visit Madrid for the first time.<p class="message sent">It's a beautiful city! Is there anything specific you're looking forward to seeing?<p class=message>Definitely the museums and the Castle of Madrid. What about you? Do you have a favorite spot in the city?<p class="message sent">I love Retiro Park. It's a perfect place to relax and escape the city buzz for a while.<p class=message>Sounds great! I'm also looking forward to trying some traditional Spanish food. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely try the tapas. They're small dishes that you can share with friends and sample different flavors. And don't forget to try churros with hot chocolate for breakfast!<p class=message>Yum, that sounds delicious. I'll definitely try those. Have you ever been to any festivals in Madrid?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. The most famous one is San Fermin, but my favorite is La Tomatina in Valencia. It's basically a giant tomato fight!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. I might have to add that to my bucket list. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! It's always great to share travel tips and experiences. Speaking of, have you been to any other cities in Spain?<p class=message>No, this is my first time in Spain. But hopefully not the last! I'd love to explore more of the country.<p class="message sent">There are so many beautiful places to visit. I recommend Barcelona for its unique architecture and Seville for its flamenco dancing.<p class=message>That's great to know. I'll keep those in mind for my next trip. Thanks for the suggestions, driver!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Happy travels and enjoy your stay in Madrid!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ef2578e4-7888-4ffc-a73f-d38e193dc074.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
