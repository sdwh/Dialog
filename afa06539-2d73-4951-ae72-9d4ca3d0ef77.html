I've been experiencing a dry mouth and drowsiness.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Those are common side effects of antihistamines. Have you tried drinking more water or using sugar-free gum or candies to alleviate the dry mouth?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Thank you for the suggestion.<p class=message>As for the drowsiness, it usually goes away after a few days of taking the medication. But if it persists, you should talk to your doctor to see if there is an alternative medication that has fewer side effects.<p class="message sent">Alright, I will keep that in mind. Thank you for your help.<p class=message>Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class="message sent">Actually, do you have any recommendations for a good sunscreen that won't irritate my skin?<p class=message>Absolutely. I would recommend a mineral-based sunscreen that contains zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. They are less likely to cause irritation and are also safe for sensitive skin.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much. You've been really helpful.<p class=message>Anytime. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=af9e366d-7e56-49dd-853d-dc30996fb5a2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
