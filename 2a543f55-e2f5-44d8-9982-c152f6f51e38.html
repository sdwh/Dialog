How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks. So, what's on the menu tonight?<p class="message sent">We've got some delicious options tonight. We have grilled salmon with roasted vegetables, chicken piccata with garlic mashed potatoes, and a vegetarian pasta dish with pesto sauce.<p class=message>Wow, that all sounds delicious. I'm sure our customers will be pleased.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Speaking of customers, did you hear about the customer who ordered a pizza with extra cheese and then complained that it was too greasy?<p class=message>(laughs) No way! That's just crazy.<p class="message sent">Yeah, some people just can't be satisfied no matter what we do.<p class=message>That's true. But it's always rewarding to see a happy customer enjoying their meal.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of happy customers, I had a couple last night who were celebrating their anniversary and they loved everything about their meal.<p class=message>That's great to hear! It's always nice to be a part of special occasions like that.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Well, I better go check on another table. Have a good service tonight, A!<p class=message>Thanks, B! You too. And don't forget to save some food for me to try later.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Will do, Chef!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a539009-1b6d-4d21-b4ef-1ae6ddd34310.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
