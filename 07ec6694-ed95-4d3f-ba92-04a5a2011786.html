Can I see your license and registration, please?<p class="message sent">Good morning, officer. Sure thing. (hands over documents)<p class=message>Thank you. Do you know why I pulled you over today?<p class="message sent">I'm not sure, to be honest.<p class=message>You were going 10 kilometers over the speed limit. Is there a reason for that?<p class="message sent">Sorry about that, officer. I was running late for an appointment.<p class=message>No problem, but we can't have drivers exceeding the speed limit. It's for everyone's safety.<p class="message sent">Understood. I'll be more careful in the future.<p class=message>I appreciate that. So, where are you headed today?<p class="message sent">I'm just heading to work. How about you, officer?<p class=message>I'm patrolling the highway today, making sure everyone is driving safely. It can be a pretty boring job, but I enjoy the opportunity to help keep people safe.<p class="message sent">It's great to have officers like you out here making a difference. Thank you for what you do.<p class=message>Thank you, sir. That means a lot. Before you head off, I just need to give you a warning about your speed today. Drive safe and have a good day.<p class="message sent">Thank you, officer. You too. (starts car and drives away)<p class=message>(to himself) Another satisfied driver.
