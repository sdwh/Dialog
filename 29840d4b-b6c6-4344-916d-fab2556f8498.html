Have you heard about ISO 27001 Threat Assessment?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. Why do you ask?<p class=message>I was just wondering if you found it as mind-boggling as I did.<p class="message sent">Well, at first it seemed daunting, but once I got into it, I found it quite interesting.<p class=message>Interesting? Really?<p class="message sent">Yeah! It's like playing detective and trying to anticipate any possible security risks.<p class=message>I never thought of it that way. I just assumed it was all about ticking boxes.<p class="message sent">No way! It's more like a puzzle, trying to piece together all the potential threats and vulnerabilities.<p class=message>Hmm, okay, I can see the appeal now. But how do you stay focused during the assessment?<p class="message sent">Good question. I make it a game - I see how quickly I can identify each threat and then prioritize them.<p class=message>That's actually a smart approach. It adds some fun to something that could be tedious.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Plus, it's pretty satisfying when you can identify a potential threat that others might have missed.<p class=message>I can see why you find it interesting now. I might have to change my opinion about threat assessments!<p class="message sent">Hey, if you're up for a challenge, you should give it a go. Who knows, you might surprise yourself.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=29832f92-f208-4304-a7f1-7009eed388e7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
