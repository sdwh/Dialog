I heard you're working on a new sci-fi game. Can you give me some details?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Yeah, we're designing a game set in a post-apocalyptic world where robots have taken over.<p class=message>That sounds intense. What kind of characters will we get to play as?<p class="message sent">We have a few different characters players can choose from. One is a tech-savvy hacker, another is a tough survivalist, and there's even a robotic character.<p class=message>Nice! I always like having different options to choose from. What kind of weapons and equipment will we have access to?<p class="message sent">We're still working on the specifics, but players will definitely have access to high-tech gadgets and weapons. Think laser guns and robot pets.<p class=message>Awesome! How about the storyline? What can we expect?<p class="message sent">The storyline is all about the humans trying to take back control from the robots. It'll be a mix of action and strategy.<p class=message>Sounds like an exciting game. When can we expect it to be released?<p class="message sent">We're hoping to release it in about 6 months. It's a big project, so we want to make sure it's perfect.<p class=message>I can't wait to play it! Do you have any early access versions I can try out?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, we're not quite there yet. But stay tuned for updates and sneak peeks!<p class=message>Will do! Thanks for sharing about the game, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Looking forward to seeing you in the game!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2d296da9-538e-401c-a760-b1f96cf5d23f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
