I'm a bit overwhelmed trying to figure out how to fix them.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Have you tried prioritizing the vulnerabilities based on their severity and how easily they can be exploited?<p class="message sent">Yes, but it's challenging to know which ones to focus on first. They all seem equally critical to me.<p class=message>Hmm, what about collaborating with other developers on the team to fix them together?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I'll set up a meeting later this week to discuss it with the team.<p class=message>Awesome! You could also consider reaching out to the developers who wrote the affected code to get their input.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's always helpful to get different perspectives. Thanks for your advice, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. Just remember to take it one step at a time. You'll get it sorted out. Is there anything else you want to talk about?<p class="message sent">Actually, now that you mention it, have you seen that new Netflix show everyone's been talking about?<p class=message>Which one?<p class="message sent">You know, the one about the woman who can talk to animals.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard of that but haven't watched it yet. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">It's hilarious! You should definitely check it out.<p class=message>I'll add it to my watchlist. Thanks for the recommendation, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e0aa4809-71f9-4754-879b-fffebca68781.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
