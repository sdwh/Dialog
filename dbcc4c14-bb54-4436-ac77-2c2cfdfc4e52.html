Welcome to our little farm. Are you here for some fruit picking?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, I am. I've always wanted to try it, and I heard this is the perfect place for it.<p class=message>Oh, that’s great. You came at a great time. Our peaches and apples are in season.<p class="message sent">That sounds lovely. Which one would you recommend for a first-timer like me?<p class=message>I'd recommend the peaches. They're easy to pick and super juicy.<p class="message sent">Yum! Count me in. So, how does this work exactly?<p class=message>It's pretty straightforward. We give you a basket, show you the right way to pick them, and you do the rest.<p class="message sent">Got it. Are there any tips you can give me?<p class=message>Definitely. Make sure you grab them gently to avoid bruising, and try to avoid picking unripe ones.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the heads up. So, how long have you been working here on this farm?<p class=message>Well, my family has been running this place for generations, so I grew up here.<p class="message sent">That's amazing! It must be so nice to live in such a beautiful place.<p class=message>Yes, it is. We have a beautiful countryside here in South Australia. I feel lucky to call this place my home.<p class="message sent">I can definitely see why. It's so peaceful out here.<p class=message>Yeah, we love it. It's a bit of a change from the city life, but it's peaceful and rewarding work.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. I think I'm ready to start picking. Thanks for your help and for sharing a bit of your story with me.<p class=message>No worries at all, mate. Enjoy your picking and make sure to try some of the fruit before you leave.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dbcb0044-1d7c-4692-a8ba-751e1e7ad243.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
