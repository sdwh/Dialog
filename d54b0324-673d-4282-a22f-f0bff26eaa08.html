You and mommy always make the decisions.<p class=message>How about some grilled fish and Caesar salad?<p class="message sent">Yay, that sounds great! Can we have some French fries too, please?<p class=message>Of course, we can share a plate. So, B, tell us about your day at school.<p class="message sent">It was fun, we did some painting and played games. Oh, and we learned about the planets in our solar system.<p class=message>That's amazing, did you learn about Earth, our home planet?<p class="message sent">Yes, mommy, and did you know that Earth is the only planet with life on it?<p class=message>Yes, that's true, and we are so lucky to have it as our home. So, what are you going to be when you grow up?<p class="message sent">I want to be a doctor, so I can help people and make them feel better.<p class=message>That's a great ambition, B. You'll make a wonderful doctor one day. Here's our food guys, let's dig in!<p class="message sent">Mmm, this fish is so tasty, and the fries are crispy too!<p class=message>And this salad is the perfect balance of flavors. I love coming to this restaurant. It always exceeds our expectations.<p class="message sent">Me too, daddy. Can we come back here next week for my birthday?<p class=message>Sure thing, sweetie. We'll have a big celebration with all your friends.<p class="message sent">Yay, I can't wait! Thanks, mommy and daddy, for everything.<p class=message>Anytime, darling.
