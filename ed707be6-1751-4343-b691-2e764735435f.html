I'm excited to learn some local seafood recipes today.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Fisherman A! I'm glad you're excited. We're going to make some delicious dishes with the freshest catch of the day.<p class=message>That sounds fantastic! What's on the menu?<p class="message sent">We'll start with some Tasmanian salmon fillets with a herb butter sauce. Then we'll move onto BBQ oysters with garlic butter and lemon. Finally, we'll finish with a classic seafood chowder.<p class=message>Wow, I can't wait to try all of those. So, where do we start?<p class="message sent">First, let's clean the salmon fillets and season them with salt and pepper. Then we'll let them sit while we prepare the butter sauce.<p class=message>Got it. While we're waiting, can you tell me about the history of this recipe?<p class="message sent">Sure! This dish goes way back to the early settlers of Tasmania who relied heavily on seafood. They would often cook salmon over open fires and add herbs that grew wild in the area.<p class=message>That's really interesting. Okay, I think the salmon is ready for the sauce.<p class="message sent">Great! Let's mix together some butter, garlic, and a selection of herbs. Then we'll baste the salmon with the mixture and grill it for a few minutes on each side.<p class=message>Yum, it smells amazing! What's next?<p class="message sent">Next, we're going to shuck some oysters and add garlic butter and lemon juice. Then we'll pop them on the BBQ for a couple of minutes until they're heated through.<p class=message>Mmm, that sounds perfect for a summer day. And finally, the seafood chowder?<p class="message sent">Yes. We'll start with a creamy broth and cook in some Tasmanian seafood- prawns, scallops, and fish- along with some potatoes, corn, and herbs.<p class=message>This day just keeps getting better and better! Thanks so much for sharing these recipes with me, Chef B.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, Fisherman A. I hope you learned a lot and enjoy your delicious seafood feast.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed6f15bf-7179-45c3-9e07-6ec9e3863b13.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
