I am so excited to be heading to Australia Gold Coast today.<p class="message sent">Good morning, ma'am! Yes, it's a beautiful place. What brings you here?<p class=message>Well, I really needed a break from work and wanted some adventure. Plus, the beaches here are amazing, aren't they?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! The shores here are a sight to behold. Have you decided on what to do first?<p class=message>Hmm, I know I want to visit the theme parks, but I also want to swim in the ocean.<p class="message sent">How about you take a dip at Surfers Paradise Beach first? It's really popular and it's so refreshing.<p class=message>That sounds nice, will we be passing by that area on the way to our hotel?<p class="message sent">Certainly! And you might even see some surfers riding the waves.<p class=message>Oh, that would be so cool! So, how long have you been driving a taxi in Gold Coast?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for 10 years now. It's a great way to earn a living while also getting to meet new people every day.<p class=message>I can imagine. Do you have any funny stories about your passengers?<p class="message sent">Well, I once had a passenger who thought they were in a race car and kept making car engine noises the whole ride.<p class=message>Haha, that's hilarious! I hope I won't be too boring of a passenger for you.<p class="message sent">No way, I'm sure we'll have a great time! Oh, we're here at the beach. Enjoy your swim and have a wonderful stay!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ca754fee-152b-476e-8404-6eff6ac76914.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
