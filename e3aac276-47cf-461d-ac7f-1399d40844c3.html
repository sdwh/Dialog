I can't believe I'm standing in front of the famous Kiyomizu-dera Temple.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's an amazing temple. Did you know it was built in 778 AD?<p class=message>Really? That's so old! I bet there's a lot of history behind it.<p class="message sent">Yes, there is. Kiyomizu-dera is known for its cliffside architecture and its main hall has a stage that juts out over a cliff.<p class=message>That sounds scary yet intriguing. Can we go see it?<p class="message sent">Of course! But be careful not to fall off the stage. They say if you survive the fall, your wish will come true.<p class=message>Thanks for the warning! I'll be sure to hold onto the railing. What else can you tell me about this place?<p class="message sent">Well, Kiyomizu-dera means "pure water temple" and the water from the Otowa waterfall here is said to have healing powers. Visitors can drink from one of three streams, but shouldn't drink from all three as it's considered greedy.<p class=message>That's interesting. I'd love to try it out. Oh, and check out those lanterns hanging up there. They look so beautiful!<p class="message sent">Yes, they are called chochin, traditional Japanese lanterns made with paper or silk. They are used to light up the temple at night for special events.<p class=message>I can imagine how romantic and magical it must look. Do they still hold events here?<p class="message sent">Yes, several events are held here throughout the year, including cherry blossom viewings in spring and colorful autumn foliage in fall.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. I'm already planning my next visit here. Thanks for being such a great guide and showing me around, B!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. It's my pleasure to introduce you to the beauty of Kyoto. Let's go explore more of this city together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e3a888a0-4c68-4543-972e-48287be9b010.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
