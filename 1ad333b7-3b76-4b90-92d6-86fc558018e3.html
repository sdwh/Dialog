How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm great, thanks for asking! Where are you headed today?<p class=message>I'm going to Taipei for a business meeting. What about you?<p class="message sent">I'm just doing my usual taxi runs, hopefully picking up some interesting passengers like yourself.<p class=message>That's cool! Do you have any interesting stories from your time as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh, I definitely do. I remember one time a passenger left their wallet in my car, and it was filled with cash. I returned it to their address and they ended up giving me a big tip as a thank you.<p class=message>Wow, that's amazing! You definitely did the right thing there. Have you ever had any weird requests from passengers?<p class="message sent">Actually, there was one passenger who asked me to play the theme song from a popular TV show on repeat during their whole ride. It was quite the experience.<p class=message>Haha, I bet that was a memorable ride for both of you. So, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for about ten years now. It's definitely had its ups and downs, but I enjoy it overall.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've always appreciated the service that taxi drivers provide. Do you have any advice for me as a first-time visitor to Taipei?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out the night markets - they have some of the best street food in the world. And if you have time, take a ride up Taipei 101 for a stunning view of the city.<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestions, I'll definitely keep them in mind. We're almost at my destination - how much do I owe you?<p class="message sent">The total comes out to 500 NT dollars. Have a safe and productive meeting!<p class=message>Thank you, I will. Have a great day and happy driving!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1ac99904-b8f4-4748-92d7-f5d25016e80d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
