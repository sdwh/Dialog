I'm just in the mood for something sweet, so I thought I'd try my hand at baking a cake.<p class=message>That sounds like fun! Would you like some help?<p class="message sent">Yes please, I don't really know what I'm doing.<p class=message>Don't worry, baking is all about following a good recipe. What kind of cake are you making?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of making a classic vanilla cake with buttercream frosting.<p class=message>Yum! Have you got all the ingredients?<p class="message sent">Yes, I got them all from the store yesterday. Let's get started!<p class=message>Okay, first things first. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease the cake pan.<p class="message sent">Got it. Do we mix the dry and wet ingredients separately?<p class=message>Yes, that's right. The recipe says to whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in one bowl, and then in another bowl, you mix the sugar and butter until it's light and fluffy.<p class="message sent">Okay, this is starting to make sense. What's the next step?<p class=message>Next, you add the eggs one at a time, and then mix in the vanilla extract.<p class="message sent">I'm so excited! This is looking like cake batter!<p class=message>It sure is. Now, we just pour the batter into the pan and bake it for 30-35 minutes.<p class="message sent">Mom, it smells amazing in here! I can't wait to taste it!<p class=message>I am excited too! While it's baking, we can start making the buttercream frosting.<p class="message sent">How do we do that?<p class=message>We start by beating the butter until it's soft and creamy, and then we gradually add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract.<p class="message sent">Got it. This is actually a lot of fun!<p class=message>It's always fun to learn something new. Now, let's finish up the frosting so we can decorate the cake.<p class="message sent">This is the best cake I've ever made!<p class=message>You did a great job! I knew you could do it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5c0332a0-c4f3-4a46-bef5-c1d2d1acd713.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
