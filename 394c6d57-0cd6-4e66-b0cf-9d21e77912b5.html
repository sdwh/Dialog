How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. I feel a lot better than yesterday. Thanks for the medication you gave me.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. How was your sleep last night?<p class="message sent">It was great, actually. The bed is so comfy that I slept like a baby.<p class=message>That's wonderful. Do you have any special requests for your meals today?<p class="message sent">I'm craving for some mac and cheese. Do you think it's possible?<p class=message>Of course! I'll make sure to inform the kitchen. Anything else you'd like to have?<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe a fruit salad for dessert?<p class=message>Noted. By the way, did you know that the hospital has a library for patients to borrow books?<p class="message sent">Really? That's cool. Do they have any good books?<p class=message>Yes, there are plenty of new releases and classic novels. I actually borrowed 'The Great Gatsby' the last time I had a day off.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, I love that book! Can I borrow it from you when you're done?<p class=message>Sure, no problem. That way we can discuss it during my rounds.<p class="message sent">Sounds great, thanks. So, what's the plan for my treatment today?<p class=message>The doctor will be here in an hour to check on you. We'll go through your progress and, if there are any changes, we'll adjust your medication accordingly.<p class="message sent">Okay, thanks for letting me know. You know, you're really good at your job, A. You always make me feel better.<p class=message>Aww, that's so kind of you to say. I just want you to feel comfortable and get better soon.<p class="message sent">You're doing a great job. Thank you.<p class=message>You're welcome. I'll see you later, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3944fc42-69df-4da0-b7b5-146b5e3a5be7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
