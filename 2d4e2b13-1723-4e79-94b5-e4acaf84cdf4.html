It's a great job, it's like being a tour guide in your own city.<p class=message>That's really great! Do you have any recommendations for places to visit in Paris?<p class="message sent">Hmm, well if you're looking for a good view, I recommend visiting the Montparnasse Tower. And if you're a fan of art, the Louvre is a must-visit.<p class=message>Those are great suggestions, thank you! By the way, what kind of music do you like to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of classic rock, especially Queen and The Rolling Stones. What about you?<p class=message>I love pop music, especially Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran. But I also enjoy some old-school R&B.<p class="message sent">That's cool. You can hook up your phone to the car speakers and play your own playlists if you want.<p class=message>That's awesome! Say, have you ever had any unusual customers?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes, I've met some interesting people over the years. Once, I had a passenger who was carrying a huge cactus plant as a gift for his girlfriend.<p class=message>Wow, that's unusual indeed. My weird experience was when I left my phone in a cab and the driver drove back to my house to return it.<p class="message sent">That's a rare but nice thing. We drivers know how important it is to keep our passengers happy.<p class=message>Absolutely. Thanks for being a great driver!<p class="message sent">No problem, it's my pleasure. We're here in Paris, I hope you enjoy your stay!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2d4e0434-4e78-4b1d-841b-08a2a40075c9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
