I've been looking forward to this all week.<p class=message>Great, let's warm up with some jogging and stretching first.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, I definitely need to get my blood flowing before we start.<p class=message>So, have you played much beach volleyball before?<p class="message sent">Not really, I've only played indoor before.<p class=message>No problem, we'll start with the basics and work our way up.<p class="message sent">That works for me, thanks for being patient with me.<p class=message>Of course, it's my job as a coach to help you improve. Alright, let's get started with some serves.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll try my best!<p class=message>Nice job, you're a natural! Let's move on to some passing.<p class="message sent">This is a bit harder for me, but I'll keep practicing.<p class=message>That's the spirit! Remember to keep your hands together and your arms straight when passing.<p class="message sent">Got it, thanks for the tip.<p class=message>Okay, now let's try some hitting. I'll toss the ball to you and you try to hit it over the net.<p class="message sent">This is my favorite part! Watch out, I'm going to smash it!<p class=message>Haha, I like your enthusiasm. You're doing great so far.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I really appreciate your support.<p class=message>Alright, let's finish off with a few games. We'll split into teams and see who can score the most points.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a fun way to end the session. Let's do this!<p class=message>Great job today, you've really made progress.<p class="message sent">Thank you! I can't wait to come back for more training next week.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6073ec26-3ebe-49f9-bf70-51262eee9936.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
