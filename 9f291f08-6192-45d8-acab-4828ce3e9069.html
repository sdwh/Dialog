Can you help me with that?<p class="message sent">Of course! What kind of room are you looking for?<p class=message>Something comfortable with a nice view would be great. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Well, we have a room with a balcony that overlooks the city. Would you like to take a look?<p class=message>That sounds perfect! How much would that cost?<p class="message sent">It's currently priced at $200 per night. Is that within your budget?<p class=message>A bit on the high side, but I think it's worth it. Can you give me more information about the amenities in the room?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. The room comes with a king-size bed, a mini-fridge, a flat-screen TV, and a private bathroom with complimentary toiletries.<p class=message>Hmm, that all sounds great, but I'm a bit concerned about the noise level.<p class="message sent">Oh, don't worry about that. We've recently installed soundproofing in all our rooms, so you won't be disturbed by any outside noise.<p class=message>Alright, that seals the deal for me! Can you go ahead and make the reservation for me?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'll just need your name and contact details to complete the booking.<p class=message>My name is John Smith, and my phone number is 555-1234.<p class="message sent">Alright, Mr. Smith, your reservation is confirmed. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>No, that's all. Thank you very much for your help!<p class="message sent">You're very welcome, Mr. Smith. We look forward to welcoming you to our hotel!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9f272e35-9896-456d-b333-1af7214314f4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
