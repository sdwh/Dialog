Can you tell me a little bit more about your business and what you are looking for in terms of design?<p class="message sent">Sure. My business is a gourmet popcorn shop, and I'm looking for a fun and creative logo that will catch customers' attention.<p class=message>I love that idea! Have you thought about incorporating any specific colors or images into your logo?<p class="message sent">Yes, I was thinking of a popcorn kernel with some bold and bright colors - maybe red or yellow?<p class=message>Definitely! How about we use a bold font for the business name and incorporate the popcorn kernel into the letters?<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! I love the idea of the kernel being part of the letters.<p class=message>And we can also play around with some different font styles to really make it stand out.
