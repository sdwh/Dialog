The customers are starting to flock in.<p class="message sent">It's going great, Boss A. Everything is sizzling and smelling delicious.<p class=message>That's good to hear. We need to keep up with the demand, it's a busy night tonight.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'm on top of it. The yakitori is already marinated and skewered, and the meat is tenderizing in the fridge.<p class=message>Perfect. We don't want to keep our customers waiting for too long. Speaking of which, have you tried the new dipping sauce I made?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. It's a game-changer, Boss A. Sweet and savory, with just the right amount of heat.<p class=message>Glad you like it. I was inspired by my recent trip to Tokyo. Their street food scene is amazing.<p class="message sent">I heard that. I hope we can visit Tokyo someday and learn more about their cuisine. But for now, we should focus on satisfying our customers here in Osaka.<p class=message>Absolutely. And speaking of customers, look at that group of teenagers over there. They seem to be enjoying their grilled squid.<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. I saw them taking selfies and posting on social media. It's nice to see that our food not only tastes good but also looks good on camera.<p class=message>That's the power of presentation. And the taste, of course. We should also remind our customers to try our miso soup and pickled vegetables. They are perfect complements to our grilled items.<p class="message sent">Good idea, Boss A. I'll make sure to mention that to them. Oh, and by the way, we're running low on beer. Should I go to the store and get more?<p class=message>Yes, please. And get some sake while you're at it. Let's make sure our customers have a good time tonight.<p class="message sent">Got it, Boss A. I'll be back in no time.<p class=message>Thanks, Chef B. Keep up the good work. Our customers deserve the best.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e84ba5f1-d795-400e-b3d0-668f29fffed7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
