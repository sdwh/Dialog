How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too. So, let's get into the financial reports. How's everything going with your business?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thanks for asking. Our profits have increased by 15% since last quarter.<p class=message>That's great news! Any major changes in expenses?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually we've been able to cut back on our advertising expenses due to increased word-of-mouth referrals.<p class=message>Word-of-mouth referrals are always the best kind of advertising. Have you been able to invest any of your profits back into the business?<p class="message sent">Yes, we've been able to purchase some new equipment and we're also considering expanding our services.<p class=message>Nice, I'm glad to hear that. Have there been any challenges recently that we need to address?<p class="message sent">We did have a minor setback when one of our suppliers went bankrupt, but we were able to quickly find a new supplier with better prices.<p class=message>Excellent, that's proactive business management. Well, it looks like everything is on track. Thanks for coming in today, Mr. B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It's always a pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4b51c3b7-2fae-4100-a143-73a0447183b4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
