You must be the system administrator.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. Nice to meet you. So, we've been tasked with developing a reliable electronic voting system for a government agency.<p class=message>Yes, it's quite a challenge but also exciting. Have you given it any thought?<p class="message sent">I have a few initial ideas, but I'm interested in hearing yours.<p class=message>Well, first we need to ensure the security of the voting data. We can use encryption technology to mitigate against hackers.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. We also need to make sure the system is user-friendly so that elderly voters can navigate it with ease.<p class=message>Absolutely. We can adopt a similar interface to the online banking system, which is user-friendly.<p class="message sent">We can also use biometrics to verify the voter's identity, such as facial recognition and fingerprint scanning.<p class=message>I agree. We can also have data backup for the server in case of any technical failure.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. How about the issue of internet connectivity in some remote areas?<p class=message>We can create a mobile app that allows for offline voting and uploading the results once the device connects to the internet.<p class="message sent">Smart solution. We also need to have strict regulations on cybersecurity measures.<p class=message>Yes, we can work with cybersecurity experts to ensure compliance with standards.<p class="message sent">Lastly, we need to ensure transparency and accuracy in the announcement of election results.<p class=message>I suggest we use a blockchain system to keep track of the voting and counting process.<p class="message sent">Excellent suggestion. Thanks for the great ideas. Let's get to work and make it happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=549b5f27-fed9-48d2-80f7-eb6b049894c0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
