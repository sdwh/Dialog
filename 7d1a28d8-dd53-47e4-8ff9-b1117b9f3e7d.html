This park has got a huge slide. Do you want to go first, or should I?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Dad, I think I should go first. I don't want you to stick in the middle.<p class=message>(laughs) You're right. I wouldn't want to get stuck in there. Go ahead, climb up and have fun.<p class="message sent">(Excitedly) Wheeee! This is so much fun! I feel like I'm flying!<p class=message>(Laughs) That smile on your face tells it all. Are you ready to go again?<p class="message sent">(nodding) Yes, but can we go together this time?<p class=message>(smiling) Of course, hop on my lap and let's slide down together.<p class="message sent">(giggles) Yay! (Hold tight to her dad) This is so cool. I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster.<p class=message>(excitedly) Me too! You're the best slide buddy I could ask for.<p class="message sent">(grinning) You're the best dad in the world.<p class=message>(surprised) Aw, thanks, honey. That's the sweetest thing you've said all day.<p class="message sent">(laughing) Well, it's true. (Looks up at the clouds) Hey, dad, look at those fluffy clouds. Don't they look like animals?<p class=message>(looking up) You're right! That one looks like a bunny. Do you see it?<p class="message sent">(amazed) Yes! And that one looks like a dragon. What do you see?<p class=message>(pointing) That one looks like a dinosaur! It's chasing the bunny!<p class="message sent">(laughs) This is so much fun. Can we stay here and look at clouds all day?<p class=message>(smiling) Sure, we can stay as long as you want. I enjoy spending time with you, kiddo.<p class="message sent">(happy) I love spending time with you too, dad.<p class=message>(patting her head) Alright, let's go look for other things in the park. Maybe we can find some more fun stuff to do.<p class="message sent">(nodding) Yay!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7d12a59c-e438-4a5d-bea8-2e73586b09b7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
