I'm the ice cream maker. What can I help you with today?<p class="message sent">Hey! I'm the owner of the dessert shop next door. I have a proposition for you.<p class=message>Sure, shoot!<p class="message sent">We were thinking of partnering up to offer our customers a special overnight delivery service for ice cream and desserts.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea! How would we go about it?<p class="message sent">Well, we were thinking customers can order from our dessert shop until midnight, and then we'll deliver the orders to you for next-day pickup.<p class=message>Okay, and what flavors were you thinking of offering?<p class="message sent">We were thinking of some classic flavors like strawberry and chocolate, but also some unique flavors like lavender and honey or Earl Grey tea.<p class=message>Yum, those sound delicious! And for the desserts, we could offer some classics like apple pie and cheesecake, as well as some vegan and gluten-free options.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And we could also include some toppings like sprinkles, nuts, and hot fudge sauce.<p class=message>Perfect! So how many orders are we thinking of delivering each day?<p class="message sent">We can start small, let's say 10 orders a day, and see how it goes from there.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. We can set a fixed price for each order and split the profits 50-50.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's get started on this and make it a success!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4385f0ec-3a13-4fea-97c0-fc4d93b8403b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
