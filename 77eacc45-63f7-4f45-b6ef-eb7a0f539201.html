It's great to see you again.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Yes, it's been a while. What brings you here today?<p class=message>Actually, I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of opening a new coffee shop in Lucerne.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about it?<p class=message>Sure! My business partner and I have been thinking about opening a place that serves amazing coffee and pastries in a cozy and welcoming environment.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea! What kind of pastries do you have in mind?<p class=message>We're thinking of offering a variety of options, from classic croissants and muffins to more unique and artisanal desserts.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! Have you thought about location and decor yet?<p class=message>Yes, we've been eyeing a space in the city center that's both accessible and has a lot of foot traffic. And we're thinking of keeping the decor simple but stylish, with wooden accents and lots of plants.<p class="message sent">I think that's a great concept. What kind of coffee will you be serving?<p class=message>We'll be sourcing our beans from local roasters and offering a variety of blends and single-origin choices. And of course, we'll have all the classic espresso-based drinks as well.<p class="message sent">I'm sold! When are you thinking of opening?<p class=message>We're aiming for a soft opening in about three months, with a grand opening shortly after. Would you be interested in visiting us and trying some of our coffee once we're up and running?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I can't wait to see what you've come up with. Let's stay in touch and make sure to coordinate.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=77e95544-dcd0-47e2-8f10-79a3ea31745d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
