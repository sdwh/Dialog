Do you have any insight on that?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct. Our team is growing and we need to make sure everyone has access to the right tools.<p class=message>Definitely. I'm just wondering which type of license we should get. Would the standard one be enough?<p class="message sent">Well, it depends on our usage. If we're planning to use more advanced features such as encryption or machine learning, we might need the Enterprise edition.<p class=message>That's a good point. I think it would be a good idea to make a list of our requirements and see which edition would fit our needs the best.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We also need to keep in mind the number of cores we have in our servers. Each core requires a separate license, so we don't want to waste money on unnecessary licenses.<p class=message>Hmm, I didn't realize that. Thanks for letting me know. What about CALs? Should we get them as well?<p class="message sent">Yes, each user or device accessing SQL Server requires a CAL. We can either purchase them individually or get them as part of a bundle with the license.<p class=message>Got it. It sounds like we have a lot to consider. But I'm confident that we can make the right decision if we gather all the necessary information.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'll work on compiling a list of our requirements, and we can go from there.<p class=message>Sounds great. Thanks for your help, B. I really appreciate it.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always good to make sure we're using our resources efficiently.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cc8fe0b1-a7c0-485f-9627-6f3afa1251e4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
