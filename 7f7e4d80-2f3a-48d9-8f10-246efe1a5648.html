Thank you for coming to my concert.<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm excited to hear you play tonight.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. Which instruments do you like the most?<p class="message sent">Hm, tough question...but I do love the sound of the piano.<p class=message>Ah, the piano is a beautiful instrument. I'll make sure to play some of my favorite piano pieces for you.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! So, where did you study music?<p class=message>I studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. It's a great school with amazing teachers.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. How long have you been playing music?<p class=message>I started playing the violin when I was five years old, so it's been about 20 years now.<p class="message sent">That's a long time! What's your favorite piece to play?<p class=message>I think my favorite is Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. It's a challenging piece, but it's so beautiful.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. Speaking of challenges, have you ever had any mishaps during a performance?<p class=message>Oh yes, I've had my fair share of mishaps. Once, I dropped my bow in the middle of a piece!<p class="message sent">(laughs) That must have been embarrassing. But I'm sure the audience understood.<p class=message>(chuckles) Yes, they were very kind. Have you been to many concerts at the Opera House before?<p class="message sent">A few, but this is my first time seeing a violinist perform live.<p class=message>Well, I hope you enjoy it! Do you have a favorite genre of music?<p class="message sent">I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to music, but I do love a good rock concert.<p class=message>Interesting! I'll have to try incorporating some rock elements into my performance next time.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That would be something to see! So, what's next on your list of performances?<p class=message>I'll be playing at the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra next week. It's a big venue, but I'm excited for the challenge.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! Best of luck to you.<p class=message>Thank you! I hope to see you at my next concert.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'll be sure to bring some friends along too.<p class=message>Wonderful! Thank you for your support. Enjoy the rest of the performance.<p class="message sent">You too! Thanks again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7f7d73bb-7d90-4c76-8225-a5080128562c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
