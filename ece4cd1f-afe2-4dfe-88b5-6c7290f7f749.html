How about you?<p class=message>Great, thanks! So, what's on the agenda for today?<p class="message sent">We need to talk about your upcoming shows.<p class=message>Awesome! What do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">Well, we have a few options. There's a music festival in July, a comedy tour in August, and a TV appearance in September.<p class=message>Hmm...I'm leaning towards the music festival. I love performing outdoors.<p class="message sent">Good choice! It's a three-day event with some big names on the bill. You'll be on the main stage on the second day.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! What about the comedy tour?<p class="message sent">It's a smaller tour, but still a great opportunity for exposure. We're thinking of hitting some college towns and comedy clubs.<p class=message>Sounds fun, but I think I'll pass this time. I want to focus on the music festival.<p class="message sent">Not a problem. We're also looking into a TV appearance on a popular talk show in September to promote your new album.<p class=message>Now that's definitely something I'm interested in. Can we get some more details on that?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We're in talks with the producers and should have some solid info for you soon.<p class=message>Sounds good! Thanks for keeping me in the loop, B.<p class="message sent">Of course! That's what I'm here for. Anything else on your mind?<p class=message>Nope, that's it for now. Let's get started on preparing for the music festival.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Time to rock and roll!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ece44777-9d09-4e31-b671-9b46ea18d5c8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
