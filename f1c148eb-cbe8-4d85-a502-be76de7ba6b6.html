I'm excited to explore the market today.<p class="message sent">Hi there! Welcome to Tsukiji Fish Market. I am your guide for today.<p class=message>Thanks for showing me around. What's the secret to finding the freshest seafood?<p class="message sent">It's all about the eyes. Assess the color, texture, and smell. If it looks bright, firm, and smells like the ocean, you're good to go.<p class=message>Wow, I never knew that. What's the most popular seafood here at the market?<p class="message sent">Tuna, definitely. It's usually sold by weight and can get pretty pricey. But it's worth every penny.<p class=message>I'll definitely have to try some. Do you have any recommendations for sushi restaurants in the area?<p class="message sent">There are plenty of great sushi restaurants nearby. My personal favorite is Sushizanmai. It's always crowded, but definitely worth the wait.<p class=message>I appreciate the suggestion! Have you ever tried making sushi at home?<p class="message sent">Of course! It takes a bit of practice, but it's really fun once you get the hang of it.<p class=message>Any tips for a beginner sushi-maker like myself?<p class="message sent">Start with simple rolls and focus on getting the rice and filling proportions just right. And don't forget to use fresh ingredients!<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for all the helpful tips, I can't wait to start cooking.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Enjoy your time at the market and happy cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f1b759c8-8157-4a1b-9e3d-b85f27c69ba1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
