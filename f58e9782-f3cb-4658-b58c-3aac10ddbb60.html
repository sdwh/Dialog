Can you take me to Wuhan, please?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Do you have any preferences on the route we take?<p class=message>Hmm, not really. Just as long as we get there safely.<p class="message sent">No problem, ma'am. So, what brings you to Wuhan?<p class=message>Just visiting some friends there. How about you, driver? Do you like driving long distances like this?<p class="message sent">Oh, I don't mind it at all. Gives me a chance to see the country. Plus, I get to have interesting conversations with passengers like you.<p class=message>That's nice to hear. Do you have any funny or interesting stories from your experiences as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Let's see...well, there was this one time where a passenger left their pet snake in the car. I almost had a heart attack when I saw it slithering around!<p class=message>Oh my! That's quite a surprise. Do you enjoy pets?<p class="message sent">Not really a fan of snakes, to be honest. But I've had some nice experiences with passengers' dogs and cats. They're always so friendly.<p class=message>Yes, pets can be great companions. Speaking of companions, what kind of music do you like listening to on the road?<p class="message sent">I enjoy a bit of everything, from classic rock to jazz. How about you?<p class=message>I'm more of a pop music fan myself. But maybe we can find some common ground with some 80s hits?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Let's put on some Huey Lewis and the News.<p class=message>Perfect! I always find that music puts me in a good mood. How much longer till we reach Wuhan?<p class="message sent">We're about halfway there, so maybe another hour or so. Anything else I can help you with in the meantime?<p class=message>No, thank you. Just enjoying the ride.<p class="message sent">Great, glad to hear it. And if you need anything else, just let me know. That's what I'm here for.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f589061b-4131-4202-bfa2-a365da3dd64b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
