Have you decided what you would like to order?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon, thank you. I'm afraid I'm spoiled for choice, everything on the menu looks delicious!<p class=message>Well, if you're a fan of seafood, I highly recommend our authentic Spanish seafood paella, it's a specialty of the house.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds perfect! Could you tell me what it includes?<p class=message>Certainly! It's made with saffron rice, mussels, clams, prawns, chicken and chorizo sausage. It's quite popular with our customers!<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! Could we also get some tapas to share before the main course?<p class=message>Absolutely, we have a variety of tapas to choose from, including garlic prawns, stuffed olives, and calamari rings. Which would you prefer?<p class="message sent">Let's go with the garlic prawns and stuffed olives, please.<p class=message>Excellent choices! I'll get started on the paella now, it will take a little bit of time to cook, but it's definitely worth the wait!<p class="message sent">No problem, we're not in a hurry. This restaurant has a lovely atmosphere, how long has it been open?<p class=message>Thank you for the compliment! We've been open for about five years now. We pride ourselves on our traditional Spanish recipes and fresh ingredients.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! I've always wanted to visit Spain, what do you think is the best time of year to go?<p class=message>I would say the best time is in the summer months, from June to August when the weather is warm and sunny. There are also many festivals and cultural events going on during that time.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great time to visit! I'll definitely keep that in mind when I plan my trip. Thank you for the recommendation.<p class=message>You're welcome! Your tapas are ready, please enjoy them while I finish preparing your seafood paella.<p class="message sent">Thank you very much, everything looks and smells delicious!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ca127972-4f7f-4347-8375-48221594b684.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
