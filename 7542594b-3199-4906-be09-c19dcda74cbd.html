Welcome to Sydney International Airport. How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning. Yes, thank you. I'm here for a business trip and looking to arrange some transportation and accommodation.<p class=message>Of course, sir. What type of transportation do you prefer? Taxi, limousine or would you like me to arrange for a rented car?<p class="message sent">I think a rented car would be ideal. Can you suggest any good rental companies in the city?<p class=message>Absolutely! There are many reputable car rental companies in Sydney such as Hertz, Avis, and Budget.
