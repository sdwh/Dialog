What kind of countries can I choose from?<p class=message>We have partner institutions all over the world, from Europe to Asia and even Australia. It really depends on your interests and language abilities.<p class="message sent">I've always been interested in learning Spanish. Are there any programs in Spain or Latin America?<p class=message>Absolutely! We have exchange programs with universities in Spain, Mexico, Colombia, and more. Let me pull up some information for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much. Is there any financial assistance available for the exchange program?<p class=message>Definitely. We have scholarships and grants available for students who need financial assistance.

Do I need to speak another language fluently to participate in the program?<p class=message>It depends on the specific program, but most of them don't require fluency in another language. However, having some basic knowledge of the language can go a long way.<p class="message sent">Good to know.
