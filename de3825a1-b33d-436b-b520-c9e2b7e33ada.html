Ready for some beach volleyball training?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A! I’ve been looking forward to this all week.<p class=message>Great to hear! So, first things first – have you ever played beach volleyball before?<p class="message sent">I’ve played a few times with friends, but I’ve never had any formal training.<p class=message>No worries, we’ll start with some basic skills. Let’s work on your serve first.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. What should I focus on?<p class=message>Well, for starters, make sure to toss the ball high enough and hit it with a nice, firm wrist snap. And remember to snap your shoulders and hips in the direction where you want the ball to go.<p class="message sent">Got it. How do I improve my accuracy?<p class=message>That takes practice. Just keep practicing your serve and focus on hitting specific targets on the court. Ready to give it a shot?<p class="message sent">I’m ready!<p class=message>Nice job, B! That was a great serve. Let’s move on to passing now.<p class="message sent">Okay. Do I just pass it to you?<p class=message>Yep! We’ll start with some simple back and forth passes first. Remember to keep your hands firm and low, and use your legs to adjust your body position.<p class="message sent">Got it. This is much tougher than it looks!<p class=message>It definitely takes some practice, but you’ll get the hang of it soon enough. Okay, last up – hitting. We’ll start with some basic approaches and hits.<p class="message sent">Okay. What’s the key to a good hit?<p class=message>Well, it’s all about timing and form. Make sure to time your approach so you’re hitting the ball at the apex of your jump. And remember to snap your wrist and follow through with your arm.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me give it a shot.<p class=message>Nice job, B! Your form is looking great. Keep practicing those skills and you’ll be a beach volleyball pro in no time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=de3002d2-9a34-4c99-bbfe-5a1fa9b15c55.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
