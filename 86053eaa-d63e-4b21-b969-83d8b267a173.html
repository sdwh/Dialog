How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi Dr. A, I've been feeling pretty down lately and thought some counseling might help.<p class=message>Sure, it takes courage to reach out for help. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?<p class="message sent">Well, I've been experiencing a lack of motivation and interest in the things I used to enjoy. I also feel tired all the time.<p class=message>Hmm, those are common symptoms of depression. What do you think might have triggered these feelings?<p class="message sent">I'm not really sure. Perhaps it's the stress of school and upcoming exams.<p class=message>Ah, stress can certainly take a toll on our mental health. Have you tried any self-care practices like exercise or relaxation techniques?<p class="message sent">I have been trying to exercise more, but it doesn't seem to be making much of a difference.<p class=message>Well, it's important to find what works best for you. Maybe try exploring other hobbies or interests to see if they bring you joy.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. I've always wanted to try painting.<p class=message>Perfect, that sounds like a great way to express yourself and alleviate stress. Remember, taking care of our mental health is just as important as taking care of our physical health.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Dr. A. I really appreciate your advice.<p class=message>You're welcome. Remember, I'm here to support you on your journey towards better mental health.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=86043899-f1a8-4dfe-a905-2045e94f8a93.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
