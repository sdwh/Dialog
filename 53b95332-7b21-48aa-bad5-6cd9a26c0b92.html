My name is Adam, and I will be your guide for the day. Is this your first time in the Queensland rainforest?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. I'm really excited to experience the wildlife and natural beauty here.<p class=message>That's great to hear! We will be exploring the rainforest on foot, so make sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring plenty of water. Our first stop will be a waterfall that's hidden deep in the forest.<p class="message sent">I love waterfalls! Is it a big one?<p class=message>It's not the biggest one in the area, but it's still pretty impressive. You can even take a dip in the pool at the bottom if you're feeling adventurous.<p class="message sent">Count me in! What kind of wildlife might we see on the tour?<p class=message>There are a lot of different animals that live here, such as wallabies, possums, and even the occasional koala. But we'll have to keep our eyes peeled because they can be quite elusive.<p class="message sent">I'm excited to see a koala in the wild. I've only ever seen them at the zoo.<p class=message>Well, we'll do our best to spot one for you. But even if we don't, there are plenty of other interesting plants and insects to admire along the way.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. What's your favorite thing about leading these tours?<p class=message>Honestly, I love seeing people's reactions when they see something new or unexpected. It's amazing how much nature has to offer if you take the time to look for it.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. I think this will be a really special experience. Thanks for being our guide, Adam.<p class=message>My pleasure! Let's get going and see what we can discover today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=53b76e01-d595-44c7-8352-db17f35a0d94.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
