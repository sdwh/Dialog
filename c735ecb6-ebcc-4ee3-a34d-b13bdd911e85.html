Can I help you with something?<p class="message sent">Hi! Actually, I'm a market researcher and I'm doing a survey on the product displays in this supermarket. Could you tell me how you decide on where to place products?<p class=message>Of course! We generally follow the principles of eye-level shelving and product grouping based on categories. But sometimes we have to mix it up depending on the promotions we have going on.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. Is there a specific product that keeps getting moved around by customers or doesn't seem to sell well?<p class=message>Well, the cereal aisle is always a challenge. We try to keep the best-sellers at eye-level, but some people are really loyal to certain brands and tend to dig around for them. And as far as low-selling products, we'll try moving them to different areas of the store to see if it helps.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Have you noticed any changes in customer behavior or preferences lately?<p class=message>Definitely! Health-conscious options and organic products are becoming more popular. And with the pandemic, we've seen an increase in people buying staple items like rice and flour in bulk.<p class="message sent">That's really good to know. I appreciate your insight. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me!<p class=message>No problem, happy to help! Good luck with your research!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c734645c-7051-43b4-9fa6-3195e5e0157b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
