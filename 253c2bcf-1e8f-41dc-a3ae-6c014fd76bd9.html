We've caught a bunch of vulnerabilities that we wouldn't have found manually.<p class=message>That's awesome. What kind of vulnerabilities have you been finding?<p class="message sent">Mostly input validation issues and some buffer overflows. But we also found a few instances of hardcoded passwords!<p class=message>Yikes, that's definitely a no-no. Have you been able to fix those issues?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we've been working on it. It's been a bit of a pain to change all the hardcoded passwords, but we found a really clever way to do it using encryption.<p class=message>Nice, I'm glad we have people like you working on it. Speaking of clever solutions, have you seen the latest internet meme about code reviews?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What is it?<p class=message>It's a picture of a bunch of cats sitting around a computer and the caption says "code review by the purring committee". It's hilarious.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's great. It's nice to know that even in the serious world of software development, we can still have a little bit of fun.<p class=message>Absolutely. Hey, did you hear there's going to be a company-wide ping pong tournament next month?<p class="message sent">No way! I've been practicing my serve for weeks now. You better watch out, A.<p class=message>Oh, it's on, B. It's on. But first, let's get back to fixing those vulnerabilities. We've got work to do!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=253bd746-5d49-4fb8-b3bd-f976d583c3d6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
