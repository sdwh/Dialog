How's your weekend?<p class="message sent">Hi A! My weekend was great, thanks for asking. How about yours?<p class=message>Likewise, it was a good break from work. But we have to get back to business today, let's talk about work progress.<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm all ears. What's the latest update?<p class=message>Well, we've been working hard on the project and I think we're making good progress. But I noticed that there were a few delays, what happened?<p class="message sent">Sorry about that A, I was out sick for a couple of days, but I'm back now and ready to catch up on what I missed.<p class=message>No problem, the important thing is that you're back on your feet. We need you, B! Speaking of which, how do you feel about the project overall?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I'm excited about it. I think we're onto something big and I can't wait to see the final result.<p class=message>I agree, it's a challenging project but I think we're up for it. By the way, have you tried that new coffee place down the street? I heard they have amazing lattes.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But thanks for the recommendation! Maybe we can grab some after the meeting, it'll boost our productivity.<p class=message>Sounds like a great idea. But first, let's go over the project timeline and see if we need to make any adjustments.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, let's get to it. But seriously, let's make a latte date happen. Our taste buds deserve it.<p class=message>You got it, B. Let's conquer the project and then conquer some lattes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ffee1dc6-15ea-42b6-8486-e5b3a0a9fe3f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
