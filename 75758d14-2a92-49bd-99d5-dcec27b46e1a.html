I'm planning a trip to Estonia and I need some advice on what places to visit.<p class="message sent">Hi! Sure, I'd be happy to help. Estonia is a beautiful country. What kind of things are you interested in?<p class=message>Well, I love exploring historical sites, learning about different cultures, and trying local cuisine.<p class="message sent">Great! In that case, you should definitely visit the old town of Tallinn. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has some of the best preserved medieval architecture in Europe. You can also try some delicious Estonian dishes like elk stew and black bread.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! What else is there to see and do?<p class="message sent">I'd also recommend visiting the Lahemaa National Park. It's one of the largest national parks in Estonia and has a variety of habitats and wildlife. You can also tour the KGB Museum in Tartu and learn about Estonia's Soviet past.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds fascinating. Are there any festivals or events happening during my visit?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually! If you're coming in the summer, there's the Viljandi Folk Music Festival which has been held annually since 1993. It's the biggest and most popular folk music festival in the Baltics.<p class=message>I'm definitely interested in that. Thank you so much for all the suggestions!<p class="message sent">Of course, happy to help. Is there anything else you need assistance with for your trip?<p class=message>No, that's everything for now. Thanks again!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, have a great trip to Estonia!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=75700d97-5739-4944-9ae5-47705c108b40.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
