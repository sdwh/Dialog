I'm so excited to see you mix up some of those famous Swiss alcoholic drinks.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What can I get for you?<p class=message>How about an Absinthe? It's one of the most popular Swiss drinks.<p class="message sent">Ah, the famous "green fairy." Coming right up.<p class=message>So, what's the history behind it?<p class="message sent">Well, Absinthe was originally used as a medicinal drink in the 18th century but became popular among the artists and writers in the 19th century.<p class=message>I've heard there's a myth that it can make you hallucinate. Is that true?<p class="message sent">There's no scientific evidence to support that myth, but the high alcohol content can certainly have an effect.<p class=message>Wow, this tastes amazing. What other Swiss drinks do you recommend?<p class="message sent">You have to try "Rivella", the Swiss national soft drink. It's a carbonated beverage made from milk serum.<p class=message>That sounds unique. Anything else?<p class="message sent">For a strong and classic Swiss drink, try "Kirsch." It's made from distilled cherries and has a smooth taste with a slight sweetness.<p class=message>I would love to try that too. Say, do you have any tips for drinking in moderation?<p class="message sent">Yes, always stay hydrated, alternate your drinks with water, and listen to your body's signals. And never drink and drive.<p class=message>Thank you for those helpful tips, and this unforgettable experience. I can't wait to come back for more.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Cheers to a great evening!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6535fcce-67c4-48f9-94d0-37bd353e84ff.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
