It's going pretty good. I've almost finished this dress.<p class=message>Wow, that looks great! You're really talented.<p class="message sent">Thanks, mom. I've been practicing a lot lately.<p class=message>I remember when I used to make your clothes when you were little. You loved wearing the dresses I made for you.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I remember all those cute little dresses. I'm glad you taught me how to sew.<p class=message>Me too! It's a great skill to have. What are you going to wear that dress for?<p class="message sent">I thought I'd wear it to school tomorrow. Do you think it's fashionable enough?<p class=message>Of course! You look stunning in it. All your friends will be jealous.<p class="message sent">Thanks, mom. That makes me feel better.<p class=message>Is there anything else you need help with?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm not sure how to fix this seam. It's a bit wonky.<p class=message>Let me have a look... Oh, I see what you mean. Here, give me the needle and thread. I can fix it for you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, mom. You're the best.<p class=message>No problem, sweetie. That's what moms are for.<p class="message sent">I'm really glad we can spend this time together, just the two of us.<p class=message>Me too, honey. It's important to take the time to do these things together.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it makes me feel closer to you.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. You know, we should make this a regular thing. We can have a sewing night every week.<p class="message sent">That sounds like so much fun! But you have to promise you won't make fun of my wonky seams.<p class=message>I promise. And who knows, maybe I can even learn a thing or two from you.<p class="message sent">Haha, that would be funny. We can teach each other.<p class=message>Absolutely. Now, let's get back to sewing. We've got lots to do.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dee4d330-2bf1-4afb-b945-51fec884da29.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
