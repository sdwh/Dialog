How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain, just trying to finish up this batch of cookies.<p class="message sent">Oh, those smell amazing! What are they?<p class=message>Chocolate chip, my personal favorite.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. Do you make all the bakery items here?<p class=message>Yep, everything is made fresh daily.<p class="message sent">That's pretty impressive. Must be hard work.<p class=message>It definitely keeps me busy, but I enjoy it. Plus, seeing customers enjoy the products makes it worth it.<p class="message sent">Speaking of customers, do you have any special deals going on today?<p class=message>Sure do. Buy one bakery item, get one free.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a great deal. I'll have to let customers know.<p class=message>Please do! And if you need any samples, just let me know.<p class="message sent">Will do. So, how long have you been working in food processing?<p class=message>About 4 years now. I started off in a small bakery before coming here.<p class="message sent">That's great. Did you always know you wanted to do this kind of work?<p class=message>Actually, no. I studied graphic design in college, but fell into the food industry by chance.<p class="message sent">That's funny how things work out sometimes. Do you ever miss graphic design?<p class=message>Sometimes, but I still get to be creative with the bakery items. And I enjoy the physical aspect of the job.<p class="message sent">I can see that. Well, keep up the great work! I better let you get back to it.<p class=message>Thanks, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8aba2954-77eb-4aad-971e-1c5963074360.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
