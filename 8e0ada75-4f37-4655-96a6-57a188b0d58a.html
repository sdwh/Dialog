Can you describe the pain and how long you have been experiencing it?<p class="message sent">It's a dull ache and I've been having it for about a week now.<p class=message>Have you been eating any new or unusual foods lately?<p class="message sent">Not really, but I have been eating a lot of spicy foods.<p class=message>Ah, I think I might know what's going on. It sounds like you might have gastritis.<p class="message sent">What is that?<p class=message>It's inflammation of the stomach lining, often caused by eating spicy foods, stress or excessive alcohol consumption.<p class="message sent">Oh no, I didn't know eating spicy food could cause this. Is there anything I can do?<p class=message>Yes, I recommend avoiding spicy foods for the time being and taking some antacids to relieve the symptoms. And of course, try to manage your stress levels as well.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Doctor A. I will definitely try to make those changes.<p class=message>No problem, B. And hey, look on the bright side, at least it's not anything serious like appendicitis!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yes, that's true. I'm just glad it's nothing too serious.<p class=message>(smirks) Of course, you'll still need to pay me for my diagnosis.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Don't worry, Doctor A. I won't forget that part.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8e0a5ca2-2e5e-4f85-823b-e5a316f23377.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
