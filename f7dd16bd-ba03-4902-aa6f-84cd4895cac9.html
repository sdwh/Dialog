Welcome to our restaurant. How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Bonsoir! I would like to try your most authentic French cuisine.<p class=message>Ah, excellent choice sir. May I recommend our popular dish, the coq au vin? It is a delicious chicken dish cooked in red wine.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing. I'll have that please. Can you tell me how it's prepared?<p class=message>Of course! We use the finest ingredients, marinate the chicken overnight in red wine and then slowly cook it with mushrooms, pearl onions, and bacon until the meat is tender and the sauce is rich.<p class="message sent">My mouth is watering just hearing about it. And what about for dessert?<p class=message>Our crème brûlée is not to be missed. The custard is infused with vanilla and then topped with a caramelized sugar crust.<p class="message sent">That sounds heavenly! I'll have that too please.<p class=message>Great choices, sir. I'll send your order to the kitchen right away. Would you like to pair it with a glass of our recommended wine?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. I trust your recommendation.<p class=message>May I suggest a glass of our Château Lafite Rothschild? It pairs perfectly with the coq au vin and has a smooth, velvety texture with hints of black currant and spice.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect, I'll take it.<p class=message>Excellent, sir. Your food and wine will be ready shortly. Is there anything else you need from me?<p class="message sent">No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. Enjoy your meal, sir!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f7d8b93f-4c73-4cc9-a394-8ba5c335bf61.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
