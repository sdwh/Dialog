How are you doing today, driver?<p class="message sent">I'm doing fine, thanks for asking. How about you? Where are you heading?<p class=message>I'm going to the famous Red Fort in Delhi. Have you been there?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes. It's a must-visit place if you are in Delhi. It's one of the most beautiful historical buildings in the city.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, how long have you been a taxi driver in Delhi?<p class="message sent">Well, it's been around ten years now. I love this city, it's vibrant and there's always something new to discover.<p class=message>That's amazing. Have you had any interesting experiences while driving in Delhi?<p class="message sent">Yes, I certainly have. One time, a monkey tried to steal my lunch while I wasn't looking!<p class=message>(laughing) That's hilarious! Did you manage to get your lunch back?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yes, thankfully. The tourists in my car helped me by shooing the monkey away.<p class=message>Wow, I'm glad to hear that you had some helpful customers. Speaking of food, do you have any restaurant recommendations for me in Delhi?<p class="message sent">Yes, if you are looking for some delicious Indian food, you should definitely try Karim's. It's a local favorite and it's been around for over 100 years!<p class=message>(intrigued) Sounds great. What kind of dishes do they offer?<p class="message sent">They have a variety of dishes, but their specialty is their mutton biryani. It's simply mouth-watering.<p class=message>(already craving) I can't wait to try it. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. It's always a pleasure to help out tourists in my city.<p class=message>I can tell that you are a great ambassador for Delhi.<p class="message sent">(smiling) It's my home, after all. I just want everyone who visits to have a great time here.<p class=message>I'm already having a great time. Thanks for the company and the conversation, it's been lovely.<p class="message sent">Likewise. Enjoy your time at the Red Fort, and have a great rest of your day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9c8205ab-95b4-40d6-bd50-01b757ceb131.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
