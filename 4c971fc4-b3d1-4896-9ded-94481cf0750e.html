Is it really effective?<p class=message>Absolutely! It saves so much space in your luggage and keeps your clothes wrinkle-free.<p class="message sent">That sounds pretty amazing. What kind of vacuum bags do you use?<p class=message>I usually go for the ones with a one-way valve. They're really easy to use and they're reusable!<p class="message sent">Reusable? That's a game-changer. And where do you get them?<p class=message>You can find them at any home goods store or online. Just make sure you get ones that are the right size for your items.<p class="message sent">Got it. Do you have any tips for packing things like jackets or bulky sweaters?<p class=message>Actually, I saw a trick where you can roll them up and use compression packing cubes. It helps save even more space!<p class="message sent">That's genius. I always struggle with packing those kinds of items. How many outfits can you usually fit in one bag?<p class=message>It really depends on how much you want to bring. But I usually end up fitting around 7-8 outfits with room for a few accessories too.<p class="message sent">Nice! Thanks for all the tips. I'm definitely going to try vacuum sealing for my next trip.<p class=message>No problem at all. Happy packing! And don't forget to leave some room for souvenirs!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4c8916c5-0774-44d3-8e82-5f64413b7c27.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
