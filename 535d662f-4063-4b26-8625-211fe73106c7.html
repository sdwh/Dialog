How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! I'm good, thanks for asking. How about you? How's the coffee roasting going?<p class=message>It's going great! I'm always happy to roast the perfect beans. So, what type of coffee are you thinking of using for your customer's latte?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I was thinking maybe some Colombian beans? But hey, you're the expert. What do you think?<p class=message>I have some Ethiopian beans that I think would taste amazing in a latte. They have a lighter roast profile, and a fruity taste that would really enhance the milk.<p class="message sent">That sounds great! Let's go with Ethiopian beans then. Is there anything I can help you with in the roasting process?<p class=message>Actually, would you like to try roasting some beans yourself today? I could teach you.<p class="message sent">Really? That would be awesome! I'm excited to learn.<p class=message>Alright, let's start by choosing which beans to roast. Have you ever tasted the difference between light, medium, and dark roast beans?<p class="message sent">Not really, but I'm curious to learn.<p class=message>Great! Then let's get started. First, we need to preheat the roaster to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.<p class="message sent">Got it. Wow, this is hotter than I expected.<p class=message>Yeah, roasting coffee beans is a delicate process, and the temperature needs to be just right. Here, let me show you how to place the beans inside the roaster.<p class="message sent">Whoa, this is so cool! I can't wait to see how the beans transform.<p class=message>It's definitely one of the most satisfying parts of being a coffee roaster. And voila! Our fresh Ethiopian beans are ready for your baristas to make some delicious lattes.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I appreciate all your help. Your passion for coffee is infectious.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, B. I'll see you soon for another roast session!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=535997cd-46d0-41f3-85ef-d458ba9b002b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
