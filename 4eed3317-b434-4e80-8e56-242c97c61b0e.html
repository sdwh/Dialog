I see you're interested in my fresh produce.<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! Your vegetables look so colorful and delicious.<p class=message>Thank you! They're all grown locally, right here in Champagne.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Well, our heirloom tomatoes are always a hit. They're so sweet and juicy.<p class="message sent">Oh, perfect! I can definitely use those in my salads. How much are they?<p class=message>They're three euros a pound. We also have some beautiful peppers that go great with them.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll take a few of those as well. Your stand is such a visual feast, it's hard to decide just what to buy!<p class=message>I hear that a lot! We also have some tasty zucchini and eggplant, if you're interested.<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think...yes, I think I'll grab some of each. And do you have any fruit today?<p class=message>Absolutely! We have some fresh strawberries that just came in this morning.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love strawberries! How much are they?<p class=message>They're two euros for a pint. And check out our peaches, too - they're perfectly ripe.<p class="message sent">Yum, I'll definitely take some of those too. Thank you so much!<p class=message>My pleasure. And don't forget to come back next week, we're getting some new crops in.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely be back. Have a great day!<p class=message>You too, thanks for stopping by.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4eeb98a5-a0bd-4631-86d5-ffb145a7cb05.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
