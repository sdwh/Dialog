The weather is fantastic today, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! It's going to be a great day for driving to Kyoto.<p class=message>I'm excited! It's my first time visiting Kyoto. Do you have any must-see spots to recommend?<p class="message sent">Of course! You have to visit Kinkakuji, the Golden Pavilion. It's stunning, especially in the sunlight.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. How about food? What's your favorite Kyoto dish?<p class="message sent">I highly recommend trying the traditional tofu dishes, especially yudofu. It's a hot pot style tofu dish that is delicious and healthy.<p class=message>That sounds tempting, I'll definitely try it. Hey, do you have any funny stories from driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">Well, once I had to drive a bride to her wedding, but she forgot her wedding dress at home. We had to make a quick stop at her house before heading to the wedding venue.<p class=message>Oh no! Did she make it on time?<p class="message sent">Yes, luckily we still had enough time. It was a close call though!<p class=message>Haha, that's a good one. It's always interesting to hear stories from drivers. Thank you for sharing.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. We're almost in Kyoto now. Are you staying in a hotel or visiting someone?<p class=message>My friend lives there, so I'm staying at her place. Do you have any advice on navigating around the city?<p class="message sent">Public transportation is convenient, but if you have time, renting a bike is a great way to explore the city.<p class=message>That's a great idea, thank you. Thanks for the ride and advice!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Have a great time in Kyoto!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4482440b-1cc5-43dd-befc-395940dcbf6b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
