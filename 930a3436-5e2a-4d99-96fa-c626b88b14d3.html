They're known for their vibrant colors and beak-like teeth.<p class=message>Oh cool! I didn't know that. What other interesting marine creatures have you encountered?<p class="message sent">I've seen schools of jellyfish, graceful manta rays, and even a playful group of dolphins.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. It's crazy to think about how many different species inhabit the ocean.<p class="message sent">Yeah, there's still so much we don't know. Did you know that scientists estimate there could be up to 1 million undiscovered species in the ocean?<p class=message>No way! That's mind-blowing. I guess we have a lot more exploring to do.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And as marine scientists, it's important that we work to protect these species and their habitats.<p class=message>Absolutely. Speaking of which, did you see that campaign to ban single-use plastics on this boat?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! It's great to see efforts being made to reduce our impact on the environment and protect these amazing marine creatures.<p class=message>Agreed. Hey, do you want to grab some lunch and continue our discussion on marine biodiversity?<p class="message sent">Sure, sounds good to me. I heard the chef is making some delicious seafood dishes today.<p class=message>Perfect!
