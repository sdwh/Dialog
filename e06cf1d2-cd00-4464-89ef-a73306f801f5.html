How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing alright. We have a lot of work to do today, don't we?<p class="message sent">Yes, we certainly do. The ISO 27001 audit is coming up soon.<p class=message>That's right. I hope you've been able to review all of the necessary documents.<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's quite a lot to go through, but I think we're prepared.<p class=message>Great. I'm glad to hear that. So, how did you end up in the IT department, anyway?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a funny story. I actually started out in marketing, but I realized that my passion was for technology.<p class=message>That's interesting. I guess it just goes to show that you never know where your career path will take you.<p class="message sent">Definitely. So, have you seen any good movies lately?<p class=message>Actually, I just watched a really funny comedy the other day. Have you heard of "Superbad"?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. That's a classic. It's always good to have a laugh.<p class=message>Agreed. It helps take the edge off of all this auditing work we have to do.<p class="message sent">That's for sure. But we'll get through it together.<p class=message>Yes, we will. And then we'll have a good reason to celebrate.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Let's plan on grabbing a drink after the audit is complete.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I look forward to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e06a38a7-d691-4025-adf4-1dba4619b5f8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
