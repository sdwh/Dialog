I would like to inquire about the process of refunding my ticket.<p class="message sent">Of course! May I know what's the reason for the refund?<p class=message>Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it to my flight anymore due to some unforeseen circumstances.<p class="message sent">I'm sorry to hear that. In that case, we can initiate the refund process for you. May I have your ticket number, please?<p class=message>Sure. It's 123456789.<p class="message sent">Great. You should receive your refund within 14 business days. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>Actually, I was thinking of changing my flight instead of just canceling it. How can I do that?<p class="message sent">That's possible. You can choose a new flight and pay the difference in fare, if there's any. Would you like me to check for available flights?<p class=message>Yes, please. I would really appreciate it.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me just search for you. By the way, do you have any preferred airline meal?<p class=message>Oh, I didn't think of that. Can I request for a vegetarian meal?<p class="message sent">Sure! Noted with thanks. Okay, I found some available flights for you. How about this one – a direct flight, departing tomorrow at 10 AM?<p class=message>Perfect! That would be great. How much is the fare difference?<p class="message sent">Let me check… looks like it's only $50. Is that okay with you?<p class=message>Yes, that's totally fine. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! I'll just process the changes for you. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly. Have a great flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d4caf1b0-0196-44a6-899f-9da42186a85a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
