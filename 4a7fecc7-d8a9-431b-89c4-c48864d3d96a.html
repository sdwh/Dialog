I'm excited to work on building a scalable data processing system together!<p class="message sent">Hi A, it's great to meet you too! Definitely looking forward to diving into this project.<p class=message>So, I was thinking of using Apache Kafka as a message broker. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. It's a reliable, distributed messaging system that can handle a high volume of data. But we also need to consider the storage aspect of things.<p class=message>Exactly. For that, I was thinking of using Amazon S3 for object storage, as it's highly available and durable.<p class="message sent">Good choice. But what about processing and querying the data?<p class=message>For processing data, we could use Apache Spark or Flink as they can operate in a distributed environment. As for querying, we could use Elasticsearch.<p class="message sent">I agree, Elasticsearch is a solid option for searching and analyzing data. How about monitoring and managing the system?<p class=message>We could use Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualizing the data. And for managing the system, we could use Kubernetes.<p class="message sent">Those are great choices. Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containers at scale.<p class=message>Yeah, I've used it before and it's definitely a game-changer. Overall, I think we have a good plan for building a scalable data processing system.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'm excited to get started on this project with you, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4a7780fa-549d-4a5a-8cb8-40c9f5c838d4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
