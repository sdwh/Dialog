It's going to be developed using jQuery and ASP.NET MVC 5, right?<p class=message>Yes, that's right. So, what's your take on jQuery? Do you think it will be an effective tool for this project?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm not really thrilled about using jQuery. I'm more of a React guy, but I guess we'll have to make it work.<p class=message>Ha-ha, yeah, I understand. But jQuery seems to be the popular choice for this kind of project, so we have to stick with it.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. On the other hand, I'm excited to use ASP.NET MVC 5. It's a powerful framework with a lot of useful features.<p class=message>Yes, I agree. It makes it easy to develop scalable and maintainable web applications.<p class="message sent">Definitely. So, do you have any specific ideas for the website design or features?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of implementing a responsive design so that it works well on different devices.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. We should also focus on user experience and efficient data management.<p class=message>Agreed. Also, we should definitely test the website thoroughly for any bugs or issues.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Testing is a crucial part of the development process to ensure that the website runs smoothly.<p class=message>We have quite a lot to do, but I'm looking forward to working together on this project.<p class="message sent">Same here. I'm sure we'll make an awesome team!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c1074bf2-7655-43c0-837c-96067f341366.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
