Hop in and make yourself comfortable, it's going to be a pleasant ride.<p class=message>Great! I heard the city is beautiful this time of year.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. Have you ever been there before?<p class=message>No, it's my first time. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely visit the Confucius Temple and the Zhonghua Gate. And you have to try the dumplings!<p class=message>Oh, I love dumplings! Do you have a favorite place?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. It's a small, family-owned stall near the drum tower. Their dumplings are the best I've ever had.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I can't wait to try them.<p class="message sent">Don't forget to try the local specialty drinks too.<p class=message>What kind of drinks?<p class="message sent">There's the soured milk and the osmanthus wine. They're both quite unique.<p class=message>Interesting, I'll give them a try. So, do you like being a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a good job. I get to meet new people and see new places every day.<p class=message>That sounds nice. I'm a programmer, so I sit in front of a computer all day.<p class="message sent">Ah, that can get boring sometimes.<p class=message>Yes, it can. But I love solving puzzles and creating new things, so it's worth it.<p class="message sent">That's great. We all have our passions and interests that keep us going.<p class="message sent">Here we are. I hope you enjoy your stay in Nanjing.<p class=message>Thank you so much for the pleasant ride and the recommendations.<p class="message sent">You're welcome.
