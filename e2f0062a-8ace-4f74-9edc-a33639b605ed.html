And how about the IT team, did they encounter any difficulties in the new software implementation?<p class="message sent">No, boss. They were able to smoothly transition to the new software, and we have experienced an increase in productivity across all departments.<p class=message>That's great news, everyone. Now, let's discuss the upcoming office party.
