Any new ideas on how to develop a better self-driving system for our autonomous car project?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Yeah, I think we could use a more advanced AI system to enhance the car's cognitive abilities.<p class=message>Great idea! But, do you think all of our competitors are already using that technology?<p class="message sent">Well, according to our latest market research, only a few of them use it yet.<p class=message>Okay, then let's implement it quickly before they catch up.<p class="message sent">Sure, we need to train the AI system with very diverse datasets to make sure it makes right decisions in different regions, intersections and road types.<p class=message>That sounds fair, do you have any idea where we can get such datasets?<p class="message sent">There is a driving simulator at the university we can use for that.<p class=message>Let's book it then. But how long do you think it will take to train the AI?<p class="message sent">With our powerful servers and machine learning algorithms, it shouldn't take us longer than a couple of weeks.<p class=message>Perfect, and then we can do some trials on actual roads to check if the decision-making process is optimal.<p class="message sent">Exactly, but we need to make sure we aren't violating any traffic laws during those trials.<p class=message>Oh, don't worry, we will make sure to follow all the legal protocols.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. Another important factor is the UI design, it should be user-friendly for the drivers.<p class=message>Agreed. Maybe we could even use 3D graphics to make it more intuitive.<p class="message sent">Sounds awesome! And we can also add voice-activated commands for the car.<p class=message>Nice touch! But, will it understand all accents and dialects?<p class="message sent">It will be a challenge, but we can use the latest NLP techniques to improve its accuracy.<p class=message>Perfect! Let's brainstorm some more ideas over coffee, we need to make our autonomous car a standout in the market!<p class="message sent">Totally agree, let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed68fd6a-f73a-4bca-b039-c761c523c47b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
