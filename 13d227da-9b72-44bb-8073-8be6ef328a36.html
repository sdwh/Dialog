How are you doing today, B?<p class="message sent">I'm doing pretty good, thanks for asking. It's been busy since we opened, as usual.<p class=message>Yeah, it seems like everyone is in a hurry to get their caffeine fix these days.<p class="message sent">Definitely! So, what can I get started for you?<p class=message>I was actually wondering if you could recommend a new drink for me to try?<p class="message sent">Sure, we have a new seasonal drink called the "Caramel Apple Latte." It's made with espresso, steamed milk, caramel sauce, and a hint of apple flavor.<p class=message>That sounds delicious, I'll have to try it!<p class="message sent">Great! And, would you like to add a pastry or breakfast sandwich to your order?<p class=message>Hmm, what do you recommend?<p class="message sent">I personally love the blueberry muffins, but the bacon and egg croissant is also very popular.<p class=message>I think I'll go with the croissant. Thank you!<p class="message sent">No problem, that will be $7.50. And how about you, sir? What can I get started for you?<p class=message>Just a regular coffee for me, please. And could I get a splash of cream?<p class="message sent">Of course, coming right up. Have you tried any of our new pastries yet?<p class=message>I haven't, actually. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">The almond croissants are definitely a customer favorite, or our lemon poppy seed scones are also very popular.<p class=message>Hmm, those both sound good. I'll go with the almond croissant.<p class="message sent">Excellent choice! And that brings your total to $4.25. Will that be all for you today?<p class=message>Yes, thank you. How's your day been, B? Busy as usual?<p class="message sent">Definitely, but it keeps things interesting! Plus, I get to meet so many different people.<p class=message>That's true. And your latte art skills are impressive, I'm always impressed by the designs you come up with.<p class="message sent">Aw, thank you! I've been practicing a lot lately.<p class=message>Well, keep up the good work! Here's your tip.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=13ce4ad6-7ecc-4f73-8107-53bac7d22cf4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
