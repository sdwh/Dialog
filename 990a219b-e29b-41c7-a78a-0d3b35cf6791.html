How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks. Just getting started on prepping for tonight's service.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I wanted to touch base with you about the specials for tonight. Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking of trying out a new dish - a grilled Caesar salad with blackened shrimp.<p class=message>Sounds interesting! Let's definitely give it a try. How's everything looking with the ingredients and inventory?<p class="message sent">We're good to go. But we'll need to order more shrimp in the next few days.<p class=message>Duly noted. By the way, have you seen the new wine list we received yesterday?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. The sommelier did an excellent job curating the selection.<p class=message>Agreed. And don't forget, we have a big party coming in this weekend for a celebration. We need to make sure everything is perfect.<p class="message sent">No worries. We'll have the entire team working together to make sure it's an unforgettable evening for them.<p class=message>That's the spirit! And before I forget, I wanted to remind you about the staff meeting tomorrow morning.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the heads up. I'll make sure to have everything organized for the team.<p class=message>Perfect. And speaking of organization, have you checked in with the front-of-house team to ensure we're all on the same page for tonight's service?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. We're good to go.<p class=message>Excellent. You're always on top of things, Chef B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It's always a pleasure working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9905dce9-0bfa-480c-b7da-87186da99dce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
