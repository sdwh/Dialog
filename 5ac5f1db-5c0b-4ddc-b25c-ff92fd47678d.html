Welcome to our farm. Are you here for some fruit picking?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Yes, I am. I've never done it before, so I'm excited to try it out.<p class=message>Well, you're in for a treat. We have an abundance of fruits here, from apples to peaches and everything in between.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Which ones are ready to be picked right now?<p class=message>Let's see, the apples and pears are ripe and ready to be picked. We also have a section for the stone fruits like peaches, nectarines and plums.<p class="message sent">Great! I think I'll start with the apples. Do I just climb up the ladder and pick them from the tree?<p class=message>Yes, that's right. Be careful not to shake the tree too hard or the good ones will fall and get bruised.<p class="message sent">Got it. This is hard work! I have a newfound respect for farmers.<p class=message>Haha, yes, it can be tough work. But it's worth it when you get to bite into a juicy, ripe fruit.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Do you have any tips for picking the best fruits?<p class=message>Look for the ones that are firm and free from blemishes or soft spots. And make sure the color is uniform all around.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tips. I'll keep that in mind. Can I try some of the fruits right now?<p class=message>Of course! We have a tasting area set up for that. And while you're at it, try some of our homemade apple cider too.<p class="message sent">Mmmm, this is delicious. Is it made from the apples we picked?<p class=message>Yes, it is. We have our own cider press and we make fresh batches every day.<p class="message sent">I'm definitely buying some to take home with me. Thank you so much for the wonderful experience.<p class=message>You're welcome! We're happy to share our farm with visitors like you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ac3ce7c-5e48-4be2-8033-904ca79ab691.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
