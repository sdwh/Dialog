I used to walk here with my dad when I was your age.<p class="message sent">Really? That's cool. What did you guys do here?<p class=message>We used to have picnics near the pond and feed the ducks. Want to try that?<p class="message sent">Yeah, sure! Do you have any bread?<p class=message>Here you go. But don't feed them too much or they'll get too lazy.<p class="message sent">Got it. Hey, why are there so many people on that side of the park?<p class=message>Oh, that's the dog park. People take their dogs there to play and socialize.<p class="message sent">Can we go check it out?<p class=message>Sure thing! But remember, we don't have a dog, so let's just observe.<p class="message sent">Wow, there are so many dogs. That little one is so cute!<p class=message>That's a Pomeranian. They're small but have a lot of energy.<p class="message sent">I wish we had a dog. Can we get one?<p class=message>Well, having a dog is a big responsibility. We'll have to talk about it more as a family.<p class="message sent">Okay, I understand. Thanks for taking me here dad, this has been great!<p class=message>Anytime son. Let's finish our walk and go get some ice cream. How does that sound?<p class="message sent">Awesome! Let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6224f1d3-ae7a-4498-8917-195d10cdc974.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
