I went hiking with some friends. How was yours?<p class=message>It was good too. I went out to eat with my family. So, let's talk about the meeting with our boss, what do you think?<p class="message sent">Sure. Our boss is always so busy, but he's great at delegating tasks. I think we can handle anything he throws our way.<p class=message>Agreed. I'm glad we have you as his secretary. You always keep everything organized.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Thank you, but you're the one who always knows how to make him laugh during meetings. It helps to break the tension.<p class=message>(smiling) I try my best. I know he can be a bit intimidating, so I always try to lighten the mood.<p class="message sent">It definitely makes the meetings more enjoyable. By the way, have you heard about his recent hobby?<p class=message>No, what's that?<p class="message sent">He's taken up painting! I'm excited to see what he comes up with.<p class=message>(laughing) That's interesting. I hope he doesn't start painting pictures of us in the office.<p class="message sent">(jokes back) Oh no, I don't want to be immortalized in paint forever. Let's hope he sticks to landscapes.<p class=message>(both laugh) Yeah, hopefully. In all seriousness, let's make sure we're well-prepared for the meeting. I have a good feeling about it.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. We make a great team, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7ad9c53d-fc8e-47b6-919d-9c0f95c36120.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
