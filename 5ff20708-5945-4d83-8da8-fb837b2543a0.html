Hmm, not bad. But try to keep your knees in line with your toes.<p class=message>Got it, thanks. So, did you watch the game last night?<p class="message sent">I sure did. What a comeback by our team!<p class=message>Right? That last minute goal was insane. I need to step up my training, I want to be as fit as those players.<p class="message sent">You'll get there. Just remember to focus on your technique and listen to your body.<p class=message>Speaking of which, I've been wanting to try those new TRX straps. Do you think they're worth it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. They engage your core and help build stability. Let's give it a go.<p class=message>Alright, let's do this. *struggles to maneuver the straps* Wow, this is harder than it looks.<p class="message sent">You're doing great. Just keep your core tight and breathe through the movement.<p class=message>*pants* This is a killer workout. How many sets do we have left?<p class="message sent">Just one more, you got this. And then we can enjoy a protein shake, my treat.<p class=message>You know the way to my heart, coach. *grins* Thanks for pushing me today.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. Keep up the hard work and you'll reach your fitness goals in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ff09b01-c6b8-441b-89ab-c6a3acbb1893.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
