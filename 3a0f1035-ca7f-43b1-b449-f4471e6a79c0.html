Are you catching anything?<p class=message>Yeah, I've caught a couple of breams and a flathead already. Do you need any tips on how to catch them?<p class="message sent">That would be great! This is my first time fishing in Australia, and I don't know much about the fish here.<p class=message>No problem, mate. First, you need to bait your hook with some prawns or live worms. Second, cast your line near the rocks or the weeds, that's where the fish usually hang out.<p class="message sent">Wow, thanks for the advice! You seem like a pro at this.<p class=message>Yeah, been fishing since I was a little tacker. It's my favorite pastime.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. Mind if I fish next to you?<p class=message>Of course not, mate! The more, the merrier. Watch me catch a big one now!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Alright, let's see it. You've got quite the confidence.<p class=message>(after a few minutes of casting) Ah, finally! (pulls out a fish from the water) See that? That's a good one right there.<p class="message sent">Nice catch! That looks like a big snapper.<p class=message>Right you are! You've got a good eye, mate. You wanna try catching one?<p class="message sent">Sure, let me try following your advice. (casts his line) Oh, I think I've got somethingâ€¦<p class=message>That's the spirit! Now reel it in, careful not to let it slip away.<p class="message sent">(pulls out a fish) Hey, I caught one! I think it's a flathead.<p class=message>(laughs) You're getting the hang of it! Keep practicing, and you'll be a pro like me in no time.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Thanks, I'll take that as a compliment. This was really fun, I might have to come fishing more often.<p class=message>You should. It's a great way to spend the day and relax. Plus, you get to eat what you catch!<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Alright, I'm gonna give it another shot. Thanks for your help, mate.<p class=message>Anytime. Tight lines!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3a0bd746-3510-4efe-b0e4-b729b69cf940.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
