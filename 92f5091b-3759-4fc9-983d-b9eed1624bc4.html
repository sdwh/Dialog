How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm great, ready for another busy day. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. I'm excited to see more locals and tourists stopping by our stand.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And I have to say, your bread is fantastic. It really complements my coffee.<p class=message>Thank you, B. Your coffee also brightens up my morning.<p class="message sent">Speaking of morning, have you tried our new espresso blend? It has hints of chocolate and caramel.<p class=message>No, I haven't. That sounds delicious!<p class="message sent">I can make you a cup right now if you'd like.<p class=message>That would be amazing! And why don't I give you a freshly baked croissant to go with it?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a perfect combination. Thank you, A!<p class=message>Of course. By the way, do you have any fun plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Not really. Just planning to catch up on some sleep and explore more of Nice. How about you?<p class=message>Actually, I have a baking class on Saturday. I'm learning how to make macarons!<p class="message sent">That sounds like fun. Can you bring some back for us to try?<p class=message>Definitely. And maybe I can teach you how to make bread next time.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a deal! We could have a cooking class exchange.<p class=message>That's a great idea. Let's plan it soon. But for now, let's enjoy our coffee and croissant.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Thanks, A. You make the best croissants in town.<p class=message>And you make the best coffee in town. We make a great team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=92efe76e-8956-4912-b7ca-faec0a9fe24b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
