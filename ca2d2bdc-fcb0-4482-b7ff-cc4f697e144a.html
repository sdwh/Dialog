Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, you know that classic movie where they have advanced electronic voting systems. It got me thinking if we can build a system that would work for the government.<p class="message sent">I get your point, but isn't that risky? What if someone hacks it?<p class=message>Yeah, you're right. I guess we need to make sure it's reliable and secure enough to handle voting.<p class="message sent">Exactly, we can't afford any data breach. People need to trust the system for it to work.<p class=message>How about a biometric system? It could prevent anyone from casting a vote more than once.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. It's foolproof, and there's no way someone can vote for another person.<p class=message>It can also reduce lines significantly, which would help people access a voting machine quickly.<p class="message sent">Yes, and it would improve the overall experience for voters. But, we need to test it first to make sure it works without any issues.<p class=message>Agreed, it should be tested multiple times in different scenarios. We can't afford to have any technical problems on election day.<p class="message sent">Let's also involve experts on this to ensure that we're on the right track.<p class=message>Sure, this is not an easy task, but it's worth it if we can deliver a reliable and efficient electronic voting system.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, let's get to work then. We have a lot of work to do, but I'm excited about this opportunity.<p class=message>Me too, B. This is an exciting project to work on.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ca28dea3-d288-4303-8553-0e25db46d299.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
