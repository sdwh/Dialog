How did you sleep last night?<p class="message sent">Oh, good morning, dear. I slept like a baby. Thanks for asking.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Have you thought of any fun activities you'd like to do today?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'd love to play some cards or maybe even learn how to knit.<p class=message>Oh, knitting is one of my favorite hobbies. I could teach you if you'd like.<p class="message sent">That sounds wonderful! You'll have to be patient with me though, I've never knitted before.<p class=message>Not a problem, Mr. B. Knitting is very relaxing, and it's easy to pick up. We can start after breakfast.<p class="message sent">Wonderful! That sounds like a plan. Speaking of breakfast, what's on the menu today?<p class=message>We have some cereal, toast, and eggs made to order. What's your preference?<p class="message sent">I think I'll go for some toast with a boiled egg. How about you?<p class=message>I had some oatmeal earlier, but I'm always up for some toast. Let me go get your breakfast for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, dear. You're such a kind and helpful assistant.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, Mr. B. I enjoy taking care of you and making your day a little brighter.<p class="message sent">You definitely do that, A. I don't know what I'd do without you.<p class=message>Aw, thank you. That's so sweet of you to say. Alright, let me go grab your breakfast, and we can start our knitting lesson after that.<p class="message sent">I'm looking forward to it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4dba4a40-794a-4b31-9740-4fa16e6a4b2f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
