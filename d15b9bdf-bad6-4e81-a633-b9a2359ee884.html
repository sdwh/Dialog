But I'm not that good at soccer.<p class=message>No worries, we can practice together and improve our skills. Plus, being on the soccer team can help us get noticed by a certain someone.<p class="message sent">Who are you talking about?<p class=message>You know who I'm talking about. The girl you like who always goes to the soccer games.<p class="message sent">Oh, her. I didn't know she was into soccer.<p class=message>Yep, she's a big fan. And trust me, being on the team will give us an edge in catching her attention.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'm in. But where do we even start?<p class=message>Let's start by watching some soccer games online and studying the strategies. We can also practice our passing and dribbling skills.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. But what if we don't make the team?<p class=message>Don't worry about that. We can still improve our skills and maybe even start our own pickup games with other students.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. Maybe we can even start a soccer club.<p class=message>Yes! And we can invite that girl to join us.<p class="message sent">That would be awesome. I'm excited to start practicing and see where this goes.<p class=message>Same here. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d15b3769-ba84-4b80-9a2b-b0ce63aa173a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
