But, to be honest, it sounds like a whole lot of technical jargon to me.<p class=message>I can understand why you might think that. But it's actually pretty interesting if you break it down.<p class="message sent">Alright, give me the basics then.<p class=message>Well, there are basically 14 categories of controls, ranging from access control to business continuity management.<p class="message sent">That's a lot of categories! Can you give me an example of each one?<p class=message>Sure. Access control is all about making sure only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data. Asset management is all about keeping track of hardware and software. Cryptography ensures that data is protected through encryption.<p class="message sent">Okay, that makes sense. What about technical measures?<p class=message>In terms of technical measures, there are three different levels - preventive, detective, and corrective. So, for example, firewalls would fall under preventive measures.<p class="message sent">Got it. It's starting to come together for me now.<p class=message>And within each of those categories, there are specific controls that can be put in place to ensure data privacy and security.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a lot to keep track of.<p class=message>It can be overwhelming, but it's important to ensure that data protection and privacy are taken seriously in any organization.<p class="message sent">You're right. I'm definitely going to look more into this.<p class=message>Great! Let me know if you have any other questions.<p class="message sent">Will do.
