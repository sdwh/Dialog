How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm good, just a little tired from all the driving. But I'm excited to make this delivery of hot dim sum!<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, we have a lot of customers waiting for these. Thanks for bringing them over.<p class=message>No problem at all. Do you have any recommendations for me to try next time I come to the restaurant?<p class="message sent">Definitely try our special fried rice, it's one of our most popular dishes. And our spicy tofu is a personal favorite of mine.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! I'll have to come back and try those out. Have you ever tried the dim sum while you work?<p class="message sent">Of course! It's hard to resist the smell of fresh dumplings. I have to admit, I've snuck a few bites while serving customers.<p class=message>Haha, that's great. I can't blame you though, this food is too good to resist.<p class="message sent">Have you ever had any wild experiences while making deliveries?<p class=message>Well, one time I accidentally delivered a pizza to the wrong house and ended up having dinner with a family I didn't know!<p class="message sent">That's hilarious! Did they at least offer you some of their food?<p class=message>They did, and it was actually pretty good. It definitely made up for my mistake.<p class="message sent">Well, hopefully you won't have any more accidental dinner invites in the future. But feel free to stop by the restaurant anytime for some good food!<p class=message>Thank you, I definitely will. Have a great day and enjoy the dim sum!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cf7ceaa3-7096-4af2-9197-98b75bc8ed36.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
