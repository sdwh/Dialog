How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hello! I'm looking for a gift for my niece's birthday, she's turning 5.<p class=message>Oh, how lovely! We have a great selection of toys for that age, any preferences?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I was thinking of something educational, any options?<p class=message>Absolutely! We have some great STEM toys that are both fun and educational. Have you heard of the coding caterpillar?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What is it?<p class=message>It's a toy caterpillar that kids can code to move in different directions, teaching them the basics of coding while they play.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! Do you have it in stock?<p class=message>Yes, we actually just got a fresh batch in this morning. Would you like me to show you where they are?<p class="message sent">Yes, please!<p class=message>Great, this way. And if you have any other questions, just let me know.<p class="message sent">Thanks a lot, you've been really helpful.<p class=message>My pleasure. And just a heads up, we have a promotion going on this week - buy one STEM toy and get one at 50% off. Would you like to take advantage of that?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's great! Yes, I'll browse and see if there's anything else I want to get.<p class=message>Perfect, feel free to take your time. And happy shopping!<p class="message sent">Thank you, I will!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b488c1a-6761-4483-9ca8-c85c67ec9db4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
