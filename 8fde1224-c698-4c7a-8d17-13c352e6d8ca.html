How long have you been a cabbie here in Seoul?<p class="message sent">Hello there, A. I've been driving a taxi for over 10 years in this city. What brings you to Seoul today?<p class=message>Well, I'm here for a business trip. I'm attending a conference at COEX Convention Center.<p class="message sent">COEX? That's one of my favorite places to pick up passengers. It's always busy and vibrant there. Do you have time to explore the city during your stay?<p class=message>Yes, I hope to do some sightseeing if I can. What do you recommend I see, driver B?<p class="message sent">You should definitely check out Namsan Tower for a great view of the city. Bukchon Hanok Village is also a beautiful place to explore. And of course, the food here in Seoul is amazing.<p class=message>That sounds wonderful. I love Korean food! By the way, how's the traffic today?<p class="message sent">It's not too bad at the moment. But it can get pretty heavy during rush hour. But don't worry, I know all the shortcuts.<p class=message>That's great to know. I heard that Korean drivers are very skilled. Is that true?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, we take our driving very seriously here in Korea. And as a taxi driver, I have to make sure I'm always on top of my game.<p class=message>Well, you're doing a great job so far. What's your favorite thing about being a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I love meeting different people every day and hearing their stories. And it's always a great feeling when I can help someone get to their destination quickly and safely.<p class=message>That's really nice to hear, driver B. Hey, do you have any favorite Korean music you recommend I check out?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love K-Pop! You should listen to BTS - they're one of Korea's hottest boy bands right now.<p class=message>Oh wow, I'll definitely give them a listen. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. We're almost at your destination. I hope you have a great time in Seoul.<p class=message>Thank you, driver B. It was great speaking with you. Take care!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8fda5b74-ba93-4cea-8a5b-f9ff39897e6d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
