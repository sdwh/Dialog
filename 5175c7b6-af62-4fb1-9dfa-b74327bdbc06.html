It's all about keeping information secure, right?<p class=message>Exactly! And did you know that it's not just for big corporations anymore?<p class="message sent">Really? Tell me more.<p class=message>Well, even small businesses and startups can benefit from implementing ISO 27001. It's like insurance for your data.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. But doesn't it sound like a lot of work?<p class=message>It can be, but it's definitely worth it. Plus, you get to learn a lot about your own data security and risk management.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I can see the benefits. But I'm still not convinced it's fun.<p class=message>Well, think of it this way: ISO 27001 is like a puzzle that needs solving. And who doesn't love a good puzzle?<p class="message sent">Okay, you have a point there. So, have you implemented it in your company?<p class=message>Yes! And you know what's even more fun? Outsmarting hackers and keeping our data safe.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a challenge I'm willing to take on. Maybe I should look into it too.<p class=message>Absolutely! Just remember to have fun with it, and you'll be ISO certified in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=51727e42-5a32-4222-be20-99e4185068a2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
