What movie are we watching tonight?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! We're watching a comedy called "The Hangover."<p class=message>Oh, I've heard about that one. It's supposed to be really funny.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. I hope you're in the mood to laugh.<p class=message>Absolutely! I could use a good laugh. So, how did you come across this movie?<p class="message sent">I saw it a few years ago and thought it was hilarious. I figured it would be a great choice for tonight's movie.<p class=message>That's a good enough endorsement for me. Hey, speaking of movies, have you ever acted in a comedy before?<p class="message sent">Oh, no. I don't think I'd be very good at it. I prefer making dramas.<p class=message>I can see that. You do have a talent for emotional scenes. But, you should give comedy a try. It's really fun.<p class="message sent">Maybe I will one of these days. But for now, I'd rather stick to directing.<p class=message>Fair enough. Hey, do you think they sell popcorn here? I'm craving some.<p class="message sent">Of course they do. And, get this â€“ they have a special flavor called "jalapeno cheddar." You should try it.<p class=message>Sounds spicy! I'll give it a taste. Let's go get some before the movie starts.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c86c10ea-cf4d-4208-9d82-9893a2f40e75.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
