We ran around, played on the swings, and even had a picnic.<p class=message>That sounds like so much fun! What did you have for your picnic?<p class="message sent">My mom made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and we had some fruit and juice boxes.<p class=message>Yum, that's one of my favorite lunch options. Did you see any other kids at the park while you were playing?<p class="message sent">Yeah, there were some other kids there too. I made a new friend and we played tag together.<p class=message>That's great! Having friends to play with at the park makes it even more fun. Did your mom join in on any of the games?<p class="message sent">She did, actually. We played hide and seek and my mom was really good at finding all of our hiding spots.<p class=message>Wow, your mom sounds like a lot of fun. I hope I can play at the park with you and your mom sometime.<p class="message sent">That would be great! We can have a big picnic and play all day long.<p class=message>That sounds like the perfect day to me. Thanks for telling me all about your fun adventure at the park, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, anytime!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=44f1c3db-7f92-4116-b1f4-f0058ed4e4eb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
