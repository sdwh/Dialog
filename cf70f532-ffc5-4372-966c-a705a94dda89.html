Have you ever had a pet before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have a dog. He's the cutest thing ever!<p class=message>What breed is he?<p class="message sent">He's a little mutt. I adopted him from the shelter a while back.<p class=message>That's so cool. I've always wanted a pet but my apartment doesn't allow them.<p class="message sent">You should get a fish! They're pretty low maintenance.<p class=message>Yeah, that's true. But don't they just swim around all day?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but they're still fun to watch. Plus, you can get some really pretty ones.<p class=message>I've also heard of people having pet snakes. Would you ever consider getting one?<p class="message sent">Not really my thing. They kind of freak me out.<p class=message>Yeah, I can see how they would. What about birds? They can be really cute and talkative.<p class="message sent">My aunt has a parrot that never stops talking. It's cute at first, but gets pretty annoying after a while.<p class=message>Haha, I can imagine. Maybe I'll just stick with admiring other people's pets for now.<p class="message sent">That's always an option. Or you could volunteer at an animal shelter and get your pet fix that way.<p class=message>That's a great idea! I'll have to look into that.<p class="message sent">Definitely do. The animals would love the attention and you'll get some good karma points.<p class=message>Haha, for sure. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class="message sent">Anytime. Let me know if you end up volunteering somewhere. I might have to join you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cf6c79a7-41ef-4070-af44-f52a9c0a9e93.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
