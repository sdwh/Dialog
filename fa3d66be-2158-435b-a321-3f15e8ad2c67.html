What's your name?<p class=message>I'm A and I'm a street performer. I can juggle balls and knives, do magic tricks, and even dance.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing. How long have you been performing on the streets?<p class=message>It's been almost 5 years now. I love the freedom and creativity it gives me.<p class="message sent">I bet it's a lot of hard work too. Do you make a living from performing on the streets?<p class=message>Yeah, I do. I get paid through tips and sometimes people even hire me for events and parties.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. Can you show me one of your tricks?<p class=message>Sure thing. Here, hold this ball while I juggle these three knives.<p class="message sent">Wow, this is incredible. I can't believe you're doing this on the streets.<p class=message>Thanks for the compliment. I take pride in what I do best.<p class="message sent">Do you have any future plans to perform anywhere else beside the streets?<p class=message>Yes, I'm planning to perform around the world someday. I want to showcase my talent to a bigger audience.<p class="message sent">I hope you get there soon. It would be amazing to see you perform on a bigger stage.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate your support. Do you want to give it a try?<p class="message sent">Me? No, I don't think I can do it. It takes a lot of practice to be as good as you.<p class=message>(Laughs) Well, I'll be here if you ever change your mind. Thanks for stopping by and watching my show.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. It was a pleasure to watch you perform.
