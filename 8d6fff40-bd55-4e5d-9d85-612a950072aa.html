How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, Dr. A. I've been feeling pretty stressed lately, and I'm not sure what to do about it.<p class=message>Sure thing, B. Can you tell me more about what's been causing your stress?<p class="message sent">Well, I have a few exams coming up, and I'm worried about doing well on them. Plus, I've been having trouble sleeping lately.<p class=message>Okay, those are common concerns. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or exercise to help manage your stress?<p class="message sent">Not really. I've just been trying to study as much as possible, but it seems like it's not helping.<p class=message>I understand. It's important to take care of yourself during times of stress. Maybe try some yoga or meditation to help calm your mind.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. Do you know of any good yoga classes around here?<p class=message>Actually, there's a great studio just down the street. I can give you their information if you'd like.<p class="message sent">That would be awesome, thanks!<p class=message>Of course. And also, make sure you're getting enough sleep and taking breaks when you need them. It's okay to take a step back and relax sometimes.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Dr. A. I feel a lot better after talking with you.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. And remember, if you ever need additional support, we're always here to help.<p class="message sent">I appreciate that. Thanks again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8d6cb541-e45a-40f0-8381-a4710f3e920a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
