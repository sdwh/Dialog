I'm glad to have you here. Would you like to take a look at our dessert menu?<p class=message>Yes, please. I'm interested in seeing your best-sellers and your most creative dishes.<p class="message sent">Our best-sellers are the chocolate cake and the tiramisu.

How do you plate your desserts?<p class="message sent">We have different presentation styles depending on the dessert.
