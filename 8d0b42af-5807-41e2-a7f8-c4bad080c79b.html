And you are the cleaning staff, I presume?<p class=message>Yes, that's me. My name is David.<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you, David. So, how is everything in regards to cleanliness around here?<p class=message>It's okay, I try my best to keep the place tidy. But some customers can be messy.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I can imagine. Speaking of which, what do you think about placing more trash cans around the store?<p class=message>That's a good idea, I've noticed that some people tend to litter when they can't find a trash bin nearby.<p class="message sent">I agree. I also think it might be helpful to put up some signs reminding people to dispose of their trash properly.<p class=message>Definitely. And maybe we could also use more hand sanitizer stations around the store.<p class="message sent">Yes, especially with the current situation. We want to keep our customers and employees safe and healthy.<p class=message>Absolutely. And speaking of health, the ventilation in the storeroom could be improved. It gets stuffy in there sometimes.<p class="message sent">I see. I'll make a note of that and check out the ventilation system. Thank you for bringing that to my attention.<p class=message>No problem at all. And if you need any help, I'm always here to lend a hand.<p class="message sent">That's very kind of you, David. It's great to have a dedicated and responsible team member like you on board.<p class=message>Thank you, I appreciate that. It's always nice to work for a company that cares about their employees and customers.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It takes teamwork to create a welcoming and clean environment for everyone.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8d071d47-7d38-4a68-b1b3-7602652aba00.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
