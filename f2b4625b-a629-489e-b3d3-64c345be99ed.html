What are you working on?<p class="message sent">Hey there! I've been trying to fix some bugs that we discovered during code review. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. I've been working on some source code analysis to see if we can catch anything before it causes any issues down the line.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. What tool are you using for source code analysis?<p class=message>I'm mainly using SonarQube at the moment. It's been helpful in detecting potential vulnerabilities and code smells.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've used SonarQube before too. It's pretty comprehensive. Have you come across anything interesting?<p class=message>Actually, yes! There was one instance where our code had a security flaw that we hadn't noticed before.<p class="message sent">Oh no, that's not good. Did you manage to fix it?<p class=message>Yeah, we were able to patch it up pretty quickly. That's the advantage of using source code analysis tools like this.<p class="message sent">That's true. It definitely helps to catch things before they become bigger problems for us or our users.<p class=message>Have you found anything light-hearted in your code review?<p class="message sent">Well, there was one amusing comment left in the code. Someone had put in "TODO: fix this ugly hack later" and it's been sitting there for years.<p class=message>Haha, that's classic. Maybe we should go ahead and fix that now.<p class="message sent">Yeah, maybe it's time to take care of those small things that we've been procrastinating on.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f2b3c6de-578d-4f6d-bf35-20eb97b3e9f0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
