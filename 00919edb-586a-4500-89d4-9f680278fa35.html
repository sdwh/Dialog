Today, we have a special guest with us, a software engineer who will help us learn more about the latest ASP.NET Core technology. Welcome B!<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, A. It's great to be here.<p class=message>So, tell us a little bit about ASP.NET Core. What makes it different from other technologies?<p class="message sent">Well, ASP.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform framework that allows developers to build web applications using .NET. It's a great choice for those who want to build scalable and high-performance web applications.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. Can you give us an example of how this technology can be used?<p class="message sent">Sure! ASP.NET Core can be used to build web applications, APIs, and microservices. It's a powerful tool for creating web applications that can run on multiple platforms.<p class=message>That's amazing. Can you give us an idea of how to get started with ASP.NET core?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. You can start by downloading and installing the .NET Core SDK. After that, you can create a new ASP.NET Core project using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other text editor.<p class=message>This seems like a great option for developers. How is the community response to ASP.NET Core?<p class="message sent">The community has been very positive about this technology. ASP.NET Core is one of the fastest-growing frameworks in the .NET ecosystem, and it's being used by companies like Microsoft, Google, and Netflix.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. I'm sure our listeners would love to learn more about this technology. Where can they go to learn more?<p class="message sent">They can visit the .NET website or join the Microsoft Developer Network to learn more about ASP.NET Core. There are also many online resources like documentation, forums, and video tutorials available to help them get started.<p class=message>That's great. Thank you so much for joining us today, B, and sharing your knowledge about ASP.NET Core. It was great to have you on our show.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, A.
