Can you provide your account number, please?<p class=message>Sure, it's 123456789.<p class="message sent">Okay, thank you. What type of mileage are you referring to? Is it frequent flyer miles or credit card rewards points?<p class=message>It's for frequent flyer miles, specifically for my last flight to London.<p class="message sent">Got it. Can you tell me the date of your flight and your departure and arrival airports?<p class=message>Yes, it was on June 1 and I flew from New York to London Heathrow.<p class="message sent">Great, let me just check our records. (pause) Ah, here it is. It looks like 5,500 miles were added to your account for that flight.<p class=message>Perfect, that sounds about right. Thanks for your help!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?<p class=message>Actually, yes. I was wondering if there are any promotions or deals for future flights to Australia?<p class="message sent">Let me take a look for you. (pause) Unfortunately, we don't have any current promotions for Australia. However, we do offer a rewards program that can help you earn points towards future flights. Would you like more information about that?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds great.<p class="message sent">Okay, I can send you some information by email. What email address can I send it to?<p class=message>It's john.smith@email.com.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll send that over now.
