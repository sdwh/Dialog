Let's start our class with a smile on our face! My name is Anna and I'm your yoga teacher today. What's your name?<p class="message sent">Hi Anna, I'm Chloe. I'm excited to learn yoga.<p class=message>Great Chloe, good to have you here. Just to start, let's do some deep breathing exercises. Inhale slowly and exhale slowly. Let your worries disappear.<p class="message sent">(breathes deeply) This is relaxing.<p class=message>Yes, it is. Now, let's move on to some poses. Can you do a downward dog?<p class="message sent">(tries to do it) I think I'm doing it wrong.<p class=message>Don't worry, just keep trying. Everyone has to start somewhere. Besides, nobody is perfect in yoga.<p class="message sent">Okay, let me give it another go. (tries again)<p class=message>That's it, you're getting the hang of it! You've got a great potential. Keep it up!<p class="message sent">Thank you, Anna! You're such an encouraging teacher.<p class=message>No problem at all. Let's do some warrior poses to get those muscles working. Are you prepared for this?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm ready!<p class=message>Great attitude! Now, extend your arms and let's begin by taking a big step forward. Keep your core muscles tight.<p class="message sent">(trying to keep balance) This is challenging.<p class=message>Yes, it is. But don't forget that yoga is all about challenging yourself. You can do this!<p class="message sent">(finally gets the pose right) Wow, I did it! Thanks, Anna. You're an amazing teacher.<p class=message>It’s my pleasure, Chloe. You’re a fast learner. Keep practicing, I’m sure you can do much better in the future classes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9b8cafc8-374f-4cb0-a49e-d33ce87b4561.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
