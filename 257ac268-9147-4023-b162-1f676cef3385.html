I noticed we have a surplus of stamps in the supply room. Do you have any ideas on what we can do with them?<p class="message sent">Hi A. Yes, I was thinking we could maybe host an office-wide "stamp art" contest. Employees can use the stamps to create unique works of art and the best ones can be displayed in the office.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea, B! We could use social media to promote it and encourage employees to get creative.<p class="message sent">Definitely! We could also donate some of the stamps to local schools or art programs. They might appreciate the extra supplies.<p class=message>I like that idea too. Maybe we can reach out to them and see if they are interested in receiving them.<p class="message sent">Another option could be to use the stamps to create personalized company thank you notes. It adds a personal touch and reduces our spending on other office supplies.<p class=message>I like that idea as well, B. We can have employees create their own personal thank you notes and we can even have a stamp featuring our company logo to add a professional touch.<p class="message sent">Exactly! It's a win-win situation. Plus, we can always use the leftover stamps for handling mail and other office tasks.<p class=message>Great thinking, B. Let's get started on implementing these ideas as soon as possible.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A. I'll start putting together a proposal and gathering information about local organizations that may be interested in the donated stamps.<p class=message>Perfect. And I'll see if we can get some art supplies for the stamp art contest. This will be a fun way to engage everyone in the office and make good use of our resources.<p class="message sent">Sounds fantastic, A. I'm excited to see the creative ideas that come from this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=25778864-fe11-41f1-951a-046c9af2ea97.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
