Seems like we're going to need a lot of computing power for this one.<p class=message>Yeah, it's definitely pretty advanced. But I'm sure we can handle it. What kind of tools do you think we should use for the development?<p class="message sent">Well, I think we should definitely use Kubernetes for container orchestration. That should help us scale the application quickly.<p class=message>Good idea. And we could use Ansible for automation, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And if we use Jenkins for continuous integration, we can make sure that everything is running smoothly.<p class=message>Yeah, we definitely need to have a good development process in place for this one. But what about testing?<p class="message sent">I was thinking we could use Selenium for automated web testing. And for load testing, we could use JMeter.<p class=message>Sounds like a solid plan. What about deployment?<p class="message sent">We could use Helm for package management and deployment to the cluster. And for monitoring, we've got Prometheus and Grafana.<p class=message>Awesome. You really know your stuff, B.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I think we're going to make an awesome team for this project.<p class=message>Absolutely. With our combined expertise, we'll be sure to get this project off the ground in no time!<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7a3116cc-abba-4753-94ed-49a91952dce1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
