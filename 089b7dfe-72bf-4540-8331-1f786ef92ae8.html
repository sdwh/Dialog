So, what have you been working on lately?<p class="message sent">I've been working on a new landing page design for one of our clients. It's looking pretty sharp if I do say so myself!<p class=message>Nice! I'm sure the client will be happy with it. Anything you need help with on that project?<p class="message sent">Actually, now that you mention it, I could use some help with the copy for the page. Would you be willing to take a look at it and offer some suggestions?<p class=message>Sure thing, happy to help. What's the main goal of the page?<p class="message sent">The main goal is to get users to sign up for a free trial of the client's software.<p class=message>Got it, I'll take a look and see what I can do. By the way, did you see the game last night?<p class="message sent">No, I missed it. Who won?<p class=message>The home team actually won in overtime. It was a nail-biter!<p class="message sent">Oh man, I wish I could have watched it. I'm a huge fan of the home team.<p class=message>Me too! We definitely need to catch a game together sometime.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. How about we make that the plan for our next team outing?<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. Speaking of outings, have you given any thought to the upcoming company retreat?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been brainstorming some ideas for team-building activities. Maybe we could do a scavenger hunt or a group cooking challenge.<p class=message>Those both sound like fun options. I think the team would really enjoy that.<p class="message sent">I hope so! I'm looking forward to it. Alright, I think that's enough for the stand up today. Thanks for your help with the copy, A.<p class=message>No problem, always happy to help out. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0898787a-9b86-4b76-9eb5-032cf2324d97.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
