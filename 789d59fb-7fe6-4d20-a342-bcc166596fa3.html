Our flight got postponed twice!<p class=message>Oh no, that's terrible! Did they give you any reason for the delay?<p class="message sent">They said there was bad weather conditions, I guess we can't do anything about it.<p class=message>Yeah, it's always unpredictable. Did you manage to pass the time somehow?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we grabbed some food and watched movies. It wasn't all that bad.<p class=message>That's a good idea. I wish I had packed a book or something.<p class="message sent">Well, now you know for next time! Did you have any delays on your previous flights?<p class=message>Yeah, I once had a layover that lasted all day. It was the worst!<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like a nightmare. Did you get any compensation or vouchers for that?<p class=message>Actually, I did. The airline gave me a free night at a hotel and some meal vouchers.<p class="message sent">That's not bad at all. I hope I get some compensation for this delay too.<p class=message>Fingers crossed! Have you ever had a flight cancelled altogether?<p class="message sent">Yes, once when I was traveling to Tokyo. I had to stay at a hotel for two nights because all the flights were booked.<p class=message>Oh no, that's frustrating. Did you eventually make it to your destination?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but it was two days later than planned. At least I got to see more of Tokyo!<p class=message>That's a good way to think about it. I hope our flight doesn't get cancelled, I can't afford to stay in a hotel for two nights!<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah let's hope not. But if it does, I'll be sure to bring a deck of cards next time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7896e0d2-1ca8-4fce-bf69-470bed00f9d8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
