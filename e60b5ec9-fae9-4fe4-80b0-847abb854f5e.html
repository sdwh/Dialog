How about you?<p class=message>Same here, it's a busy day in the kitchen. What's on your delivery list today?<p class="message sent">Let's see... I have some fresh seafood for the steakhouse down the street, a variety of cheeses for the Italian restaurant, and a few crates of avocados for the Mexican joint.<p class=message>Sounds like a tasty lineup. I'm over here whipping up some barbeque pork ribs, mac and cheese, and cornbread muffins. What's your favorite type of cuisine to deliver?<p class="message sent">Definitely sushi. I love the way it's presented and it always smells amazing.<p class=message>I know what you mean. I'm a big fan of Thai food, myself. Have you ever tried the pad Thai from that one restaurant on Main Street?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, they make a killer pad Thai. And their green curry is out of this world.<p class=message>You're making me hungry just thinking about it. Hey, have you heard about that new food truck that's been parked by the park lately?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I heard they're serving up some really unique dishes. I might have to check it out on my lunch break.<p class=message>Same here. It's always fun trying something new. Speaking of which, have you ever had durian fruit?<p class="message sent">Can't say that I have. Why do you ask?<p class=message>I tried it for the first time last week and it was... let's just say interesting.<p class="message sent">Interesting how?<p class=message>It has a very strong smell and unique taste. Some people love it, others not so much. You should try it sometime and see for yourself.<p class="message sent">I just might have to take you up on that challenge. Well, I better get back to my deliveries. See you around, A.<p class=message>Take care, B. Keep spreading those delicious meals all over town.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e60a4044-c127-4cd3-8573-ce21ee15179c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
