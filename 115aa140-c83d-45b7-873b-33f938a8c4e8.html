You've got quite the variety of fresh fruits here. How's business been lately?<p class="message sent">Thanks! Business has been good. I try to offer the freshest fruits available in the market to attract customers.<p class=message>I can tell by the quality of your fruits that you take pride in your work. Do you have any tips for selling fruits?<p class="message sent">Well, it's important to display the fruits in an attractive way. I like to use colorful baskets and arrange them neatly on my stand. I also give customers a sample to try before they buy.<p class=message>That's a great idea! I may implement that in my own stand. I have a question, what kinds of fruits sell the best in this area?<p class="message sent">In my experience, apples and oranges are always popular. But it's also important to offer unusual fruits that people may not have tried before. It adds an element of excitement to their shopping experience.<p class=message>You're right. I'll try offering something different like dragon fruits and pomegranates. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class="message sent">No problem. We need to constantly innovate to keep customers interested. Speaking of which, have you heard of the newest hybrid fruit that's making waves in the market?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What is it?<p class="message sent">It's called the pluot! It's a cross between a plum and an apricot. It's sweet and tangy at the same time. You should try growing it on your farm.<p class=message>Wow, I've never heard of that one. I'm definitely curious. Maybe I'll try growing some. Thank you for telling me about it!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. We need to support each other in this business. That's what makes the market thrive!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1156ccc9-9423-40e8-b5ed-bdd6aaacf54a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
