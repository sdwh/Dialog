How's your day going?<p class="message sent">Pretty good, A! Just got done serving a table of people who were raving about our enchiladas.<p class=message>That's great to hear! We do make some pretty amazing enchiladas.<p class="message sent">Definitely. So, what do we have on the agenda for today?<p class=message>Well, first we need to restock the kitchen with some fresh ingredients. Then, I want to try out a new recipe for our salsa verde.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious. Do you need me to help with anything in particular?<p class=message>Actually, I was hoping you could take care of refilling the salsa bowls on the tables. And maybe check in on our customers and see how they're enjoying their meals.<p class="message sent">No problem, boss. So, have you heard about the new Mexican restaurant downtown?<p class=message>I have! I heard they have a great selection of tequilas.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I was thinking of checking it out this weekend. Maybe we could have a work outing there?<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can make a reservation and get the whole staff involved.<p class="message sent">Perfect. I think it would be a great opportunity for team bonding.<p class=message>Agreed. And while we're on the topic, I just want to say how happy I am with the work you've been doing lately. You've really stepped up your game.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A! That means a lot to me. I've been trying my best to make this place the best it can be.<p class=message>And you're doing a fantastic job. Keep up the good work.<p class="message sent">Thanks, boss. I appreciate it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8d05cbe1-0f28-4082-abef-f9e687eaa4a7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
