It's been a bit of a headache.<p class=message>Oh, I feel your pain. Licensing can certainly be confusing. Have you considered using the cloud?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we have actually. But our team has some reservations about data security.<p class=message>I hear you. But cloud providers like Microsoft have a lot of security measures in place. Plus, you can save some money on licensing costs.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a good point. I'll bring it up with the team. How about you? Have you dealt with licensing before?<p class=message>Oh yeah, plenty of times. It's always a bit of a puzzle to figure out the right solution.<p class="message sent">Tell me about it. I feel like I need a law degree just to understand some of this legal jargon.<p class=message>Hahaha, I know what you mean. The Microsoft licensing agreements can be quite dense. But there are plenty of resources available to help understand it.<p class="message sent">That's true. I've been reading through some articles and watching a few videos, so hopefully I'll get a better handle on it soon.<p class=message>I'm sure you will. And feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate that. You've been really helpful!<p class=message>No problem at all. It's always good to help a fellow IT professional out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=417d638e-08f6-4bff-be06-949b316c713c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
