Do you know the best place for breakfast in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Good morning, sir! There are lots of great places for breakfast, what type of food do you like?<p class=message>Hmm, how about something traditional like tamagoyaki or miso soup?<p class="message sent">Ah, I know the perfect place for that! It's a small restaurant called "Nihon-ichi" which is a short distance from here.<p class=message>Great, I'm looking forward to it! By the way, have you seen any good movies recently?<p class="message sent">Actually, I saw "Parasite" last week and it was really amazing! Have you seen it?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It was definitely one of the best movies I have seen in a while.<p class="message sent">I totally agree! I felt like the movie blended humor, suspense, and drama really well.<p class=message>Absolutely! The plot was so unique and kept me on the edge of my seat.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more, sir. It was also really impressive that the movie was from South Korea!<p class=message>Yes, it's really great to see filmmakers from other countries getting recognition for their work.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Oh look, we're almost at the restaurant. I hope you enjoy your breakfast, sir.<p class=message>Thank you so much for the recommendation! I'll definitely check it out.<p class="message sent">No problem, sir.
