I'm a reporter from the Daily News, and I'm here to ask you a few questions about your recent success in the world of dog shows. Would you mind if I ask you some questions?<p class="message sent">Oh, not at all. I'm always happy to talk about my furry friends.<p class=message>Great! So tell me, how did you first get interested in dog shows?<p class="message sent">Well, I've always been a dog lover, and I started attending some events just for fun. But after seeing the bond between the dog and their handler, I became intrigued.<p class=message>That's interesting. What kind of dogs do you typically work with?<p class="message sent">I mostly work with Golden Retrievers. They're great companions and have an easy-going temperament.<p class=message>I can see that. But what sets your dogs apart from other competitors?<p class="message sent">Well, besides their good looks and obedience skills, my dogs are trained to give high-fives and blow kisses to the judges. It always gets a good chuckle from the crowd.<p class=message>That's quite an entertaining tactic! So, what do you have planned next for your furry friends?<p class="message sent">We're planning to take a break from competitions for a bit and focus on therapy dog training. It's a very rewarding experience to see how much joy our dogs can bring to people.<p class=message>That's wonderful to hear. Thank you for your time and for sharing your story with us.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me. It was great to chat with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1638130d-662a-4df9-ae01-5edb36c67f5f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
