I'm the lead auditor for our ISO 27001 compliance audit. I'm excited to work with you, B, as our resident network engineer.<p class="message sent">Hi, A! Thanks for having me on board. I'm looking forward to it as well.<p class=message>Great! Let's start with my favorite question to kick things off: do you have a favorite meme or internet trend right now?<p class="message sent">Haha, that's a great way to start! I really like the one where people place cats and dogs in boxes labeled “If I fits, I sits”. What about you, A?<p class=message>Mine has to be the “Woman yelling at a cat” meme. It gets me every time!<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I think I’ve seen that one too!<p class=message>Alright, we better get back to business. Can you tell me about how you ensure network security on a daily basis?<p class="message sent">Sure! One of the things I do is keep the software and firmware up-to-date on all of our network devices. I also regularly monitor network traffic for any anomalies or suspicious activity.<p class=message>That’s great to hear. During the audit, we’ll need to review documentation related to your network security measures. Can you get that ready for me?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I’ll have it all organized and ready for you by the end of the day.<p class=message>Fantastic. During the audit, we’ll also be looking at physical security measures. Have you had any experiences with “tailgaters” in your office?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, we’ve had a few of those. I always make sure to ask for proper identification and confirm that the visitor is authorized before letting them in.<p class=message>That’s top-notch security awareness. One last thing, do you have any music recommendations for the audit prep?<p class="message sent">I’ve been listening to lo-fi hip hop playlists on Spotify. They’re great for keeping me focused and productive. What about you, A?<p class=message>I usually go for classical music to keep me calm and centered. But I might have to give that lo-fi hip hop a try! Thanks, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3c1b71f6-876c-425e-9107-23909fc55be2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
