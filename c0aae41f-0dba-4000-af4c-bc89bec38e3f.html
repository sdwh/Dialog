You look busy. What are you up to?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, it's a busy day today. We've got a lot of fresh seafood coming in.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! I'm a fisherman and I was wondering if you'd be interested in buying some of my catch.<p class="message sent">Of course! Fresh catch is always welcome. What did you bring in today?<p class=message>I caught some cod, flounder, and a few lobsters.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. I'll definitely take some of that off your hands. How much are you asking for it?<p class=message>As a fellow seafood lover, I'll give you a good deal. How about $10 per pound for the cod and flounder, and $30 for each lobster?<p class="message sent">That sounds fair to me. How fresh is it?<p class=message>I caught these this morning, so it couldn't be fresher!<p class="message sent">Excellent! I'll take all of it then. I'll prepare some special dishes with your catch as a special menu for the day. Do you want to come by later for a meal?<p class=message>That would be fantastic! I brought with me a jar of my homemade tartar sauce to go with the fish. You might want to give it a try.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I love trying new things. Thanks for thinking of me.<p class=message>You're welcome! I'm happy to have found a good home for my catch.<p class="message sent">And I'm happy to have access to freshly caught seafood. It's always a pleasure to serve my customers quality food.<p class=message>It's great to see that we can support each other in this way. I'm sure we'll work together again in the future.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's always good to have a reliable supply of fresh seafood.<p class=message>Well, it's been nice chatting with you. I'll drop off the seafood at your kitchen later this afternoon.<p class="message sent">Fantastic! See you then. Enjoy your day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c0a22ef2-7af4-4f10-880a-685c88858eb4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
