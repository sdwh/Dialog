How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks for asking. So, let's talk about how we can combine software development with IT operations.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a really interesting topic. One thing we can do is use DevOps practices to automate some tasks within IT operations.<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea. What other practices can we use?<p class="message sent">We can also use continuous delivery and continuous deployment to make sure that any changes we make to the software can be immediately deployed to the production environment.<p class=message>That's smart, but wouldn't that add additional risk to the process?<p class="message sent">That's why we need to also implement testing and monitoring throughout the process to ensure that any potential issues can be caught and resolved as quickly as possible.<p class=message>Ah, I see. So, how would you go about implementing these practices into our current workflow?<p class="message sent">It would require coordination between the development and operations teams, as well as an emphasis on communication and collaboration.<p class=message>Got it. Well, this has been a really informative conversation. Thanks for your insights, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=70027351-a782-4073-82de-8ed8a26c9ecf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
