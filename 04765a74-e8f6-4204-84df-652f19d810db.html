Fresh baguettes and croissants just out of the oven! Would you like to try some?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Yes, please. They look delicious. Nothing like a fresh pastry with a cup of coffee by the seaside.<p class=message>Absolutely! That's what we're here for. Speaking of coffee, any recommendation from you for a great cup to go along with our bread?<p class="message sent">Well, we have our signature blend that's perfect for any palate. But if you're feeling adventurous, we also have a local roast that has a unique fruity and nutty aroma.<p class=message>Hmm, I think I'll try your signature blend. But I'd love to try the local roast too. Maybe we can do a coffee and bread pairing session?<p class="message sent">That's a fantastic idea! Let's do it! Nothing like exploring delicious flavors by the sea.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. By the way, how did you get into coffee making?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's a long story. But in short, it started as a hobby and then I fell in love with the art, science, and people that make coffee.<p class=message>Sounds fascinating. And what about baking? How did you become a pastry chef?<p class=message>Oh, well, it runs in the family. My grandmother was a baker and taught me everything I know. And now I get to do what I love, baking fresh bread every morning.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. It really shows in the taste and texture of your bread. And the butter croissants are simply divine.<p class=message>Thank you so much, that means a lot coming from a coffee expert like yourself.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. I think our customers are going to love this pairing, and we should definitely do it again soon.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's keep exploring new flavors together, one baguette and coffee at a time.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan to me! Thanks for the delicious bit of France by the sea.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0472aa6d-1da7-446c-9ea9-3e9bdcc80c2a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
