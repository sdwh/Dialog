I'm the backend engineer. What brings you to this meeting?<p class="message sent">Hey, I'm the database manager. I heard that we need to improve our employee data management system.<p class=message>Definitely. We have a lot of information to sort and manage.<p class="message sent">Yes, we also need to organize it in a way that can be easily accessed by multiple departments.<p class=message>That's true, we could use a more efficient database and a scalable architecture.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We should also think about data privacy and security.<p class=message>Good point, we need to make sure that the information is secured and only authorized personnel can access it.<p class="message sent">How about backups and disaster recovery?<p class=message>Those are important as well. We should have regular backups and a plan in case of an emergency.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Have you worked with MongoDB before? I think it could be a good database option for us.<p class=message>Yes, I have experience with MongoDB. It could be a good fit, especially since it's designed for scalability.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Do you have any ideas on how to best handle employee login credentials?<p class=message>We could use a two-factor authentication system to add an extra layer of security.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. What about storing sensitive information like social security numbers?<p class=message>We could encrypt that information and only allow designated personnel to access it.<p class="message sent">Great. And for information like addresses and phone numbers, we could have restricted access based on department.<p class=message>Yes, that's a good approach. We should also have an audit log to track changes and access to the employee data.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We want to make sure that everything is transparent and accounted for.<p class=message>Agreed. This is going to be a lot of work, but I think we can create a great system with our combined skills.<p class="message sent">I'm excited to work on this project with you. Let's make sure we communicate regularly and stay on track.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let's put our heads together and get to work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=54e8b52f-c24f-472c-bc93-247420b6e7db.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
