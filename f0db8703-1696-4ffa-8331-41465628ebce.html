What did you think about it?<p class=message>Honestly, I found it more scary than watching a horror movie!<p class="message sent">Haha, I know what you mean. It's like a list of all the things that could go wrong.<p class=message>Exactly! It makes me want to put on a tin foil hat and hide under my desk.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, A. We'll fix all those vulnerabilities and make our system as safe as Fort Knox.<p class=message>Ah, you're right. We'll show those hackers what they're up against!<p class="message sent">That's the spirit! And who knows, we might even get some fancy award for our security measures.<p class=message>Ooh, that would be nice. We could hang it up next to our "Employee of the Month" certificate.<p class="message sent">Haha, yes! Then we can really impress our clients and show them they can trust us with their data.<p class=message>Plus, we can sleep better at night knowing we've done everything we can to protect our company.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And maybe we can even go out and celebrate our success, once we're done with this report.<p class=message>I like the way you think, B. Nothing like a good night out to forget about all those vulnerabilities!<p class="message sent">But first, let's get to work and fix them. We'll show that ISO report who's boss!<p class=message>Couldn't agree more, B. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f0dad2e7-9a0a-4018-a51a-3d1b2c98a317.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
