It's making my life so much easier.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had a chance to check it out yet. What's it called?<p class=message>It's called Codea. It lets you write and run code right on your iPad.<p class="message sent">That sounds pretty cool. I'll have to give it a try. Do you use it for any specific programming languages?<p class=message>Yeah, I've been using it for Python and Lua mostly. But it supports a bunch of other languages too.<p class="message sent">Awesome, I'll definitely have to give it a shot then. Anything new and interesting in the project we're working on?<p class=message>Actually, I was thinking we should add some Easter eggs in the code. Maybe something that plays a sound when you type a specific command or click a hidden element.<p class="message sent">I love it! That would add some fun to the project. Do you have any ideas for the sound we could use?<p class=message>How about the sound of a chicken clucking?<p class="message sent">Haha, I like it! Let's definitely do that. Anything else we can do to make our coding more enjoyable?<p class=message>Well, I always find that a good cup of coffee helps.<p class="message sent">Agreed! I'll go grab us some from the break room. Anything else you need to make coding even better?<p class=message>Maybe a massage chair and some ambient music, but I don't think we can swing that in the office.<p class="message sent">Ha, I wish! But for now, we'll just have to settle for the coffee and the fun Easter eggs in the code.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan to me, B. Let's keep coding and keep making it fun.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=64255d24-33b0-4ddc-9b5c-59a50f8ed4be.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
