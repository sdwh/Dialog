Can you take me to the airport, please?<p class="message sent">Good morning, ma'am! Sure thing. May I ask which airline you're taking?<p class=message>Oh, I'm taking Philippine Airlines. Have you ever flown with them before?<p class="message sent">Not yet, ma'am. But I heard they serve the best adobo on their flights!<p class=message>Really? I'll have to try that then. By the way, how long have you been driving taxis?<p class="message sent">About 5 years, ma'am. It's a tough job, but I meet interesting people like you every day.<p class=message>Aww, thank you! I also think it's a great way to explore a new city.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. Speaking of which, have you been to Manila before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time. I'm excited to see the city!<p class="message sent">That's good to hear, ma'am. Manila is a bit chaotic, but it has its own charms. Have you tried our street food yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm curious. Is there any you would recommend?<p class="message sent">Definitely! Try the balut, it's a famous Filipino delicacy made from a duck embryo. Don’t knock it ‘til you’ve tried it!<p class=message>Haha, I'll keep that in mind. I'm willing to try anything once.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit, ma'am. Oh, and make sure to visit Intramuros, it's the old walled city and a great place to learn about Manila's history.<p class=message>Thanks for the tip! I'll put that on my list.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, ma'am. We're almost at the airport now. I hope you have a great time in Manila!<p class=message>Thank you, sir. You've been a great driver and tour guide.
