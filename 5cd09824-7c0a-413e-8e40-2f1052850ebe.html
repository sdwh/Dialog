I'm Officer A. Can you please state your name and what you were doing last night?<p class="message sent">Uh, my name is Tom. And, uh, last night I was just, you know, hanging out with some friends.<p class=message>Okay, Tom. We received a report of noise disturbance from your area last night. Did you hear or see anything unusual?<p class="message sent">No, officer, everything was quiet. We were just playing some music and having a good time.<p class=message>I see. Well, we have reports of vandalism in the area last night. Do you have any knowledge or involvement in this?<p class="message sent">No, officer, I don't know anything about that.<p class=message>Alright then. Can you please turn out your pockets for me?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, officer. *emptying out pockets*<p class=message>Is this yours? *holds up a spray paint can*<p class="message sent">*sighs* Yeah, okay, I did spray paint some graffiti on the wall last night.<p class=message>I thought so. Tom, you know that's illegal, right? You're going to have to pay for the damages.<p class="message sent">Yes, officer, I understand.<p class=message>Alright Tom, I'm going to have to take you into custody now. But first, can I ask what made you want to spray paint on the wall?<p class="message sent">*smiling sheepishly* Just some harmless fun, officer. I didn't mean any harm.<p class=message>Well, Tom, I hope you learned your lesson this time. Vandalism is a serious crime, and I'm sure your parents would want you to make better choices.<p class="message sent">Yes, officer, I understand.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ccc0829-af55-46b2-a53e-f59d471f02f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
