How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">Pretty busy, but that's a good thing. We've got a lot of customers today!<p class=message>That's great news. So how's the kitchen doing? Any issues?<p class="message sent">Not at all, everything is running smoothly. The chefs are really on top of their game.<p class=message>Fantastic. I'm really glad to hear that. So, what do you recommend for today's specials?<p class="message sent">Well, the tacos al pastor with pineapple salsa are really popular. And the chile rellenos are always a hit too.<p class=message>Oh, those sound delicious! I'll have to try them out myself later. So, any funny stories from today?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, we had a guy come in wearing a giant sombrero and a fake mustache. He really got into the spirit of things.<p class=message>(laughs) That's awesome! Did he manage to finish all his food?<p class="message sent">Actually, he ordered so much that he had to take a lot of it to go. I think he'll be enjoying our food for the next few days.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, there's worse problems to have than too much delicious food, right? So, how are the customers today? Do you get to chat with them much?<p class="message sent">Some of them are really friendly and love to chat. I had a great conversation with a couple who are visiting from out of town. They were really excited to try authentic Mexican cuisine.<p class=message>That's always nice to hear. We're lucky to have such a great team here, providing amazing food and service. (pauses) Hey, what do you think about having a staff party next month? It'd be a nice chance to relax and celebrate our hard work.<p class="message sent">I'm all for it! Let's plan something fun, maybe a piñata and some margaritas?<p class=message>Yes! I love it. (smiles) Alright, let's get back to work. We've got lots of hungry customers to serve, and some piñata planning to do!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e46f19b0-24ac-4d76-b7f2-c6b9e3b39bfc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
