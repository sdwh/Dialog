I always have to double-check my understanding of the jargon.<p class="message sent">It's like a whole new language, isn't it?<p class=message>Yeah, but you'll get the hang of it soon enough. By the way, did you catch the game last night?<p class="message sent">I did, it was a crazy ending. Can you believe the referee made that call?<p class=message>I know, right? I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Speaking of calls, have you finished reviewing all the compliance issues we identified?<p class="message sent">Almost there, just a few more to go. But you know what, I think we deserve a break soon.<p class=message>Agreed. How about we grab some coffee and catch up on non-work stuff?<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect to me. I could use a caffeine boost to power through the rest of these reports.<p class=message>Great, let's go then. Oh, but first, one more thing - did you hear about that new restaurant that just opened downtown?<p class="message sent">No, what's it called?<p class=message>It's called "The Foodie's Paradise", and apparently, their brunch menu is mind-blowing. We should check it out sometime.<p class="message sent">That sounds awesome, count me in. Alright, let's go grab that coffee before we zone out completely.<p class=message>Lead the way my friend, lead the way.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b70e3522-9e72-45fd-89b0-2ddd2fdb43fd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
