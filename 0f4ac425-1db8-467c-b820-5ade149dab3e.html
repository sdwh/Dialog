Seems pretty straightforward.<p class=message>I agree. But have you noticed anything different from the previous versions?<p class="message sent">Nothing major, just a few updates on the specific requirements and procedures for recovery.<p class=message>Yeah, and I think they emphasized the importance of testing it regularly too.<p class="message sent">Definitely, especially since it's a critical part of the whole security system.<p class=message>I'm just worried that some companies might not take it seriously enough.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's always a risk. But I think it's our job to make sure they understand the implications of not having a proper DRP.<p class=message>Couldn't agree more. So, how do you think we should communicate that to our clients?<p class="message sent">I think we could create a presentation or a video that explains the risks and benefits of having a proper DRP.<p class=message>Good idea. We could also showcase some examples of companies that went through a disaster without a DRP and the consequences they faced.<p class="message sent">That's a great way to get the message across. And we could even offer some tips on how to conduct DRP tests effectively.<p class=message>Yes, and we could also provide resources and support for our clients to develop their own DRP.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's not just about selling a service, but also about ensuring their security and peace of mind.<p class=message>Exactly. And with the new ISO standards, it's becoming more important than ever to have a comprehensive DRP in place.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's get started on that presentation and make a difference in our clients' security practices.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Thanks for the brainstorming session, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always great to work together towards a common goal.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0f47dca8-2a30-4020-beec-96689571a392.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
