It's one of my favorite dishes. Why do you ask?<p class=message>I was just wondering because I had it for the first time last week and I'm obsessed now.<p class="message sent">Oh really? What kind did you have?<p class=message>It was a vegetable stir-fry with tofu and a spicy sauce. It was amazing!<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. I usually go for a chicken stir-fry with lots of veggies and a savory sauce.<p class=message>Yum! I love veggies in my stir-fry too. What's your favorite vegetable to add in?<p class="message sent">Definitely broccoli. It’s so good when it’s all crispy and slightly charred.<p class=message>Agreed! And the great thing about stir-fry is you can really customize it to your own taste. Do you ever add nuts or seeds for crunch?<p class="message sent">Yes! I like to add some peanuts for texture and flavor.<p class=message>That's a good idea. I haven't tried that before. Have you ever made your own stir-fry at home?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's actually pretty easy to make. You just need the right ingredients and a wok.<p class=message>I don't have a wok, but I'll have to invest in one because I would love to make my own stir-fry. Do you have any favorite recipes you follow?<p class="message sent">Not really, I just kind of throw in whatever veggies and protein I have on hand and then make a sauce from soy sauce, garlic, hoisin sauce, and a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it up.<p class=message>That sounds easy enough. I'll have to give it a try. Thanks for the tip!<p class="message sent">No problem. Enjoy your stir-fry adventures!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7135158c-bdea-45c3-99ea-74a4b8fa144f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
