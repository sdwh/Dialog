How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I've been driving taxis for about five years. How about you, have you been to Brisbane before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time. Any places you'd recommend checking out?<p class="message sent">Definitely head down to South Bank for a nice stroll along the river. And the Story Bridge is a must-see. Have you tried Vegemite yet?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it really as salty as people say?<p class="message sent">It can be a bit of an acquired taste, but most Australians love it. I recommend trying it on toast with some butter.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. So, what do you like most about driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">I love meeting new people from all over the world and hearing about their travels. It's always interesting to hear their stories.<p class=message>That's really cool. Do you have any funny stories from your time as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh, I have plenty! Once, a passenger forgot their bag in the back seat and called me in a panic. I returned it to them, and they were so grateful they offered to buy me a drink!<p class=message>Haha, that's a great story. Thanks for being such a friendly driver and for the recommendations.<p class="message sent">No worries, enjoy your trip in Brisbane!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=deef8ce2-4a36-4764-aeb3-51a0d9c8d300.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
