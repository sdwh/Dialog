For about five years now. What brings you to Kaohsiung?<p class=message>Just a short vacation. I want to see the Lotus Pond, Fo Guang Shan Monastery, and try some delicious street food.<p class="message sent">Great choices! I can take you to the best places. Have you tried stinky tofu before?<p class=message>No, not yet. But I'm willing to try anything once.<p class="message sent">You're brave! It's an acquired taste. I can recommend some less smelly options too.<p class=message>Haha, thanks for the warning. So, do you have any hobbies when you're not driving?<p class="message sent">Yes, I enjoy playing basketball and watching movies.<p class=message>Cool, who's your favorite basketball team?<p class="message sent">I used to be a huge fan of the Lakers when Kobe was still playing. How about you?<p class=message>I like the Golden State Warriors. Steph Curry is my favorite player.<p class="message sent">You know, I drove him once to a game in Taipei. He's a really nice guy.<p class=message>Wow, that's amazing. Did you talk to him?<p class="message sent">Just a bit, he was really focused on the game. But he gave me a signed jersey as a token of appreciation.<p class=message>That's so cool. You must have some interesting stories about your job.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I've met all sorts of people and driven to some incredible places. Like the time I drove a famous singer to a concert in Tainan.<p class=message>Who was it?<p class="message sent">I can't say, but let's just say she has a big voice and even bigger hair.<p class=message>Haha, okay, I think I know who you mean. Thanks for the ride and the entertaining conversation.<p class="message sent">No problem, have a great time in Kaohsiung!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e606c674-beed-4bf7-9992-da13dfe05473.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
