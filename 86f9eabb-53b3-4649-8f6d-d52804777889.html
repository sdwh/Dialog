How's everything going today?<p class="message sent">Morning A. It's been a busy morning, but everything is under control. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. We had a lot of orders for breakfast. But, it's always a good thing to have more customers, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! So, what's on our agenda for today?<p class=message>I was thinking we could switch up the menu a bit. Maybe add some new dishes to keep our regular customers interested?<p class="message sent">Great idea! Any suggestions you have in mind?<p class=message>I was thinking of adding a vegan burger and maybe some gluten-free options.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. We definitely need to cater to a wider audience.<p class=message>Oh, by the way, did you hear about the new sushi restaurant that's opening up down the street?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I heard. But, I'm not too worried. We have our own unique style of food and ambiance that they can't replicate.<p class=message>That's very true. Plus, we've built up a loyal customer base over the years.<p class="message sent">Speaking of our customers, did you hear about the review we got on our Facebook page?<p class=message>No, what did it say?<p class="message sent">They said our service was exceptional and they loved the ambiance. They also mentioned your mushroom risotto was the best they've ever tasted!<p class=message>That's awesome! It's always nice to get positive feedback.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. By the way, did you manage to fix the oven that was acting up yesterday?<p class=message>Yes, we were running diagnostic tests all night and we finally found the issue. It should be working fine now.<p class="message sent">Great job, A! I don't know what we would do without you.<p class=message>Aw, thank you! It's always a pleasure working with you, B.<p class="message sent">Same here, A. Let's keep up the good work and make this restaurant even better!<p class=message>Absolutely. *high five*</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=86f9e353-ceae-4b7f-860d-bbd0841bff0d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
