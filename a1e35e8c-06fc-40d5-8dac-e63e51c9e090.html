How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Hey A, morning! It was great, I finally finished reading a novel I've been wanting to read for months. What about you?<p class=message>Same here, I finished a book on programming patterns. Say, do you remember the day we spent struggling with a bug?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, the "Elusive Bug Day". What a nightmare!<p class=message>I found out what the issue was - a simple typo in indentation. Can you believe it?<p class="message sent">That's hilarious! One tiny mistake can cause so much trouble. Did you also see the funny error message I accidentally printed?<p class=message>Yes, it made me chuckle - "The coffee machine is broken, please fix it ASAP". We should have an "Easter egg" category for these types of messages and errors.<p class="message sent">We definitely should! Hey, I wanted to suggest using a new library in our project. It's called "Kittens", and it generates random pictures of cats, to make our error pages and loading screens more enjoyable.<p class=message>Haha, that sounds cute and fun. Let's try it out! By the way, have you seen the new Ruby on Rails updates? We can now use a shortcut for loading the development console.<p class="message sent">Really? That'll save us some time. Oh, and speaking of shortcuts, have you tried using VS Code's "Zen Mode"? It gives a great distraction-free environment for coding.<p class=message>No way, I haven't used it. That's a great tip. I might be more productive with less distractions. Thanks, B!<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. That's what teammates are for!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a1e25474-a55f-4aa1-8742-6e6b1cd58697.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
