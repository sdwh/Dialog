The view of the city from the Main Hall is absolutely incredible.<p class=message>I can see why it's one of Japan's most famous and historic temples. It's hard to believe it's over 1,200 years old!<p class="message sent">That's right. And did you know that the Main Hall was built without any nails?<p class=message>Really? That's impressive! How did they manage that?<p class="message sent">The secret is in the interlocking joints of the wooden beams that hold the structure together.<p class=message>That's amazing. And what about the pagoda? It looks like something straight out of a storybook.<p class="message sent">Yes, the three-tiered pagoda is also a famous symbol of the temple. It's said to be a wish-granting spot.<p class=message>I definitely made a wish! And I can't wait to try the famous Otowa Waterfall. I heard it has healing powers.<p class="message sent">Yes, the holy water is divided into three streams, each with its own specific benefit.<p class=message>This is truly an incredible place. I can't wait to write about it in my travel book.<p class="message sent">I'm sure your readers will be captivated by the beauty and history of Kiyomizu-dera. Just be careful not to fall off the stage!<p class=message>Haha, I'll try my best. Thank you for guiding me through this incredible experience.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3f4f2abf-4399-4abd-a666-7d2d90e12a34.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
