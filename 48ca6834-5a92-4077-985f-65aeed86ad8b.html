How is everything going in the restaurant?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon, A. It's been busy but we are managing. We've had a lot of happy customers today.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I think our new menu has been a hit.<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely. The new desserts are especially popular. Have you tried the chocolate lava cake?<p class=message>Not yet, but it sounds delicious. I think I'll have to try it soon.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, it's one of my favorites. And speaking of favorites, have you had any interesting customer interactions today?<p class=message>Well, there was a gentleman who insisted on ordering his steak blue rare. I don't think I've ever seen anyone eat a steak quite like that.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's quite rare indeed. Did he like it?<p class=message>He said it was perfect, so I guess it just goes to show that everyone has their own preferences.<p class="message sent">That's true. Speaking of preferences, do you think we should start offering vegetarian options on our menu?<p class=message>That's a great idea. I was actually thinking about that recently. It's important to cater to all dietary needs.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'll start doing some research and we can add some delicious vegetarian dishes to our menu.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Overall, I'm really pleased with how things are going in the restaurant.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. It's always great to know that our customers are leaving happy and satisfied.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=48c76eca-f3c6-4a73-9340-f1359a54ca95.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
