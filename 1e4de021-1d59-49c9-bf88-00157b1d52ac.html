How's life treating you these days?<p class="message sent">Oh, not so bad, A. Just busy with all the new drink creations we've been working on.<p class=message>Speaking of new drinks, I heard you have a new one you've been working on. Mind if I try it?<p class="message sent">Of course not! That's why we're here. You'll definitely want to taste the 'Seoul Mule.' It's a unique mix of ginger beer and Korean soju.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. Let me give it a try. Who knows, it might even make the menu!<p class="message sent">That's the plan! We've had some great feedback on it already.<p class=message>Wow, this drink is really good! The combination of the ginger beer and soju is the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it. We've also been trying to incorporate traditional Korean ingredients into our drinks.<p class=message>That's a great idea. It really sets you apart from other bars in town.<p class="message sent">Exactly! We want to make sure our customers leave with a unique and unforgettable experience.<p class=message>Well, you've certainly accomplished that tonight. What other new drinks do you have in the works?<p class="message sent">We're working on a soju-based cocktail with pomegranate juice and lime. It's still in the testing phase, but I have a feeling it's going to be a hit.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! Can't wait to try it when it's ready.<p class="message sent">You'll be the first one to try it, A.<p class=message>Thanks, B. Speaking of which, I think I'll have another 'Seoul Mule' before we leave.<p class="message sent">Coming right up! And let me know if you need any suggestions on some Korean bar snacks to go with it.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Cheers, B.<p class="message sent">Cheers, A. Always a pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1e4ca538-139a-4ec0-ba08-f631e4c094c2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
