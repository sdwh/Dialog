It's great to see you here at the construction site.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. It's exciting to finally see the project coming to life.<p class=message>Definitely! Did you have a chance to review the latest design proposal I sent over last week?<p class="message sent">Yes, and I must say I am very impressed. The sleek modern design is exactly what I was hoping for.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. The team has been working hard to make sure we're delivering a space that meets all your needs and fits your vision.<p class="message sent">One thing I was wondering about though is the outdoor seating. It's a bit exposed to the sun during the afternoon, do you have any ideas to address that?<p class=message>Actually, we have installed a retractable awning that will provide shading during the hottest hours. It will also add a nice touch of flexibility to the space.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. I'm really looking forward to enjoying a coffee there on a sunny day.<p class=message>Me too, B. And speaking of which, the new caf√© next door has opened up. Would you like to grab a quick bite to eat?<p class="message sent">Sounds great, I hear they have some amazing pastries.<p class=message>Yes, their croissants are my favorite. Let's go check them out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=feae8d1d-3ff1-420c-ad75-6cec292cafba.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
