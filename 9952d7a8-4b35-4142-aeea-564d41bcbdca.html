It seems to have gone missing on my flight.<p class="message sent">Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Let's see if we can find out what happened. What flight were you on?<p class=message>I was on flight 123 from New York to London.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me check. It looks like your luggage was tagged for another flight by mistake. It's currently on its way to Tokyo.<p class=message>Tokyo? I'm not going to Tokyo!<p class="message sent">I know, I know, it's quite the detour. But don't worry, we'll have it sent back to you as soon as possible.<p class=message>Well, I hope it's enjoying its travels more than I am right now!<p class="message sent">(chuckles) I'll make sure to let it know. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>No, I think that's all. Thanks for your help, though.<p class="message sent">Of course, always happy to assist. Have a good day, and hopefully your luggage will be reunited with you soon!<p class=message>Thanks, fingers crossed.
