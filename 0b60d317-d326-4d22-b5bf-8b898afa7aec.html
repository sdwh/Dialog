Ready for another day?<p class="message received message-content">As ready as I'll ever be. I see we have a full schedule today.<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, we have a mix of regular patients and some new ones. Are you excited?<p class="message received message-content">Always excited to meet new patients and learn their stories. It's what makes this job interesting.<p class="message sent message-content">I agree. By the way, have you tried the new coffee shop down the street?<p class="message received message-content">Not yet, is it any good?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, it's amazing! They even have a latte with your face printed on top.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds hilarious. I should try it sometime.<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely. Oh, and quick reminder, our patient at 10 AM is deaf so we'll need to communicate through sign language.<p class="message received message-content">Oh, right. Thanks for reminding me. I'll start practicing my signs now.<p class="message sent message-content">(laughs) You always say that, but you're never as good as you think.<p class="message received message-content">Hey, sign language is hard! But I'll try my best to communicate effectively.<p class="message sent message-content">I'm sure you will, Doc. Well, time to get ready for today's patients. Let's do this!<p class="message received message-content">Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0b5eb891-a209-4e15-8a28-555b719df199.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
