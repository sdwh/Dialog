Have you heard about ISO 27001 policies and procedures?<p class="message sent">Yeah! I'm pretty familiar with them. They're all about information security management.<p class=message>That's right! And do you know how they define and classify policies and procedures?<p class="message sent">I do! Policies are high-level statements that guide decision-making, while procedures are step-by-step instructions for carrying out tasks.<p class=message>Bingo! And what about the classification?<p class="message sent">Well, there are three levels: 1) policy, which applies to the entire organization, 2) procedure, which outlines how specific processes should be carried out, and 3) work instruction, which is a detailed guide for specific tasks.<p class=message>You got it! So which level do you think is the most important?<p class="message sent">I would say the policy level, because it sets the direction and tone for the whole organization.<p class=message>I see your point. But don't you think the work instructions are equally important?<p class="message sent">Of course they are! Without clear instructions, tasks could be done incorrectly, leading to mistakes and security breaches.<p class=message>Absolutely. That's why it's important to have a solid framework like ISO 27001 in place.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And by following it, we can ensure that our organization's information assets are properly protected.<p class=message>And that's what true information security management is all about.<p class="message sent">Well said! It's great to discuss such important topics in a lighthearted way.<p class=message>It sure is! Thanks for chatting with me about this. I always learn something new from you.<p class="message sent">My pleasure! Anytime we can broaden our knowledge is a good time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8b93b786-590f-405c-a184-04315f11366c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
