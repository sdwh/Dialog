What are you working on today?<p class="message sent">Oh, hi! I'm making some traditional candies from Chaozhou. Would you like to try some?<p class=message>Definitely! What kind of candies are they?<p class="message sent">They're called "meisan mian". It's made from rice flour, sugar and maltose syrup, and it has a chewy texture.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! How do you make it?<p class="message sent">First, we mix the rice flour and sugar together, and then shape it into a flat disc. We then add the maltose syrup to give it that signature chewy texture.<p class=message>That seems simple enough. How long does it usually take to make a batch?<p class="message sent">It can take up to three hours to make a batch, but it's worth it for the taste.<p class=message>I can imagine. Do you have any other popular candies?<p class="message sent">Yes, we also have "lian gao" which is glutinous rice cake filled with sweet bean paste, and "ganghuagao" which is a type of crispy candy.<p class=message>Wow, you certainly have a variety of sweets! Do you sell them all year round?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do! People love them as gifts for holidays, birthdays, and special occasions.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I think I'll have to get some for my friends and family too. Thanks for the introduction!<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to share our traditions with others. Enjoy the candies!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3dcbe84c-f073-47f7-9ca9-bce2d0aeb6b9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
