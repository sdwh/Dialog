Long time no see! How've you been?<p class="message sent">Not bad, A. Just busy dealing with all these DDoS attacks lately.<p class=message>Ah, that sucks. How are you guys handling them?<p class="message sent">It's been a bit of a struggle, but we're working on improving our DDoS protection and response systems.<p class=message>Nice. Have you tried using any third-party services for protection?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we've had some success with a few vendors for proxy and firewall services.<p class=message>Cool. What about mitigation strategies? Any new ideas there?<p class="message sent">We're looking at dynamic rate limiting and more aggressive filtering techniques. Things are always evolving in the cyber defense landscape.<p class=message>Definitely. It's like playing whack-a-mole sometimes.<p class="message sent">You got that right! But hey, it keeps us on our toes, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. How about more advanced solutions, like machine learning or AI-driven systems?<p class="message sent">Definitely a possibility in the future, but for now we're focused on improving our current systems and processes.<p class=message>Makes sense. Have you guys run any simulations or drills to prepare for a major attack?<p class="message sent">Of course. We're always running mock exercises to make sure we're as prepared as possible.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Have you noticed any specific trends or patterns in the attacks you're facing?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we're seeing an increase in botnet-powered attacks and DNS amplification techniques.<p class=message>Hmm, that sounds tricky. Have you been collaborating with other companies or organizations to share intel on attacks?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's essential to have a strong network of contacts in the cybersecurity community to stay ahead of the latest threats.<p class=message>That's really smart. Have you ever thought about branching out into offensive security or ethical hacking?<p class="message sent">Actually, quite a few of our team members have experience in those fields. It's important to have a well-rounded perspective on cybersecurity.<p class=message>Makes sense. Well, it sounds like you guys are doing a great job handling these attacks. Keep up the good work, B!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. Always great to catch up and share ideas.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b5e8f95c-d35f-4715-810b-2db9353a22f8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
