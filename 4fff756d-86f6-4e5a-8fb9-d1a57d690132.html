Safety is our top priority here. Do you have any questions or concerns?<p class=message>I think I got everything covered, but I'd like to ask, what do I do in case of a water landing?<p class="message sent">In the unlikely event of a water landing, put on the life vest as instructed by the crew and exit through the nearest emergency exit.<p class=message>Haha, thanks for that. I hope we don't have to experience it. So, what about smoking on the plane?<p class="message sent">Smoking is not allowed on the plane, but we do have designated smoking areas once we arrive at the airport.<p class=message>That's good to know. Now, what if I need to use the restroom during the flight?<p class="message sent">There are restrooms located at the front and rear of the cabin. Please follow the illuminated signs above the seats when the seatbelt sign is off.<p class=message>Alright, thank you. What other safety precautions would you suggest for a comfortable flight?<p class="message sent">We suggest keeping your seatbelt fastened at all times when seated, and also to stow your carry-on bags in the overhead compartment or under the seat in front of you.<p class=message>I appreciate it, I feel more at ease now. How about the life vests? How do I use them?<p class="message sent">The life vest is located under your seat or attached to the underside of your armrest. Please refer to the safety card in the seat pocket for instructions on how to use it.<p class=message>Got it. I'll check it out before we take off. Thanks for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with before we board?<p class=message>No, that's it. Thanks again for your assistance.<p class="message sent">My pleasure! Have a safe and pleasant flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4ffed69a-f853-45cd-b840-1e405c2fa04f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
