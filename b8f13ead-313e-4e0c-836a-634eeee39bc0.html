I am Officer A and I will be conducting this investigation. May I have your name, please?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon, officer. My name is James. James Smith.<p class=message>Alright, Mr. Smith. Can you tell me why you were arrested earlier today?<p class="message sent">Well, officer, it's all just a misunderstanding. I was simply borrowing a friend's car and I thought it was okay to drive it even without a license.<p class=message>Mr. Smith, you do understand that driving without a license is against the law, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, officer. I do realize that now. But you see, I really needed to get to my appointment and I didn't have any other means of transportation.<p class=message>I understand, Mr. Smith. However, breaking the law is not the answer. Do you have anything else you want to say?<p class="message sent">Yes, officer. I'm sorry for what I did. I promise not to do it again. Can I just get a warning this time?<p class=message>I appreciate your apology, Mr. Smith. However, driving without a license is a serious offense. I'm afraid I cannot just let you go with a warning. You will have to face the consequences.<p class="message sent">I understand, officer. Whatever it takes to make things right.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Now, let's proceed with the paperwork and the booking process. Do you have any questions for me?<p class="message sent">No, officer. I think I understand everything. Thank you for your assistance.<p class=message>You're welcome, Mr. Smith. Just remember to follow the rules and regulations next time. Have a good day.<p class="message sent">You too, officer. Thank you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b8edea79-05f4-499e-b5af-015daebcfc82.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
