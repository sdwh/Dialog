Where are you headed today?<p class=message>I need to get to the airport, I'm headed to Madrid.<p class="message sent">Ah, beautiful city! I was born and raised there myself.<p class=message>No way! Any tips for a first-time visitor?<p class="message sent">Definitely visit the Royal Palace and the Prado Museum. And be sure to try the churros con chocolate!<p class=message>That sounds amazing, I'll have to make sure to try that. Do you have a favorite spot for churros?<p class="message sent">My absolute favorite is Chocolatería San Ginés, it's been around since 1894.<p class=message>Wow, that's a lot of history! Speaking of history, do you have any recommended historical sites to visit?<p class="message sent">The Temple of Debod and the Almudena Cathedral are both must-see destinations for history buffs.<p class=message>Thank you, I'll definitely add those to my list. How long have you been driving taxis?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for over 20 years now. It's a great way to meet people and see new places.<p class=message>I can imagine, it sounds like you have some great stories!<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've seen some interesting things over the years. Like the time a famous actor left his phone in my cab!<p class=message>Really? Who was it?<p class="message sent">I'm afraid I have to keep that a secret. But let's just say he's been in some pretty big movies.<p class=message>Ooh, mysterious! Well, thank you for the conversation and for the great tips. I'll be sure to recommend you to my friends if they ever need a taxi in Madrid.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, and have a great trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e3300405-e944-45f8-bd16-74a4b353c0ac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
