How about your soya bean stall?<p class=message>Same here, customers love to pair their chicken rice with a cup of soya bean milk.<p class="message sent">Definitely, isn't that what breakfast in Singapore is all about? Speaking of which, have you tried my snack for today?<p class=message>Oh really? What do you have there?<p class="message sent">It's a new recipe I've been trying out, it's called the 'Soya Bean Fritter'.<p class=message>That sounds intriguing. How does it taste?<p class="message sent">It's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a hint of sweetness from the soya bean. I think people will love it.<p class=message>You had me at crispy. Let me try one, please.<p class="message sent">Sure, let me know what you think.<p class=message>Mm, this is really good! Maybe we can start selling it as a combo meal with the chicken rice.<p class="message sent">Great idea, let's collaborate and market it together.<p class=message>Yes, that would be fantastic. I'm excited to see how our customers will react.<p class="message sent">Me too. Do you mind sharing some tips on how you make your chicken rice so fragrant and fluffy? I can never seem to get it right.<p class=message>Of course not, it's all about the quality of the rice and the right amount of pandan leaves and ginger. Let me show you.<p class="message sent">That's very kind of you, thank you. It's always great to learn from other food vendors.<p class=message>No problem, we're all in this together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a1e7f30d-2b41-4478-adca-e871df4e5d4e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
