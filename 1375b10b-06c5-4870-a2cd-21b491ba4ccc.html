By the way, have you had the chance to look at the new menu designs?<p class="message sent">Yeah, they look fantastic! I really like the new dishes you added.<p class=message>I appreciate that. I tried to add some new flavors and ingredients that I think will be a hit with our customers.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm especially excited about the grilled vegetable salad. It seems like a perfect summer dish.<p class=message>Glad to hear that. I was also thinking of adding in some more exotic ingredients like truffle oil and figs. What do you think?<p class="message sent">I think it's a great idea! It will definitely set us apart from other restaurants in the area.<p class=message>That's what I'm hoping for. It's all about standing out and creating a memorable dining experience for our guests.<p class="message sent">Speaking of ingredients, have you thought about sourcing them locally? It's a trend that's been gaining popularity, and I think it would be great for our restaurant's image.<p class=message>Absolutely. I've already made inquiries with some local farmers to see what they have to offer. We can also incorporate some indigenous South African ingredients into our dishes for a unique touch.<p class="message sent">That's awesome! I can't wait to experiment with these new ingredients and create some delicious dishes.<p class=message>Same here, B. I think it's going to be an exciting journey for us and for our customers. Let's get cooking!<p class="message sent">Let's do it! I'm pumped.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1370095c-cc02-42b5-b73e-cd88bddddd11.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
