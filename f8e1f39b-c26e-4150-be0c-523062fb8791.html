It looks amazing!<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did. But did you notice the lack of consistency in the layout?<p class=message>Hmm, I didn't really pay attention to that. What do you mean by lack of consistency?<p class="message sent">Well, some of the pages have different font sizes and color schemes, even though they belong to the same category. This can be confusing for users.<p class=message>Oh, I see what you mean. But isn't it a matter of personal preference?<p class="message sent">Not really. Users have grown accustomed to certain design standards and deviating from them can affect their experience negatively.<p class=message>Okay, I get it. Then we should stick to the usual design elements that are common in websites, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. Also, it's important to keep in mind the hierarchy of the page elements. Users should be able to easily locate what they need.<p class=message>Makes sense. And what do you think about the loading time? Is it too slow?<p class="message sent">I have noticed the website takes a bit too long to load. It's crucial to optimize the images and reduce the file sizes to make the website load faster.<p class=message>Good point. How about the mobile responsiveness?<p class="message sent">It's essential to ensure that the website is easily navigable and accessible on different mobile devices. Responsive web design is key.<p class=message>I agree. Thanks for sharing your insights. I'll take these into consideration when designing the next update.<p class="message sent">No problem!
