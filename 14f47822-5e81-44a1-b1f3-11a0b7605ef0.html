What can I do for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I was just admiring the beautiful cakes and treats you have on display. Can you tell me more about them?<p class=message>Of course! We have a variety of specialty desserts, including our famous matcha mille-crepe cake and strawberry zabaglione tart.<p class="message sent">Wow, those sound amazing. I would love to pair them with a delicious coffee. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Our Ethiopian single origin beans make a great pour-over coffee. It has notes of raspberry and black tea, which pairs well with our matcha dessert.<p class="message sent">Hmmm, that sounds interesting. Can you make me a pour-over coffee with those beans?<p class=message>Absolutely! I'll start brewing it now. In the meantime, would you like to try our matcha latte or cappuccino?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! The matcha latte sounds perfect.<p class=message>Great choice! Our matcha latte is made with ceremonial-grade matcha powder and organic milk for a creamy and smooth taste.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. By the way, how long have you been a pastry chef?<p class=message>I've been a pastry chef for over 10 years now. I started my career in Japan and learned traditional Japanese desserts, which inspired me to create unique and fusion desserts like our matcha mille-crepe cake.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. You must have a lot of experience and knowledge about desserts.<p class=message>Yes, I'm always learning and experimenting with new ingredients and techniques. It's a fun and creative process.<p class="message sent">I can imagine! Here's my pour-over coffee. It smells amazing.<p class=message>Thank you! I'm glad you like it. Enjoy your coffee and dessert.<p class="message sent">Thank you! This is the perfect treat to start my day. I'll definitely come back for more.<p class=message>We'd be happy to have you back anytime. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=14f474c2-aa85-40cb-8928-7b24587ab39e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
