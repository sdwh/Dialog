Have a seat, please. How can I assist you with your financial report?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Ms. Johnson. I was hoping you could help me understand some of the figures in my report. I’m having trouble interpreting them.<p class=message>Absolutely. Let’s go over them together. Which figures specifically are you struggling with?<p class="message sent">Well, for one, I’m not sure what the current ratio means. And what is EBITDA?<p class=message>The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company’s ability to cover its short-term obligations. And EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. It’s a measure of a company’s operating performance.<p class="message sent">I see. That’s very helpful. How are my company’s numbers looking overall?<p class=message>Your company is doing quite well. Your revenue has increased by 12% since last year, and your net income has seen a 5% increase as well. Your balance sheet also shows a healthy amount of cash and short-term assets.<p class="message sent">That’s good to hear. Thank you for clarifying those terms for me. I’m feeling more confident about presenting this report to my colleagues now.<p class=message>You’re welcome, Mr. Smith. I’m always happy to help. Is there anything else you’d like me to go over?<p class="message sent">No, that’s all for now. Thanks again for your assistance.<p class=message>Of course. Let me know if you have any questions in the future. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=49291d99-7041-4dd3-b2e7-2233e08e9fd8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
