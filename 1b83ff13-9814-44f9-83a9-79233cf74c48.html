Can you recommend me a good tea blend to start with for a new recipe?<p class="message sent">Of course! Are you looking for something floral, fruity or perhaps a more robust flavor?<p class=message>Maybe something floral, to complement the sweetness of my recipe.<p class="message sent">In that case, I recommend our Jasmine Green Tea. It has a delicate floral aroma and flavor that pairs well with sweet dishes.<p class=message>Great, I think that would be perfect. Can you also suggest a tea-infused cocktail?<p class="message sent">How about using our Earl Grey tea? It has a bold, citrusy flavor that would make a great base for a cocktail. Add some lemon juice and simple syrup to balance it out.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! Can we try it out now?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I'll prepare the tea and the ingredients for the cocktail. What other flavors would you like to add?<p class=message>I was thinking some fresh mint leaves, and maybe a touch of elderflower liqueur.<p class="message sent">Excellent choices! These will add a refreshing twist to the cocktail. Here you go, one Earl Grey tea and all the ingredients to try your new recipe!<p class=message>Thank you so much! Let me give it a tryâ€¦ Mmm, this is amazing! The combination of the tea, mint, and elderflower is just perfect.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it. It's always exciting to experiment with new blends and flavors. Who knows, maybe your recipe will be the next big hit!<p class=message>That would be amazing! Thanks for your help and expertise. I'll definitely come back to try some more of your tea blends.<p class="message sent">You're welcome anytime. We always have something new and exciting to discover here in our tea bar.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1b80116f-b63c-470f-a0e0-f2ec2d710a81.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
