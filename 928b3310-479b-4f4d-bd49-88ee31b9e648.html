How's the software development going?<p class="message sent">Hey A, everything's going great. We've been busy trying to fix some of the bugs.<p class=message>That's awesome. Speaking of bugs, have you run a source code analysis to identify vulnerabilities?<p class="message sent">Yes, we did that last week. We found some issues and have been working on addressing them.<p class=message>Good to hear that. What approach did you use for fixing the vulnerabilities?<p class="message sent">We utilized a patch for some of the issues while for others, we rewrote some of the code to eliminate the vulnerability.<p class=message>That's impressive, B. How confident are you that the vulnerabilities have been fully addressed?<p class="message sent">We ran some tests after applying the patches and rewrote the code. So, we're pretty confident that the vulnerabilities have been taken care of.<p class=message>That's reassuring. It's always better to be proactive than wait for a breach to occur.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's our duty to ensure that the software is secure and to adhere to best practices.<p class=message>Definitely. By the way, have you had any time to relax after all this work?<p class="message sent">I took a short break last weekend and went hiking. It was a great way to recharge.<p class=message>That sounds fantastic. I'm planning to go camping next weekend. Maybe you can join me if you're free?<p class="message sent">I'd love to. It would be great to take a break from coding and enjoy nature.<p class=message>Awesome, we'll plan the trip over lunch. Speaking of lunch, are you craving for anything specific?<p class="message sent">I could go for some good old-fashioned pizza. What about you?<p class=message>That sounds perfect. Let's go and grab a slice.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=928ab7e3-6a42-412b-862d-53463ca32f70.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
