What exactly are pupusas?<p class=message>Pupusas are a traditional dish from El Salvador. It's like a thick corn tortilla stuffed with cheese, beans, or meat.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that sounds delicious! Have you tried making them at home?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's actually not that difficult to make. You just need masa harina, water, and your choice of filling.<p class="message sent">That's good to know! I might have to try making them myself then.<p class=message>Definitely give it a try! But if you don't have the time or patience, there are plenty of places you can find them in town.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've seen a few restaurants around here that serve them. Do you have a favorite pupusa place?<p class=message>Oh, I definitely do. There's this one spot on 5th street that has the most amazing pupusas I've ever tasted.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendation! I'll have to check it out soon. Do you have a favorite filling?<p class=message>I love the classic cheese and pork filling. It's so savory and satisfying.<p class="message sent">Mmm, that sounds delicious. I might have to try that one myself.<p class=message>You definitely should! But make sure to top it off with some curtido, which is a slaw made with cabbage, vinegar, and chili peppers. It's the perfect complement to a hot and fresh pupusa.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tip! I'll make sure to try it with curtido next time. This conversation is making me really hungry!<p class=message>I know, right? Talking about pupusas always does that to me. Let's go find a pupuseria and get our fix!<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it! I'm craving some authentic Salvadoran food now.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1e02a8ea-eccc-48f0-a7f5-53bd05de562e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
