I guess I was feeling a little too bad to the bone.<p class=message>So, what did the officer say to you during questioning?<p class="message sent">Well, at first I was a little nervous, but the officer was actually really friendly.<p class=message>That's good to hear. What did he ask you?<p class="message sent">He asked me why I did it and then he started cracking some jokes. We ended up chatting about our favorite candy.<p class=message>Wow, sounds like you made a new friend. Did he at least let you off with a warning?<p class="message sent">Yeah, he was a good guy. He let me off with a warning, but not before he made me promise to never steal candy again.<p class=message>Well, you better stick to your promise or you'll really end up in the slammer.<p class="message sent">You're right, it's not worth getting caught for a lousy pack of candy.<p class=message>So, what lesson did you learn from all this?<p class="message sent">I learned that crime doesn't pay. But hey, at least I got a good story out of it.<p class=message>True, and maybe next time you'll think twice before committing a sweet crime.<p class="message sent">Yeah, maybe I'll just stick to buying candy like a law-abiding citizen.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=716f53a6-a3e9-4d6d-9fda-96dcd69561bb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
