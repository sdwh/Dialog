How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks for asking. What's on the menu today?<p class="message sent">We have our new specialty coffee, and I baked some fresh blueberry scones this morning.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I made some mini cheesecakes today, would you like to try one?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! I've heard great things about your cheesecakes.<p class=message>Thank you, I hope you enjoy it. So, how has business been lately?<p class="message sent">It's been pretty busy, especially during weekends. How about yours?<p class=message>Same here. I think people are starting to crave some good desserts and coffee after being stuck at home for so long.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Speaking of which, have you tried our new blend of espresso beans?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm excited to give it a try. How would you describe it?<p class="message sent">It's a medium roast with hints of chocolate and caramel, and a smooth finish. Would you like a taste?<p class=message>Sure, thank you! Wow, that's really good. I might have to order one myself.<p class="message sent">Glad you like it. And your mini cheesecake is amazing too. I might have to steal your recipe.<p class=message>Haha, I could give you some tips if you'd like. But don't tell anyone it's a secret.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Thanks, A! Let's keep serving up some delicious treats and coffee.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3733ed02-e9f3-4224-95a6-6d04470a3c9b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
