Can I please have your name and departure city?<p class="message received message-content">My name is Sarah and I'm departing from New York JFK.<p class="message sent message-content">Great, let me just pull that up for you... Yes, I see that you're booked on flight 123 to Los Angeles.<p class="message received message-content">Perfect, that's the one I wanted. What time is it scheduled to depart?<p class="message sent message-content">It's scheduled to depart at 10:30am Eastern Standard Time.<p class="message received message-content">Wonderful! Is there a chance that it could be delayed?<p class="message sent message-content">Unfortunately, it's hard to predict, but as of now it's on time.<p class="message received message-content">No worries, I have plenty of time to spare. By the way, do you have any recommendations on what to do in LA?<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely! There are so many great things to do. Have you checked out the beaches yet?<p class="message received message-content">I haven't! Which one do you recommend?<p class="message sent message-content">It depends on what you're looking for. If you want somewhere quiet, check out Hermosa Beach. If you want something a bit more lively with lots of activities, try Santa Monica Beach.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds like I have some exploring to do. Thank you for the recommendation!<p class="message sent message-content">Anytime. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class="message received message-content">That's all for now. Thanks again for your help. Have a great day!<p class="message sent message-content">You're welcome, Sarah. Have a safe and enjoyable flight tomorrow!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=042de076-a0cd-417b-b537-0fbc9919466c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
