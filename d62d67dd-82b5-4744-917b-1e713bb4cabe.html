What approaches have you been considering?<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking we could try using a server-side rendering framework to speed things up. But I'm not sure if that's the best option.<p class=message>Hmm, I'm more of a fan of using client-side rendering myself. We could go with a modern JavaScript framework like React or Vue, which can really speed things up.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Those frameworks are definitely faster than older technologies like jQuery. And we could also use something like webpack to optimize the build process and make sure everything runs smoothly.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we should also make sure we're using a content delivery network to speed up page loading times for users all around the world.<p class="message sent">Yeah, good idea. And we could also use something like lazy loading to only load the assets that are necessary on each page.<p class=message>Exactly. And we should make sure to use proper image compression as well, so that our images aren't slowing down the page load times.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. And do you have any tips for making things more reliable?<p class=message>Well, we can use error tracking tools like Sentry to quickly diagnose and fix any problems that arise. And we should also make sure we're doing proper testing and QA to catch any issues before they go live.<p class="message sent">I'm on board with all of that. I think we're on the right track to designing a really great frontend that's both fast and reliable.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's get to work and make it happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d62c5636-16bb-48a6-b4e4-d312c038e3b7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
