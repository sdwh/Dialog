I stumbled upon a hidden easter egg in the program.<p class=message>That sounds fun. What does it do?<p class="message sent">Whenever you input a specific combination of letters, it plays a silly sound clip.<p class=message>Haha, that's great! Did you share the glitch with the team yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, I wanted to fix it first. Who knows what kind of unintended consequences the glitch could cause.<p class=message>That's responsible of you. Have you figured out how to fix it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I think so. I'm going to add a conditional statement to disable the easter egg feature.<p class=message>Good plan. I'll run a few tests to make sure it doesn't cause any new issues.<p class="message sent">Thanks. And hey, have you seen the new cat-themed keyboard I got?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Let me see. Oh, that's adorable! Where did you get it?<p class="message sent">I found it on an online store. It was too cute to pass up.<p class=message>I know how you feel. I once bought a dinosaur-shaped mouse.<p class="message sent">Really? That's hilarious. Did it work well?<p class=message>It did, but it wasn't very ergonomic. It looked cool, but I had to retire it eventually.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I understand. Sometimes functionality has to win over aesthetics.<p class=message>Speaking of functionality, have you tried out the updated version of our program yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I heard there are some exciting new features. I can't wait to check it out.<p class=message>Definitely give it a try. I think you'll really like it.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks for the heads up.<p class=message>No problem. And thanks for sharing the easter egg discovery. It brightened up my day.<p class="message sent">Anytime. It's always fun to find something unexpected in the code.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d11d3e00-f13b-4ccf-8981-273b0ba40eab.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
