How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hi, doctor. I'm feeling a little under the weather. I've been coughing a lot lately.<p class=message>I'm sorry to hear that. Let's check your temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen levels first.<p class="message sent">Sure, no problem. You know, I'm not a big fan of needles.<p class=message>Don't worry, we'll only need a small blood sample to check for any infections.<p class="message sent">Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. So, doctor, have you watched any good movies lately?<p class=message>Yes, I watched a funny movie last night. It was about a group of friends who started their own business.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. I haven't watched a good movie in a while. Do you recommend any?<p class=message>Well, if you like action movies, I recommend the latest James Bond movie. It's really exciting.<p class="message sent">I've always been a fan of James Bond movies. Thanks for the recommendation, doctor.<p class=message>No problem. So, let me listen to your chest and see if there's any congestion.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. *takes deep breaths*<p class=message>Hmm, it sounds like there's some congestion in your chest. I'll prescribe some medicine to help with that.<p class="message sent">Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.<p class=message>No problem. Just make sure to take the medicine as instructed and get plenty of rest.<p class="message sent">Will do. By the way, have you tried any new restaurants in town?<p class=message>Yes, I tried a new sushi place last weekend. It was really good.<p class="message sent">I love sushi! Which restaurant was it?<p class=message>It's called Sushi Aoki. You should definitely check it out.<p class="message sent">I'll try it out. Thanks again, doctor.<p class=message>You're welcome, Mr. B. Take care and feel better soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ce747df5-691a-4279-bd55-74b47aec9d8f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
