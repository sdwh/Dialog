I see you have some fresh fruits there. I am a local farmer and I have some fruits to sell too. Can you give me some tips on how to sell them like hotcakes?<p class="message sent">Of course! First of all, it's important to showcase your best fruits. Perhaps you could display them at the front of your stall or arrange them in an eye-catching manner. Second, make sure to give samples to potential customers. They'll be more likely to buy if they've tasted it.<p class=message>That's a good idea. Can I offer them in different sizes and prices?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Customers like to have options. You could also offer a discount if they buy in bulk.<p class=message>What about branding or packaging? Do you think it's important?<p class="message sent">It's not necessary, but it certainly helps. Having a brand or packaging can help customers remember your fruits and come back for more. Plus, it adds a professional touch to your business.<p class=message>That's true. Thank you so much for your advice. By the way, do you have any tips on how to attract more customers to the market?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's easy. You could put up posters or flyers around town or use social media to promote your market. You could also offer some entertainment or activities for families to enjoy while they shop.<p class=message>These are great ideas. Thanks for your help.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to assist. Goodluck with your fruit selling!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=46f32020-3df7-4bbf-81a7-fd91b68c800b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
