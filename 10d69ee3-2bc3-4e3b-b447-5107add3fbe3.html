It's nice to meet you, our tour guide.<p class="message sent">Hey there! I'm excited to learn about making authentic Spanish chocolate.<p class=message>Have you ever made chocolate before?<p class="message sent">No, this is my first time. What about you?<p class=message>I've been making chocolate for over ten years now. It's my passion.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's amazing. So, where do we start?<p class=message>First, we need to roast the cacao beans to bring out their rich flavors.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. How long does it take to roast the beans?<p class=message>It takes about 30 minutes. While the beans are roasting, we can talk more about the history of chocolate.<p class="message sent">I didn't know that chocolate had such a rich history. Tell me more.<p class=message>Well, chocolate dates back to the ancient Aztecs and Mayans. They considered it a sacred drink. In Europe, chocolate was initially only for the rich.<p class="message sent">That's fascinating! I can't wait to try it for myself.<p class=message>Next, we need to grind the roasted beans into a paste. Would you like to try?<p class="message sent">Sure, why not? How hard can it be?<p class=message>It can be quite challenging, but I'll guide you through it. You need to apply enough pressure to the grinder and keep the beans moving.<p class="message sent">Phew! This is hard work, but it's worth it. What's next?<p class=message>We temper the chocolate by heating and cooling it to create a shiny finish. It's a delicate process that requires precision and patience.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. I think I'll leave that to the expert. Can't wait to taste the final product!<p class=message>It won't be long now. We just need to pour the chocolate into molds, let it set, and voila! Authentic Spanish chocolate.<p class="message sent">This has been an amazing experience. Thank you for teaching me how to make chocolate, and for sharing the history and the love behind it.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. Now, let's enjoy some chocolate together. Salud!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=10d56028-0957-4e1b-9fcd-53678ac5c903.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
