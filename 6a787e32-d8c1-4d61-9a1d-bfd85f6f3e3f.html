Could you take me to the nearest shopping mall?<p class=message>Of course, do you have a favorite mall around here?<p class="message sent">I don't, really. Whatever is closest will do.<p class=message>Alright, we're headed to Chadstone then. Any preferred route to avoid traffic?<p class="message sent">Not at all, you're the driver. I trust you'll take care of it.<p class=message>Great! I know a shortcut that should save us some time. So, are you from around here?<p class="message sent">No, actually, I'm visiting from Singapore.<p class=message>Oh, lovely! What brings you to Melbourne?<p class="message sent">Just taking a short vacation with my family. How about you? Are you from Melbourne?<p class=message>Yes, I am. I've lived here all my life. It's a great city, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, I'm quite impressed by the architecture here.<p class=message>Yes, it's a beautiful mix of old and new. Hey, what do you think of Australian accents?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I find them quite charming. I love the way you guys say "mate"!<p class=message>Haha, well, you certainly don't have an Australian accent yourself. Where did you learn to speak such perfect English?<p class="message sent">Thank you, I'm just fortunate to have gone to good schools with great teachers.<p class=message>That's fantastic. We're here at Chadstone, enjoy your shopping and have a great day!<p class="message sent">Thanks so much, you too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6a7743da-bb0b-4461-9a0e-2ce327dbaf8d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
