I've been working on some fun design elements to make the page more interactive.<p class=message>That's fantastic! I'm excited to see what you've come up with. Have you encountered any challenges that you need help with?<p class="message sent">Well, I did have some trouble with the responsiveness of one of the features, but I was able to fix it. Other than that, things have been smooth sailing.<p class=message>Great job, B. Keep up the good work. C, how about you?
