I'm so excited to work with you today, B.<p class="message sent">Hi! Me too! I love your pastries, so teaming up with you is such an honor.<p class=message>Thank you! I feel the same way about your pottery. How long have you been making ceramics?<p class="message sent">I've been doing pottery for about 10 years now. It's been a passion of mine ever since I took a class in college.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. I've always admired people who have an artistic talent. How did you get interested in making desserts?<p class="message sent">I've always had a sweet tooth, so I started baking when I was young. Eventually, I realized that I could combine my love for desserts with my creativity and started experimenting with pastry-making.<p class=message>That's amazing! Speaking of creativity, what kind of flavors do you suggest we feature for today's desserts?<p class="message sent">How about some matcha-infused treats? I think it would pair perfectly with the earthy tone of my pottery.<p class=message>Great idea! I have a recipe for matcha macarons that I've been dying to try out. And maybe we can make some matcha lattes as well?<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect! And I can make some clay cup sets specifically for matcha.<p class=message>Perfect. It's a matcha made in heaven! (laughs) Sorry, I couldn't resist the pun.<p class="message sent">No worries, I love a good pun. Speaking of which, have you heard about the new pottery pun book that's coming out?<p class=message>No, I haven't! Tell me more.<p class="message sent">Well, I haven't read it yet, but I hear it's going to be a clay-sic.<p class=message>(laughs) Oh my gosh, that's hilarious.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I'm glad you liked it. Maybe we can feature some pottery jokes on our menu?<p class=message>Definitely! I think our customers would appreciate it. I can't wait to see what kind of creations we come up with today.<p class="message sent">Me too! Let's get started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9f291f08-6192-45d8-acab-4828ce3e9069.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
