How's it going?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thanks. How about you, A? How's the ISO 27001 audit coming along?<p class=message>It's been a bit of a challenge, but it's going well. I could use your help, though. I noticed that there are some issues with the information security policies of your department.<p class="message sent">Really? Can you be more specific?<p class=message>Well, for instance, there doesn't seem to be a clear policy for implementing access controls on shared information databases.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. That's something we've been trying to work on. I appreciate you bringing it up.<p class=message>No problem. And by the way, have you heard about the latest phishing scam going around?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's going on?<p class=message>Apparently, hackers are sending emails that look like they're from a legitimate source, but they contain links that install malware on computers.<p class="message sent">That's awful. Thanks for letting me know. I'll make sure to inform my team about it.<p class=message>Sure thing. By the way, have you seen the new Star Wars movie yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet. I've been so busy with work. Have you seen it?<p class=message>Yeah, I did. It was pretty good, but I'm still a fan of the original trilogy.<p class="message sent">I hear you. You can't beat the classics.<p class=message>Definitely. Well, back to business. Let's get back to the audit.<p class="message sent">Right, of course. Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. And don't forget to watch out for those phishing scams!<p class="message sent">I won't. See you around, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fba7cf2c-d631-4797-9110-1cc8d3b0410c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
