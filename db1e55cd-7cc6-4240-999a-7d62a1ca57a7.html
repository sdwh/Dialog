I'm A, your partner for tonight's seafood cooking.<p class="message sent">Great to meet you, A. I heard you're a skilled fisherman. I can't wait to see what fresh hauls you have for us to cook.<p class=message>I caught some snappers, tunas, and squids today. All are freshly caught.<p class="message sent">Excellent! We'll make good use of those. Do you have any cooking preferences in mind?<p class=message>Hmm, I'm open to anything really. Perhaps you can surprise me with a dish that showcases the freshness of the seafood?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Let's start with a simple yet delicious appetizer of seared tuna with soy and ginger glaze, served with pickled julienned cucumber.<p class=message>That sounds mouth-watering. Can I watch you cook it?<p class="message sent">Definitely. You can assist me as well. First, let's season the tuna with salt and pepper before searing it on high heat.<p class=message>(Assisting with the searing) Wow, the tuna looks crispy on the outside but still pink in the middle.<p class="message sent">That's the texture we're aiming for. Now, let's make the glaze by saut√©ing garlic, ginger, and spring onions in soy sauce and honey.<p class=message>(Assisting with the glaze) The aroma is incredible. I can't wait to taste the final dish.<p class="message sent">(Plating the dish) Here you go, A. Enjoy the seared tuna with soy and ginger glaze.<p class=message>(Tasting the dish) Amazing! The savoury and sweet flavours complement each other, and the pickled cucumber adds a refreshing tang.<p class="message sent">Glad you like it. We still have lots of seafood to cook, so let's move on to the next dish.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=db106aac-5d33-48e8-9693-e7305e496f0f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
