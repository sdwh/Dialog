I'm B, and I'm excited to explore the rainforest.<p class=message>Great to have you here, B. Alright, before we start, I need to give you a short orientation about the rainforest ecosystem.<p class="message sent">Sure, go ahead.<p class=message>The rainforest is home to numerous animal species, such as kangaroos, koalas, and of course, a variety of bird species. Make sure to keep your eyes peeled for any wildlife sightings.<p class="message sent">Will do.<p class=message>We'll be doing some walking on this tour, so I suggest you wear comfortable shoes and clothes that are easy to move around in.<p class="message sent">Noted.<p class=message>Also, there are designated areas for littering, so please avoid throwing any trash in other areas.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll keep that in mind.<p class=message>Now, let's get started with the tour.

We'll take all the time you need.<p class="message sent">Hey, do you hear that sound?<p class=message>Yes, that's a lyrebird - one of the most unique bird species in the rainforest. Try to spot it if you can!<p class="message sent">I see it! Its tail feathers are so long!<p class=message>Exactly! Those feathers are what makes them unique. They can imitate almost any sound from the forest, making them one of the most talented birds.<p class="message sent">I'm so amazed.<p class=message>Yes, it's truly an incredible sight to see.
