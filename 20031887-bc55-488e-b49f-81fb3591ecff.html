What kind of budget are you working with?<p class="message sent">Around $500,000.<p class=message>Okay, we can definitely work with that. Have you thought about the layout and number of rooms you would like?<p class="message sent">I want a spacious open floor plan with a large kitchen and living area, 4 bedrooms, and 3 bathrooms.<p class=message>That's a good starting point. How about we incorporate some unique features like a skylight in the living room or a rooftop terrace?<p class="message sent">Those sound amazing! I would love to have a rooftop terrace with a garden.<p class=message>Great idea, we can definitely make that happen. Now let's talk about materials. Are you interested in using sustainable materials or anything in particular?<p class="message sent">I think it's important to use sustainable materials wherever possible. I also love the look of steel and wood, maybe a mix of both?<p class=message>Absolutely, we can definitely incorporate those materials. What about the landscaping? Do you have any preferences or requirements?<p class="message sent">I would like a low-maintenance garden with some native plants and maybe a small pond.<p class=message>Got it. We will ensure that the landscaping design complements the overall aesthetics of the house. Do you have any other requests or ideas you would like us to consider?<p class="message sent">Not at the moment, but I'm excited to see the final design and work with you on this project!<p class=message>Great, we're excited to work with you too! We will create some initial designs and present them to you soon. Let's schedule another meeting to discuss them further.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1ffbe54f-979a-4b3d-9a91-88bb0ff8d922.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
