It’s a set of standards that help organizations manage their information security, isn’t it?<p class=message>Exactly! And it’s not just for big companies. Small businesses and startups can benefit from it too.<p class="message sent">That’s great to know. But I have to admit, the name doesn’t sound very exciting.<p class=message>Haha, I know what you mean. But managing information security is serious business. ISO 27001 just makes it a little easier.<p class="message sent">Okay, fair enough. So, have you implemented ISO 27001 at your workplace?<p class=message>Not yet, but we’re planning to do it soon. We want to make sure our clients’ data is secure.<p class="message sent">That’s really responsible of you guys. And it could also give you an edge over your competitors.<p class=message>Definitely. Plus, it would be kind of cool to be able to say “we’re ISO 27001 certified.”<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah it does have a nice ring to it.<p class=message>But you know what’s even better than being certified? Actually knowing that your data is secure.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And with ISO 27001, you have a framework to follow to make sure that happens.<p class=message>And since it’s recognized worldwide, it gives your clients the assurance that you take security seriously.<p class="message sent">That’s a great point. So, when do you plan on getting certified?<p class=message>Hopefully by the end of the year. We’re just taking it one step at a time.<p class="message sent">Good luck with that! And thanks for educating me on ISO 27001 management. It’s not so boring after all.<p class=message>No problem at all. I’m always happy to share my nerdy knowledge with others.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=186e0e8d-b7c5-4c23-866d-33ec5b5e7ef4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
