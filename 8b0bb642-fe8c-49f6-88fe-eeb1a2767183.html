Is that some kind of pasta?<p class=message>No, it's actually a Vietnamese dish. It's made with rice flour and filled with pork and mushrooms. It's really delicious!<p class="message sent">Oh wow, I've never had Vietnamese food before. What's it like?<p class=message>Well, Bánh Cuốn is a type of rice roll that is steamed and served with a fish sauce-based dipping sauce. It's savory, a little bit chewy, and really satisfying.<p class="message sent">That sounds really interesting! Is it spicy at all?<p class=message>It can be, depending on how much chili sauce you add to the dipping sauce. But even without the spice, it has a lot of flavor.<p class="message sent">I'm always down to try new foods, especially if they're tasty. Thanks for telling me about it!<p class=message>No problem! It's definitely worth trying if you get the chance. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can even try making it at home.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I don't know if I'm that ambitious, but I'll keep an eye out for it on menus when I'm out and about.<p class=message>That's a good idea. But if you do decide to make it, let me know. I'd love to try your homemade Bánh Cuốn!<p class="message sent">Ha, I'll have to practice a lot first. But if I ever get it right, you'll be the first to know!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8aff1206-59da-4c87-ac11-bf4a80d312af.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
