Can you guide me through the steps?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Sure thing. Are you with us for the first time, or do you know your way around?<p class=message>It's my first time handling this process. I'm a little overwhelmed.<p class="message sent">No worries, we're here to help. So, have you prepared everything you need for the exit?<p class=message>Yes, I have my passport, travel documents, and stuff. I also settled all my bills and debts.<p class="message sent">Great! That makes our job easier. Now, we just need to inspect your baggage and do some security checks.<p class=message>I feel like I'm going through an airport! Do I also have to remove my shoes?<p class="message sent">Haha, no need for that. But we do need to scan your bags. You're not carrying anything sharp, dangerous, or illegal, are you?<p class=message>Nope, just clothes, some souvenirs, and books. And oh, my cat's litter box.<p class="message sent">Ah, a pet owner. We have a special inspection for animal-related items. Don't worry, we'll take care of it.<p class=message>That's a relief. I was afraid they'd put my cat in quarantine.<p class="message sent">Nah, we only do that if your pet has a health or behavior issue. Your cat seems healthy and well-behaved.<p class=message>Yeah, she's just a little grumpy from the long trip. Anyway, what's next after the bag check?<p class="message sent">We'll give you a certificate of clearance which you'll present to the immigration officers. They'll stamp your passport and let you go. Easy-peasy.<p class=message>I see. Thanks a lot, you've been a great help.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Bon voyage, and keep your litter box in a secure place!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bcc12c98-23be-45d7-b467-36bec5d5cce0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
