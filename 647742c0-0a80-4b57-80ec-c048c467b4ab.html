Ready for our RPG game session tonight?<p class="message sent">Hey A. Yeah, totally! I've been looking forward to it all week.<p class=message>Great. Have you decided on your character yet? I'm going with a paladin this time.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm still trying to decide. Maybe a rogue or a wizard.<p class=message>Those are both cool options. We could use some rogue skills for sneaking around and thieving.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's true. And a wizard could provide some serious firepower in battles.<p class=message>Definitely. Speaking of battles, remember when our whole party got wiped out by those goblins last week?<p class="message sent">Oh man, don't remind me. I still have PTSD from that.<p class=message>*laughs* Yeah, but we learned our lesson. We need to be more strategic in our combat approach.<p class="message sent">Agreed. So, what do you think of the new expansion that's coming out next month?<p class=message>I'm excited for it. I heard there are some new classes and quests that are being added.<p class="message sent">Nice. We should preorder it so we can start playing as soon as it's released.<p class=message>I'm ahead of you there. I already did.<p class="message sent">*laughs* Of course you did. Hey, do you have any tips for leveling up quickly? I want to catch up to your character.<p class=message>Ha! Nice try, but I'm not giving away my secrets that easily.<p class="message sent">*laughs* Alright, fair enough. Let's get started with the game. I can't wait to see what adventures await.<p class=message>Same here. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6476dbb1-43ed-415a-a964-b050bb9f6ff0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
