Can you suggest some fun things to do and see?<p class="message sent">Of course! Taichung has plenty of great attractions. Have you heard of the Fengjia Night Market? It's a must-visit spot for foodies!<p class=message>Yes, I've heard of it. What else do you suggest?<p class="message sent">You might also enjoy the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts. It has some amazing exhibitions and collections from both local and international artists.<p class=message>That sounds really interesting. Is there something that's more off the beaten track?<p class="message sent">Sure! How about visiting the Rainbow Village? It's a colorful artistic community created by a retired soldier, and it's absolutely charming!<p class=message>Oh, I've never heard of that before, but it sounds like a hidden gem. What else do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">Another fun activity would be to rent a bike and cycle around the Sun Moon Lake. It's a breathtaking view and there are several scenic points worth a stop for.<p class=message>That's an excellent idea! Do you know any good bike rental shops around there?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! There's a bike rental shop called "銀馬自行車租賃" which offers a variety of bicycles to choose from. They also have some guided tours if you'd like.<p class=message>Thank you for the recommendations. I'm really excited to explore Taichung now!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Enjoy your trip and don't hesitate to ask if you need any further assistance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=380dc961-fece-4fe6-acdb-341a89907b06.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
