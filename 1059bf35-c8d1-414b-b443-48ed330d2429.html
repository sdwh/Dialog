Are you ready to find those missing villagers?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I've got my trusty sword and shield ready to go. What about you, A?<p class=message>I've got my trusty bow and arrows at the ready, so let's get going.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Do you have any idea where to start looking?<p class=message>Not exactly, but I've heard that the villagers often go berry picking in the nearby woods. We could start our search there.<p class="message sent">That's a good lead. We should split up and cover more ground. I'll check the east end of the woods, and you can take the west.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. But, do you think we need a tracking dog?<p class="message sent">Ha! I think we'll just have to rely on our instincts this time. Now, let's get going!<p class=message>Wait, hold on a second.<p class="message sent">What's wrong?<p class=message>Do you hear that rustling in the bushes?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I hear it too. Let's investigate.<p class=message>Oh, it's just a rabbit. False alarm.<p class="message sent">Haha, we can't let a little rabbit scare us off. We have a job to do!<p class=message>That's the spirit. We won't let any obstacle stand in our way. Let's go find those missing villagers!<p class="message sent">That's the spirit, A! We'll make sure we bring those lost villagers back safely to their homes.<p class=message>Indeed, we will. With your fighting skills and my sharpshooting abilities, no challenge is too great.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's hope we find them soon though. It's getting dark and we don't want to be out here all night.<p class=message>Yes, we should pick up our pace. Let's go!<p class="message sent">I'm right behind you, A. Let's go find those villagers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=10597d2c-1bbd-4e2e-abd0-3b4851e11f8a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
