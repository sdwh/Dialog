Ready to cook up some South African cuisine tonight?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, Chef! What's on the menu for tonight?<p class=message>We have a traditional bobotie, a spicy chakalaka, and peri peri prawns. Which one do you recommend we feature as the special tonight?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'd say the peri peri prawns. They are always a hit with our customers!<p class=message>Great choice, B. Let's get started on prepping those prawns.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, Chef. While you do that, I'll make sure our guests have some delicious bread and butter to start with.<p class=message>Thanks, B! The key to making these prawns is the peri peri seasoning. It's a blend of spicy flavors that really make them pop.<p class="message sent">Ooh, that sounds tasty. Speaking of spices, have you ever tried the Cape Malay curry powder? It's a common ingredient in bobotie.<p class=message>Actually, I have! I love the subtle sweetness it adds to the dish.<p class="message sent">It's definitely a unique flavor. Our customers always appreciate trying something new when they come here.<p class=message>Absolutely. And speaking of trying something new, have you ever had ostrich meat?<p class="message sent">I haven't, but I've heard it's a popular meat in South Africa. Do we have any on the menu tonight?<p class=message>We sure do! We have a delicious ostrich steak that's been marinated in a red wine sauce.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing. I'm definitely going to have to try it.<p class=message>I highly recommend it, B. And with that peri peri seasoning on the prawns, tonight's menu is sure to be a hit!<p class="message sent">Agreed, Chef. Let's make sure our guests have a fantastic experience tonight.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=65679637-9ea5-46d2-8c95-a5631592f40e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
