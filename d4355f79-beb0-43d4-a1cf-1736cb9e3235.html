I couldn't resist but capture every perspective.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is one of the most popular tourist spots in Tokyo. It's known for its historic architecture and colorful structures.<p class=message>The torii gate at the entrance is particularly impressive. I have never seen a gate this vibrant.<p class="message sent">Itâ€™s made of wood and painted in bright vermilion. It's believed to be a way for Shinto gods to enter the shrine.<p class=message>I have a question. Do you mind telling me about the photo that Japanese tourists keep taking here?<p class="message sent">Sure, which one are you referring to?<p class=message>The one where they stand in the middle of the gate and make a heart sign with their hands.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a new trend on social media, where people pose with their hands in the shape of a heart. It symbolizes the love and appreciation for the place they visit.<p class=message>That's interesting! Speaking of social media, I think I'll upload some of these photos in a bit.<p class="message sent">Don't forget the hashtag #asakusashrine and #Tokyo!<p class=message>Right! Are there any other interesting spots around here you recommend I should take a photo of?<p class="message sent">Definitely the five-story pagoda, and the Nakamise shopping streets lined with traditional souvenirs.<p class=message>This is a perfect location for my travel photography portfolio. You have been such a great help, thank you!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It was my pleasure to assist you. Enjoy your photography session!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d42d99f3-20be-4d62-be84-fc3db9d6b8df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
