Do you have any ideas, B?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Firstly, have you tried incorporating more student-led activities and group work? This can boost their confidence and sense of responsibility.<p class=message>Yes, we have. But some of the quieter children still struggle to participate. How can we help them?<p class="message sent">Maybe try creating safe spaces where they can express themselves freely. This could be through written reflection, artwork, or just talking with a trusted adult.<p class=message>That's a great idea. In terms of emotional connection, how can we foster more positive relationships between the students and their families?<p class="message sent">Maybe have regular family involvement in school activities or even field trips. This can help them feel more connected to their child's education and strengthen their bond.<p class=message>That's fantastic. What about within the classroom itself? Any tips for promoting more positive interactions?<p class="message sent">You could have a "compliment corner" where students can write positive things about their classmates, or even start each day with a positive affirmation.<p class=message>I love those ideas! Thank you, B. I think I have some great starting points for improving our students' self-esteem and emotional connection.<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to help. Good luck with everything!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a32c30b1-6d71-47a0-8db1-e901505b1a86.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
