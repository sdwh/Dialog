How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. So, what brings you in today?<p class="message sent">I have been experiencing some stomach pains and indigestion.<p class=message>Okay, let's take a closer look. Have you been eating anything out of the ordinary or experiencing a lot of stress recently?<p class="message sent">I did have some spicy food last night, and work has been pretty busy.<p class=message>That could definitely be the cause. Let me write you a prescription for some antacids and suggest some dietary changes to help alleviate your symptoms.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, doctor. By the way, have you ever been to Canberra before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's a beautiful city with lots to see and do.<p class="message sent">I've heard that they have some great hiking trails in the area.<p class=message>Absolutely, and the weather is perfect for it right now. You always have to be careful with sunscreen, though!<p class="message sent">That's good advice. I'll make sure to pack some before I head out.<p class=message>Great, glad I could help. Take care and feel better soon.<p class="message sent">Thank you, doctor.
