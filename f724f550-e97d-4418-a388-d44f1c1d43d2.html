How are you today?<p class=message>Good morning, Patient B! I'm doing well, thank you. I hope you're feeling better today.<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. But I have to admit, being in the hospital is no fun.<p class=message>I know what you mean. But hopefully we can make your stay here as comfortable as possible. Is there anything I can get for you?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. Do you have any good book recommendations? I'm getting tired of watching TV all day.<p class=message>Of course! Have you read "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams? It's hilarious and definitely worth a read.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Thanks for the suggestion, Nurse A. Anything else you can recommend?<p class=message>If you're in the mood for something light-hearted, you could try "Bridget Jones's Diary" by Helen Fielding. It's a fun read.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. Thanks, Nurse A.<p class=message>You're welcome, Patient B. Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I'm supposed to be on a restricted diet. Can I still have ice cream?<p class=message>Hmm, let me check your chart. Looks like you're allowed it in moderation. Would you like me to get some for you?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! You're the best, Nurse A.<p class=message>I'm just doing my job, Patient B. I'm glad I could help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f72337d3-5b5e-4976-958f-c6094da21a13.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
