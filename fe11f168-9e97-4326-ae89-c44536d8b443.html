How did you sleep last night?<p class="message sent">I slept alright, thanks. The jet lag is still kicking in, but I'm glad we made it here to Tokyo for the conference.<p class=message>Yes, it's a great opportunity to discuss international trade and business development. So, let's get started. What do you think are the biggest challenges facing global trade today?<p class="message sent">Well, there are certainly a lot of obstacles like tariffs, protectionism, and currency fluctuations. But I think one major challenge is adapting to new technologies and digital platforms.<p class=message>That's a good point. Technology and automation are changing the way we do business. Speaking of which, have you tried any of the local Japanese technology like their high-speed trains?<p class="message sent">Yes, I took the bullet train from the airport to the city center. It was impressive and efficient. I wish we had something like it in our country.<p class=message>Yes, the Shinkansen is one of Japan's proudest achievements. They're always innovating and pushing the limits. Speaking of which, have you had a chance to try some of the local cuisine?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've been enjoying the sushi and tempura. And the matcha tea is quite refreshing.<p class=message>Great to hear! Japanese food is world-renowned for its quality and presentation. Have you tried any of the traditional Japanese sweets like mochi or manju?<p class="message sent">I haven't yet, but I'm open to trying anything. Maybe you could recommend a good sweet shop in town?<p class=message>Sure, I know a great one near the conference venue. I'll take you there during our lunch break.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Thanks for the recommendation, and for all your help with translation during the conference. Your language skills have been invaluable.<p class=message>My pleasure, Mr. B. I'm happy to assist in any way I can. Let's have a fruitful and enjoyable conference.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fe0eca89-2b0b-4129-b330-2b2ac8b3d9b7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
