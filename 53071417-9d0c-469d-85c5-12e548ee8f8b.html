How was your day today?<p class="message sent">Hi! It was great, thanks. I spent most of my day exploring the French Quarter. It's just amazing here.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that, sir. Have you tried some of the local cuisine yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! I had some delicious gumbo and jambalaya for lunch.
