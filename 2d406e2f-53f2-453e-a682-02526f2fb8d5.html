What is it?<p class=message>It's a type of Brazilian beef cut that's known for its tenderness and flavor. I tried it at a Brazilian steakhouse and it was amazing!<p class="message sent">That sounds quite interesting. Is it a popular dish in Brazil?<p class=message>Yes, it is. Itâ€™s actually one of the most popular cuts of meat in Brazil. People grill it with salt, and the result is amazing!<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds so good! Do you know any good place in town where we can try this?<p class=message>I've heard that there's a great Brazilian restaurant nearby that serves Picanha. It's called "Boi Na Brasa", which means "beef on the grill". Shall we give it a try?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Let's go there tomorrow for lunch.<p class=message>Great! I hope you'll like it. I'm sure you will.<p class="message sent">I'm looking forward to it. By the way, do you know how to cook Picanha?<p class=message>Well, I've never tried cooking it myself, but I heard that it's quite simple. You just need to season it with salt, and then grill it to a perfect medium-rare. Easy enough, right?<p class="message sent">That sounds like something I could try at home. Thanks for the tip!<p class=message>No problem! Just make sure you get a good quality cut of meat from the butcher.<p class="message sent">I will definitely keep that in mind. Thanks for introducing me to Picanha, A.<p class=message>My pleasure, B. I'm always happy to share my love for food with my friends.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2d3b3344-03b9-480e-8d63-2e50b6a3cd68.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
