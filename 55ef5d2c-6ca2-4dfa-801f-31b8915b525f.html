My name is Officer A. How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Officer A. I think I have been mistaken for someone else. I was just doing my usual routine when I was arrested for no reason.<p class=message>I see. Would you mind telling me what your routine is?<p class="message sent">Well, I am a juggler, and I usually juggle in the park for some extra cash. I don't see how that's illegal.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. Have you ever thought about performing in a circus?<p class="message sent">Oh, I have, but I don't really have the connections for it.<p class=message>Well, if you are willing to cooperate with us, we might be able to help you out with that. But first, could you provide me with some identification?<p class="message sent">Of course. Here you go.<p class=message>Thank you. Can you also tell me your full name, date of birth, and address?<p class="message sent">My name is John Smith, I was born on June 21, 1985, and my address is 123 Main Street.<p class=message>Alright, John, just a few more questions. Have you ever been arrested before?<p class="message sent">No, never.<p class=message>Good to know. And do you have any weapons or illegal substances on you?<p class="message sent">No, not at all. I'm just a simple juggler.<p class=message>Alright then, I think we have all we need for now. We will keep you informed on the progress of your case. Thank you for your cooperation.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Officer A. And if you need a juggling performance for the office party, just let me know!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=55ef1e65-4b54-41fd-9074-fbbc152cd03e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
