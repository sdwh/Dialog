The birds are singing, the flowers are blooming, and the sun is shining.<p class="message received message-content">Speaking of birds, did you know that the robin is the state bird of Michigan?<p class="message sent message-content">No, I didn't know that. Why is it the state bird?<p class="message received message-content">Well, apparently it's because they're one of the first birds to appear in spring, symbolizing the arrival of new life and hope.<p class="message sent message-content">That's really interesting, grandpa. Speaking of new life, have you seen any interesting animals in this park before?<p class="message received message-content">Oh yes, I've seen deer, squirrels, and even a groundhog once!<p class="message sent message-content">Wow! I hope we get to see something cool like that today.<p class="message received message-content">If we're lucky we just might! Hey, let's sit down on this bench and rest for a bit.<p class="message sent message-content">Okay. *Sits on bench* Oh look, there's a group of kids playing catch over there.<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, they seem to be having a great time. Do you like playing baseball or softball, grandson?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I do! I'm on the little league team at school.<p class="message received message-content">That's awesome. I used to play in my school days too, you know.<p class="message sent message-content">Really, grandpa? What position did you play?<p class="message received message-content">I was a catcher. It's a tough job, but someone's got to do it!<p class="message sent message-content">Haha, that's cool. Maybe one day we can play catch together.<p class="message received message-content">I'd love that, grandson. It's always great to spend time with family.<p class="message sent message-content">I agree, grandpa. Thanks for taking me on this walk in the park.<p class="message received message-content">Anytime, kiddo. Now let's continue our stroll and see if we can spot any wildlife!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0094eaf9-379d-4ed3-94e3-5885790beea1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
