I hope you slept well.<p class="message sent">Morning, officer. Well, I have to say, my bed could use an upgrade.<p class=message>I can imagine. The bed at the station isn't exactly a luxury one, but it does the job.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I guess it's better than nothing. But tell me, officer, how long do I have to stay here?<p class=message>We just need to ask you a few questions regarding the incident last night. After that, you'll be free to go.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's get it over with then. Fire away, officer.<p class=message>Can you explain why we found you hiding in the bushes with four pizza boxes and a guitar in your possession?<p class="message sent">Ah, that. Well, I was at a party and got carried away. I saw the pizza and thought it was a good idea to take them with me. And as for the guitar, I was just trying to impress a girl.<p class=message>I see. Well, stealing is not something we can take lightly, even if it's just pizza. And as for the guitar...well, the effort is commendable, but it's no excuse for breaking and entering.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I get it. I messed up. Can I apologize to the owners of the house and pay for the damages?<p class=message>That's a good start. We'll arrange a meeting with them later. But first, tell me - did you actually know how to play the guitar?<p class="message sent">*laughs* No, not really. That's why I was hoping the girl was just as drunk as I was.<p class=message>Well, at least you have a sense of humor about it. That's something. And by the way, you missed a spot on your shirt. Looks like a drop of pizza sauce there.<p class="message sent">*looks down* Damn it. And after I thought I had made a clean getaway.<p class=message>*chuckles* It's never as easy as it seems, is it? Now let's get to those questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cc3e6359-1802-4577-8763-79db01a66744.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
