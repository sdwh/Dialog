Are you a fisherman?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I am. And you are?<p class=message>I'm a marine biologist who works to protect marine environment and promote sustainable fishing. What kind of fish do you usually catch?<p class="message sent">Mostly tuna, swordfish, and shrimp.<p class=message>Those are popular targets for fishing. But have you considered the impact of your fishing practices on the marine ecosystem?<p class="message sent">Of course. Our boat is equipped with technologies to avoid catching unintended species, and we make sure to only catch what we need.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Have you heard of sustainable fishing practices like using selective gear or implementing closed seasons to avoid overfishing?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. But it's not always easy to do that in practice. Sometimes, we need to catch more fish to make ends meet.<p class=message>Yeah, I understand the challenges. But if we don't act now, we'll have more severe consequences in the future. Have you noticed any changes in the marine environment over the years?<p class="message sent">Definitely. There are fewer fish, and I've seen more dead whales and dolphins washed up on shore.<p class=message>That's very concerning. But there are ways to reverse the damage, such as implementing fishing quotas and creating marine protected areas.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's important for everyone to do their part in protecting the ocean, so future generations can still enjoy this valuable resource.<p class=message>Absolutely! Thank you for your time, and keep up the good work to make our ocean thrive again!<p class="message sent">My pleasure, and thanks for sharing your insights with me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cc5db4b9-582b-4c11-95d9-bff7a6e25ac4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
