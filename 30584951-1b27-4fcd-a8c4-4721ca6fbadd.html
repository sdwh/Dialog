Are you ready for another busy day at the snack shop here in Wanhua District?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, Chef A. I'm excited to see what customers we'll have today. How about you?<p class=message>Well, I'm ecstatic to prepare and serve some of the local delicacies, like braised pork leg noodles and pineapple cakes.<p class="message sent">Those are some of our best-sellers, Chef A. I'm sure they'll be a hit with our customers today.<p class=message>Speaking of our customers, have you noticed any new faces around the neighborhood lately?<p class="message sent">Come to think of it, yes. I've seen some tourists around here taking photos and trying out different food stalls. Why do you ask, Chef A?<p class=message>I was thinking of preparing some fusion dishes that cater to the tourists' taste buds. How about a pork belly burger with melted cheese and a tangy sauce, or chicken skewers with a spicy peanut sauce?<p class="message sent">Ooh, those sound like tasty ideas, Chef A. Let's add those to our specials today and see how they sell.<p class=message>Sure thing, Manager. I'll start whipping those up in the kitchen. Do we have enough supplies for the day?<p class="message sent">Yes, Chef A, I made sure to order enough ingredients so we won't run out. But just in case, let's keep an eye on the stock and order more as needed.<p class=message>Understood, Manager. By the way, have you tested the new soy sauce we ordered from the supplier in Taichung?<p class="message sent">Not yet, Chef A. Would you like to try it out with the noodles or pineapple cakes?<p class=message>I think both! Let's dip some noodles in it and drizzle the cakes with it. I'm excited to taste the difference.<p class="message sent">Me too, Chef A. Let's give it a go and see if it's a good addition to our pantry.<p class=message>Agreed, Manager. Let's get this cooking and serving going. Our customers are waiting for us!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=305811c0-5839-4b3c-b880-463552143dbd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
