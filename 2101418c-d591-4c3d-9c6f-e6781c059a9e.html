I heard we're working on designing an app for online booking and boarding for our airline.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. We need to make sure it's user-friendly and efficient.<p class=message>I completely agree. What features do you think we should include?<p class="message sent">Well, first and foremost, we need to have a clear and simple booking process. Customers should be able to easily select their destination and travel dates.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we should also incorporate features such as seat selection or meal preferences.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Additionally, we should have real-time flight updates and the ability to reschedule or cancel flights.<p class=message>Great ideas! What about for boarding? How can we make that process smoother?<p class="message sent">We could consider incorporating a QR code system for boarding passes or even a facial recognition system.<p class=message>Those are cool ideas! And we should also make sure the app features an intuitive navigation system for customers.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And we can't forget about security - implementing strong safeguards to protect customer information is paramount.<p class=message>Yes, of course. We want our customers to have peace of mind when using our app.<p class="message sent">Overall, we need to ensure that the app is fast, reliable, and user-friendly.<p class=message>Agreed. I'm looking forward to working on this project with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise! It's going to be an exciting challenge.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=20fda0f6-018b-4c1d-a068-64eb009115c4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
