I see you're enjoying the sunshine on the beach, B!<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, it's a perfect day to relax and soak up some vitamin sea. Speaking of which, have you thought about our music production plan?<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely! I've been working on some new melodies, and I believe we should incorporate some beachy vibes into our tracks.<p class="message sent message-content">Great idea! That will definitely resonate with our listeners. I'm thinking of adding some steelpan drums and a ukulele to the mix.<p class="message received message-content">I love it! And how about some seagull sounds in the background to add to the beach ambiance?<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, that sounds interesting. But we need to be careful not to overdo it. We don't want to sound like a relaxation tape.<p class="message received message-content">(laughs) You're right. So, how many songs do we want to include in this album?<p class="message sent message-content">I say we go for nine tracks. That's a good number for a standard album.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds good to me. Should we also think about featuring any guest artists?<p class="message sent message-content">I was thinking we could collaborate with a local reggae artist. I've got some connections.<p class="message received message-content">That's a great idea. Adding a different flavor to the album will make it more diverse. Do you think we'll have enough time to make this album before summer's over?<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely! We can start the recording process in a week or two, and then we'll mix and master the tracks. We'll be ready to release the album by the end of August.<p class="message received message-content">Awesome! I'm excited to start this project. I think our fans are going to love it.<p class="message sent message-content">Me too! Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0c4f0037-7784-4d22-b98d-cfe80752baae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
