I'm the baker assigned to teach you how to make Spanish pastries today. Are you guys excited?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! My sweet tooth has been excited for this day since we booked the tour.<p class=message>Haha, that's great to hear. Now, let's start with the classic churros. We'll need flour, butter, sugar, and milk.<p class="message sent">I didn't know churros have butter in them. I always thought they were just fried dough.<p class=message>Yes, the butter is what makes them crispy on the outside while still soft and fluffy on the inside.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. So, what's next?<p class=message>After mixing the ingredients, we'll pipe the dough into hot oil until they turn golden brown. Then, we'll dust them with cinnamon sugar.<p class="message sent">Yum! I can't wait to try them. What about the other pastries?<p class=message>We'll also make a delicious leche frita which is a dessert made of a custard-like filling coated in breadcrumbs and then fried.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. How long have you been a baker?<p class=message>I've been baking for about 10 years now. I started as an apprentice and then went on to study pastry-making.<p class="message sent">Wow, you must have tried lots of pastries from different parts of the world.<p class=message>Absolutely! But, I still think Spanish pastries are some of the best.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. By the way, can I take some of these treats home?<p class=message>Of course, we have a take-out box ready for you. Thank you for joining me in this workshop. I hope you had fun and learned a lot.<p class="message sent">We did. Thank you for sharing your expertise with us. We'll definitely come back for more!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=32dafa98-32e0-4b4f-aa28-1bd7e405c4b7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
