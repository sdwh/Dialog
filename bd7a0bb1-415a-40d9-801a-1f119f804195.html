As a software engineer, what do you think should be our first step?<p class="message sent">Hi A, yes, it's an exciting project indeed. I think our first step should be to gather relevant medical data to train our AI algorithms.<p class=message>Makes total sense. How about we use data from past medical records and diagnostic test results?<p class="message sent">Yes, that would be a good starting point. And we can also get data from medical research articles and clinical trials.<p class=message>Speaking of research articles, have you read that one where a machine learning algorithm diagnosed a rare disease that stumped human doctors?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's amazing how AI can analyze enormous amounts of data quickly and accurately.<p class=message>Absolutely, and I think our system can help doctors make more informed diagnoses and even speed up the overall diagnosis process.<p class="message sent">That's the idea! But we also need to make sure that the system is designed to protect patient privacy and conforms to all regulatory requirements.<p class=message>Of course, we'll do everything we can to ensure the system is secure and properly regulated.<p class="message sent">Great, let's get to work then. Do you have any ideas on the best software development methodology to use for this project?<p class=message>Agile development seems appropriate given that we'll likely have several iterations before we get this right.<p class="message sent">I totally agree with you, A. Can't wait to see the progress we'll make in the coming months.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bd78b6a9-1235-42f2-b39b-224650ad82e1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
