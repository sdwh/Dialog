Would you like to try our authentic Singaporean chicken rice for breakfast today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Sounds great, but I definitely need my soy milk fix first. What flavors do you have?<p class=message>We have traditional hot chicken broth and cold soy milk with red bean or grass jelly. Take your pick!<p class="message sent">I'll go with the cold soy milk with grass jelly, please. How would you describe your chicken rice?<p class=message>Our chicken rice is fragrant, moist and tender, with a hint of ginger and garlic. We use only the best quality rice and chicken meat.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! I’ll have the chicken rice too. Can you make it spicy?<p class=message>Absolutely! We have our homemade chili sauce that will add an extra kick to your meal.<p class="message sent">Perfect! Do you have any other popular dishes besides the chicken rice?<p class=message>Yes, we also have roasted pork and duck, as well as fried fish fillet. Everything is cooked fresh daily.<p class="message sent">Impressive! It’s hard to find authentic Singaporean food outside of Singapore. And what about your soy milk?<p class=message>We make our soy milk fresh every day, using only non-GMO soybeans. It’s rich in flavor and full of nutrients.<p class="message sent">That’s great to know. Do you have any meal deals?<p class=message>Yes, our breakfast combo includes a plate of chicken rice, a cup of soy milk and a boiled egg for only $5.<p class="message sent">Wow, that’s a steal! I’ll take the combo, please. Thank you!<p class=message>You’re welcome! Enjoy your breakfast, sir.<p class="message sent">I definitely will. And by the way, have you tried our signature "Tau Huay" (soy pudding) yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but it definitely looks tempting. Maybe I'll come try some after my shift!<p class="message sent">You're always welcome! We can trade some of our local delicacies for your delicious chicken rice.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Let’s do that. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You too! Take care.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=70b60b63-a160-4742-915d-203a092a6d81.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
