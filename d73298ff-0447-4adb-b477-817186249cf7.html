I need your help with something.<p class="message sent">Sure, what's up?<p class=message>We've been getting a flood of requests from our clients lately, and we're having trouble keeping up with the load. Any suggestions for how we can cope?<p class="message sent">Well, one approach could be to scale up our servers, but that can get expensive pretty quickly.<p class=message>Yeah, we're trying to keep costs down, so that's not ideal. How about caching frequently-requested data?<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. We could possibly cache the data on the client side, so we don't burden the server with too many requests.<p class=message>Another option we're considering is to prioritize the most important requests and process them first, while putting the less important requests on hold temporarily.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's called request throttling. We can configure the system to queue up requests and process them based on their priority levels.<p class=message>Great, that sounds like it could help. But what about when the server does get overwhelmed?<p class="message sent">In that case, we can set up a system to gracefully degrade the performance. For example, we might show a "loading" spinner or an error message to let the user know that their request is being processed, and prevent the server from getting overloaded.<p class=message>That's a fantastic idea! It would definitely help us avoid any catastrophic crashes.<p class="message sent">Speaking of crashes, we should also make sure to have a good error-handling system in place, so that we can diagnose and fix any issues that may arise.<p class=message>Absolutely, that's a crucial part of dealing with client requests. Thanks for your help, you really know your stuff.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. Let's work together to ensure our clients get the best experience possible!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d731e211-04d4-4bf3-8fee-4be2336238d7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
