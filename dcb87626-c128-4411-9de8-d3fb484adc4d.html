It could definitely add a unique twist to the game.<p class=message>I completely agree! Van cars come in all shapes and sizes, it would be interesting to see how a player could create their own custom look.<p class="message sent">And with van life becoming more popular, I think adding this feature to a game would attract a whole new audience.<p class=message>I'm picturing the game having options for color, pattern, window shape, and even interior design.<p class="message sent">Yes! And we could also include options for adding things to the roof, like a surfboard or a kayak.<p class=message>It would be great if the player could also choose the type of wheels and tires they want on their van.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, and let's not forget about the ability to add unique decals or graphics to the exterior.<p class=message>And the most fun part of it all would be taking your custom-designed van on virtual adventures.<p class="message sent">It definitely adds to the excitement of the game. I can already imagine players racing their custom vans on the virtual streets.<p class=message>The possibilities are endless. We should pitch this idea to a game developer and see what they think.<p class="message sent">Let's do it! I can't wait to see this game come to life.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dcb85e94-0ee8-444a-90cd-3d20682358af.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
