How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too. I'm doing well, thanks. How's the view up in the tower?<p class=message>It's a beautiful day, clear skies, and smooth traffic. Can't complain. Speaking of traffic, I have an Emirates flight 2225 inbound. Can we coordinate landing time?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Let me check the data. Looks like we have an opening in approximately 10 minutes. Will that work for you?<p class=message>That's perfect. Thank you. Oh, and how about the departing flight 4562? Can we move up their takeoff time?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, we have a bit of congestion on the runway at the moment, but we should clear up in about an hour. Would that be too late for them?<p class=message>That might cause a bit of a delay for passengers, but I think we can manage. Thanks for the heads up.<p class="message sent">No problem. Hey, I heard you guys had a pizza party up there last night. I'm a bit jealous.<p class=message>(chuckles) Yeah, our supervisor wanted to show appreciation for our hard work. It was a nice surprise.<p class="message sent">Well, send some of those leftovers down here, will ya? I could use a snack.<p class=message>(laughing) I'll see what I can do. Alright, Emirates 2225 is on final approach. Gotta run.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, Tower Ops. Thanks for checking in.<p class=message>No problem. Talk to you soon.<p class="message sent">Bye.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3fb1f7b6-e52a-4458-8b6b-fb056ccae84a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
