Have you been able to find everything you need?<p class="message sent">Almost everything. I'm looking for some chocolate covered almonds, but I can't seem to find them.<p class=message>Hmm, let me check our inventory. Oh no, it looks like we're out of stock. Would you like me to check if any of our other locations have them?<p class="message sent">Yes, that would be great. Thank you!<p class=message>No problem. While I look that up, is there anything else you're looking for?<p class="message sent">Actually, do you have any recommendations for similar treats?<p class=message>Of course! How about some dark chocolate covered cashews or milk chocolate covered hazelnuts?<p class="message sent">Ooh, those both sound delicious. I'll take a small bag of each, please.<p class=message>Awesome choice! And just to confirm, you still need me to check on the chocolate covered almonds?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. But if you can't find them, I'm happy with the alternatives.<p class=message>Will do. Hey, have you checked out our new bakery section yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, what do you recommend?<p class=message>The cinnamon rolls are to die for! And the croissants are so flaky and buttery.<p class="message sent">Mmm, I have a weakness for croissants. I'll definitely have to check that out.<p class=message>Trust me, you won't regret it. Also, if you can't find what you're looking for here, there's a couple other supermarkets down the street that might have it.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tip. I appreciate all your help today.<p class=message>No problem, it's my pleasure to assist you. Is there anything else I can help with before you check out?<p class="message sent">Nope, that's it for me. Thanks again!<p class=message>You're welcome! Have a great day and enjoy your treats.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6ed548ab-4ae4-4418-868a-7cfb7cc14d8d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
