This restaurant looks amazing!<p class="message sent">Yes, it's so cozy and romantic. Thank you for choosing it.<p class=message>Of course, I wanted to make tonight special. Have you decided what you'd like to eat?<p class="message sent">I think I'll go with the pasta dish. What about you?<p class=message>I'm eyeing the steak, it looks delicious. But first, let's order some wine to toast to us.<p class="message sent">Great idea! I'll let you pick out the bottle, since you're the expert.<p class=message>Ha! I don't know about that. But I'll see what the sommelier has to recommend.<p class="message sent">So, I was thinking, remember when we first met and you spilled coffee all over me?<p class=message>How could I forget? I was mortified.<p class="message sent">Well, it led to our first conversation, and now here we are, celebrating our anniversary.<p class=message>True. And I have to say, you still look just as beautiful as you did that day.<p class="message sent">Aw, thank you. And you're still as charming as ever.<p class=message>As long as I can still make you laugh, that's all that matters.<p class="message sent">You always do. That's why I love you.<p class=message>I love you too, more than anything in the world.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Oh, looks like our food is here. Let's dig in!<p class=message>Yes, let's. And here's to many more years of laughter and love together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=37ccd188-6d4e-44ba-b1db-32b0f4f6e0bc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
