How's the coffee business doing?<p class="message sent">Hey there, A! It's been pretty good. How about you? How are the beans coming along?<p class=message>Everything's going well. I'm actually trying a new recipe that I think would complement your coffee perfectly.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! I've been experimenting with some new blends too.<p class=message>Oh, really? What kind of coffee beans have you been using?<p class="message sent">I've been using beans from Brazil, Guatemala, and Colombia. They produce a nice balance of acidity and sweetness. How about you?<p class=message>I've got some beans from Ethiopia and Kenya that I think you'll really like. They're known for their fruity and floral notes.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting! I'll have to give those a try. Speaking of trying new things, have you tried adding any new pastries to your menu?<p class=message>Yes, I have! I made some lemon poppyseed muffins and carrot cake last week. They were a hit with my regular customers.<p class="message sent">Those sound delicious! Maybe we can do a collaboration one day and offer a coffee and pastry pairing.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We'll have to plan that out soon.<p class="message sent">Definitely. So, how much longer do the beans need to roast?<p class=message>They should be ready in about 10 minutes. Want to grab a cup of coffee while we wait?<p class="message sent">Sure, let's do it. Thanks, A!<p class=message>No problem, B! Always happy to chat over a cup of coffee.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1c74f8a4-0d3f-42a0-8874-27c774d3aae9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
