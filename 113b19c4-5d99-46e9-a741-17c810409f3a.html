What about physical security measures for the servers and data centers?<p class="message sent">We have restricted access to the servers, use CCTV cameras to monitor the data centers, and have fire suppression systems in place.<p class=message>Excellent.

It looks like you have covered all the bases when it comes to ISO 27001 compliance. I think we can wrap up the audit now.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A.
