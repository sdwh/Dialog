I'm the driver for this car. It looks like we've got a bit of a problem with the engine.<p class="message sent">Hey, no problem. I'm the mechanic for this team. Let's take a look.<p class=message>Great! I was worried we wouldn't be able to race today.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'll have you back on the track in no time.<p class=message>That's a relief. So, what do you think the issue is?<p class="message sent">Looks like a loose hose. I'll tighten it up and make sure there are no leaks.<p class=message>I don't want to slow down the team. Will we still be able to catch up?<p class="message sent">Of course! Just give it your all on the track and I'll make sure the car is in top shape.<p class=message>Thanks so much for your help. You really know what you're doing.<p class="message sent">Haha, I've been around cars for as long as I can remember. It's a passion of mine.<p class=message>I can tell you really enjoy your job. What's the most interesting problem you've had to solve?<p class="message sent">Oh, there've been a lot over the years. Once, a car came in with a family of mice living inside the engine!<p class=message>Really? That's wild! How did you deal with it?<p class="message sent">Well, I had to remove the engine and clean out all the debris. It was a unique challenge, that's for sure.<p class=message>I can only imagine. But I'm glad our issue today is a bit less...furry.<p class="message sent">Haha, same here. Alright, we're all set! Give it a test drive and let me know if anything else feels off.<p class=message>Will do. Thanks again for your help. Let's go win this race!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=018b5678-e3c0-4e04-a162-d62c76fc92d7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
