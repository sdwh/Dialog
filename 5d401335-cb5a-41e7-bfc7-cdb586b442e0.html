I'm headed to Canberra today. Can you take me there?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! It's about a 3-hour drive from here. Are you visiting for work or leisure?<p class=message>Actually, it's for leisure. I'm excited to check out all the museums and galleries.<p class="message sent">Oh, you'll love it then! I recommend checking out the National Museum and the National Portrait Gallery. Have you been to Canberra before?<p class=message>No, it's my first time. Do you have any other recommendations for places to visit?<p class="message sent">If you're into nature, you should definitely visit the Australian National Botanic Gardens. And don't forget to try some local cuisine - the meat pies are a must-try!<p class=message>Sounds great! Do you live in Canberra?<p class="message sent">No, I'm actually from Sydney. But I visit often for work. I always love coming here though - the city is so beautiful and peaceful.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I'm just glad to escape from the busy city life for a few days.<p class="message sent">I understand, it's always nice to take a break. Do you have any other travel plans while in Australia?<p class=message>Yes, I'm planning on visiting Melbourne next week. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, Melbourne is a fantastic city. Don't miss out on visiting the National Gallery of Victoria - they always have amazing exhibitions.<p class=message>I'll definitely add that to my list. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. We're almost there, by the way. Is there anything else you need before we arrive?<p class=message>No, I think I'm good. Thanks for the ride!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, enjoy your trip to Canberra!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5d400bf6-0fee-4166-adba-fb2c48e94516.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
