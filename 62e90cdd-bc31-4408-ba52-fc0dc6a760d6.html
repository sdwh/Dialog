How can I assist you today with student affairs?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I have some concerns about the upcoming graduation ceremony. Do you have a moment to discuss it?<p class=message>Of course, please tell me more about it.<p class="message sent">Well, I've noticed that some students might feel left out during the ceremony because of the limited number of tickets available to their families.<p class=message>I understand your concern. Have you considered setting up a live-streaming option for those unable to attend?<p class="message sent">Yes, but we’d still like to find a way to make the ceremony feel inclusive. Maybe we can have a photo booth or a special recognition for those who can't be there in person.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can even display their photos during the ceremony.<p class="message sent">Exactly! And maybe we can also organize an after-party for those who couldn't attend.<p class=message>I love it! I'll start working on the logistics right away. Anything else on your mind?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I’ve been noticing a lot of students skipping classes lately.<p class=message>That's unfortunate. Do you have any suggestions on how we could address this problem?<p class="message sent">Perhaps we could offer some incentives for attendance like extra credit or a reward system.<p class=message>That's a great idea. And we could also send reminders to students before each class.<p class="message sent">Yes, that would definitely help! Thank you for your help, A.<p class=message>You're welcome, Professor B. And if you have any more concerns, feel free to come to me anytime.<p class="message sent">I appreciate it, A. Have a great day!<p class=message>You too, Professor B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=62e4f927-1b31-4aeb-bbd4-da85d64f509c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
