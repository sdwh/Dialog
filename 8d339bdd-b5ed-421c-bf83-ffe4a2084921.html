I'm not surprised though, everyone loves our brisket and ribs. Speaking of which, I just placed an order for a full rack of ribs and two pounds of brisket.<p class=message>You got it. Our meats are smoked to perfection for hours with a blend of mesquite and oak wood. It gives it that authentic Texas flavor.<p class="message sent">That's exactly why people keep coming back for more. Plus, our sides are just as good. I recommend pairing the meats with our mac and cheese and coleslaw.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Our mac and cheese has a secret ingredient that sets it apart from others, and our coleslaw is made fresh every day.<p class="message sent">Yum, sounds delicious. Oh, and don't forget about our homemade BBQ sauce. It's tangy and sweet, perfect for dipping the meats.<p class=message>Definitely. We use our own blend of spices in the sauce that gives it a unique taste. It's also available for purchase if our customers want to take some home.<p class="message sent">That's great to know. Our customers are always asking for the recipe. Speaking of customers, we've got a big group coming in for dinner tonight. Do you have any recommendations for them?<p class=message>For a group, I'd suggest getting our meat platter which includes brisket, sausage, chicken, and ribs. It's a great way to try everything we offer. And for sides, you can't go wrong with our baked beans and potato salad.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. I'll let them know. Thanks for the recommendations. You really are the BBQ master, A.<p class=message>You're welcome, B. It's always a pleasure working with you. Now let's get back to cooking up a storm.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8d328211-c9ab-4e82-b550-922cc20ad250.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
