My name is Alex and I am a travel consultant for this group. We're looking to rent a car for our road trip in Melbourne.<p class="message sent">Hi Alex! My name is Ben and I'm a rental agent here. Great to hear you're planning a road trip. How many people are in your group?<p class=message>There are four of us - myself, my wife, and two friends. We're really excited to explore the Great Ocean Road.<p class="message sent">That's a popular route, and you'll definitely need a vehicle with sufficient storage space. Based on the number of travellers and luggage, I would suggest a SUV.<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea. Any recommendations?<p class="message sent">We have a range of SUVs, but the Toyota RAV4 is very popular due to its fuel efficiency and versatility. It's spacious enough to accommodate your group and luggage while being comfortable to drive.<p class=message>Perfect! We'll take the Toyota RAV4. Also, do you have any suggestions for places to visit on our road trip?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. The Great Ocean Road is a scenic coastal drive, and I would recommend stopping at the twelve apostles, Port Campbell National Park, and the Loch Ard Gorge.<p class=message>Oh, we've heard about the twelve apostles. Can you tell us more about it?<p class="message sent">The twelve apostles is a group of limestone stacks off the shore of the Port Campbell National Park. It's a spectacular natural sight that attracts many visitors.<p class=message>Sounds amazing. We'll definitely add that to our itinerary. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class="message sent">You could also visit Lorne, a beautiful seaside town with great restaurants and cafes. And if you're interested in wildlife, the Great Otway National Park is home to koalas and other Australian animals.<p class=message>Excellent suggestions. Thank you so much for your help, Ben.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, Alex. Enjoy your road trip and safe travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=88f6a618-dceb-4e15-a50d-ba5c82739623.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
