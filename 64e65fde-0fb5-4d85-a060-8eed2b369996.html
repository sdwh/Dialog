How was your day?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! It was great, another busy day at the restaurant. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. Always something to do in the kitchen. But it's worth it to see our customers enjoying their meal.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of meals, have you tried the new dish our chef created?<p class=message>Which one is that?<p class="message sent">It's our new duck confit with a cherry sauce. It's been getting rave reviews from our customers.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I'll have to try it tonight. And what wine do you recommend to pair with it?<p class="message sent">For that dish, I suggest a Pinot Noir from Burgundy. We have a great selection from the region.<p class=message>Perfect. I trust your recommendations when it comes to wine. What's new with our wine list, by the way?<p class="message sent">We just added some new wines from Loire Valley. They're a bit lesser-known, but still high-quality and affordable.<p class=message>Excellent. I'll make sure to try those out as well.<p class="message sent">How's our attendance lately?<p class=message>It's been steady, but we're always looking for ways to attract more customers. Our location in the Old Town definitely helps, though.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a great selling point for tourists who want to experience the authentic French cuisine and atmosphere.<p class=message>Speaking of tourists, have you noticed any language barriers with our international customers?<p class="message sent">A bit, but I always try to make them feel welcome and help them navigate the menu. It's important to make them feel comfortable and appreciated.<p class=message>That's true. I've noticed you're very good with languages. How many languages do you speak?<p class="message sent">Thank you! I speak English, French, Spanish, and Italian fluently, and a bit of German and Portuguese.<p class=message>Impressive! You're definitely an asset to our team.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It's a pleasure working with such a great team and providing our customers with the best dining experience possible.<p class=message>Agreed. And with that, let's get back to work and show our customers what we're made of!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=64e54db2-4667-42b1-bde2-48785e81eab8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
