But thankfully, we have a great team of rescuers here at the coast guard base to help us out.<p class=message>Yeah, I'm grateful for that too. But it never hurts to be prepared, you know?<p class="message sent">Definitely. One thing I always do before setting sail is to check the weather forecast and make sure we have enough emergency supplies onboard.<p class=message>That's a good idea. I always make sure our life jackets are in good condition and easily accessible in case anything happens.<p class="message sent">Another thing we can do is to practice emergency drills and make sure everyone onboard knows what to do in case of an emergency.<p class=message>Agreed. And I think it's important to stay calm and level-headed in those situations, it can make a big difference.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's important to trust and communicate with our team as well, we are all in this together.<p class=message>You're right. And let's not forget to keep a positive attitude too, sometimes that can help keep everyone's spirits up in a tough situation.<p class="message sent">Exactly, we don't want to lose hope or give up. We need to keep fighting until help arrives.<p class=message>Well said B, I feel better knowing we have a plan in place and are ready for any potential disasters.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=77080fcf-05eb-4f91-bf38-103090f9ddc7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
