What kind of food can we expect?<p class="message received message-content">Everything from barbecue to seafood to desserts. It's a foodie's dream come true!<p class="message sent message-content">Oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. When is it happening?<p class="message received message-content">It's happening next month. We should plan a trip and go check it out!<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely! But are you sure we can handle all that food?<p class="message received message-content">Of course! We'll just have to pace ourselves and try a little bit of everything.<p class="message sent message-content">Challenge accepted! Do you have any particular dishes you're excited to try?<p class="message received message-content">Definitely the kangaroo skewers and the pavlova. I've heard they're a must-try.<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, I'm more interested in trying some exotic seafood like barramundi or even crocodile. Yum!<p class="message received message-content">Sounds risky, but I'm down to try new things. We may even discover a new favorite dish!<p class="message sent message-content">That's the spirit! I can't wait to see what else they have to offer. Maybe we can even try some local wine or beer to wash it all down.<p class="message received message-content">Yes, I heard they have a great selection of local drinks too. This is going to be one delicious adventure!<p class="message sent message-content">Agreed. Let's start planning our trip now and make sure we don't miss out on any of the food festival fun.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=06111149-094b-4cc9-a9b3-f0b26a77a3e4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
