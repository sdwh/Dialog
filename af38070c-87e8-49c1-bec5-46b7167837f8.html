How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! I'm doing great. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks for asking. Did you have a good weekend?<p class="message sent">Yes, it was quite relaxing. I also did some experimentation with a new recipe for our cake of the month.<p class=message>Sounds interesting! What flavor did you come up with this time?<p class="message sent">It's a mix of vanilla and raspberry, with a touch of lemon. It's light and refreshing, perfect for the warmer weather.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'm sure our customers will love it.<p class="message sent">Speaking of customers, have you noticed any new faces in the caf√© lately?<p class=message>Yes, actually. We've been getting quite a few tourists stopping by to try our handcrafted coffee and cakes.<p class="message sent">That's great news. Maybe we should consider expanding our menu to include some international flavors.<p class=message>That's a great idea. We could try out some Japanese-inspired desserts or even some French pastries.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. We'll have to hit the kitchen soon and do some experimenting.<p class=message>I'm excited already. I'm sure we'll come up with something amazing together.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's always fun collaborating with you, A.<p class=message>Same here, B. We make a great team!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=af36878d-caff-46d6-a7b1-c2f7d93d112a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
