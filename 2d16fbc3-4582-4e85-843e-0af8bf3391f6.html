This fish market is teeming with so many varieties of fish. What do you suggest we get for our cooking lesson today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Since we're in Nagasaki, I suggest we try making their famous seafood broth. We'll need some sardines, squid, and clams for that.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Can you give me some tips on how to choose the right seafood for our soup?<p class="message sent">Sure, A. Look for fish with bright eyes and shiny skin, and make sure they don't smell too fishy. And for clams, make sure they're tightly closed.<p class=message>Got it! I'll follow your lead. Now, let's go haggle for some good deals with the vendors.<p class="message sent">Great idea, A! Watch me in action.<p class=message>Okay, what's next? How do we make the soup?<p class="message sent">First, we saut√© some garlic and onions in a pot. Then, we add the seafood and some veggies like carrots and mushrooms. After that, we pour in some water and let it simmer for a while.<p class=message>Mm, that smells delicious already! What's the secret to making a great seafood broth?<p class="message sent">The secret lies in the quality of the seafood, A. And don't forget to season it well with some salt and pepper.<p class=message>You're a great teacher, B. I feel like a pro already!<p class="message sent">That's because cooking is all about confidence, A. Now, let's taste our creation.<p class=message>Oh my goodness, this is amazing! I never thought I could make something this delicious. Thank you so much, B!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A.
