How was the check-up at the clinic?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It was actually pretty good. The doctor was very thorough.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Did you get any shots or take any medicine?<p class="message sent">Nah, just some routine tests. But the doctor did give me some good advice on maintaining a healthy lifestyle.<p class=message>Nice! I bet you were a model patient.<p class="message sent">Ha! Not quite, I did get a little squeamish when they drew blood.<p class=message>Oh no! Did you look away or watch?<p class="message sent">I tried to distract myself by staring at the ceiling tiles, but it didn't really work.<p class=message>Well, it happens to the best of us. I once fainted during a flu shot.<p class="message sent">Ha! That's hilarious. I'm sure the nurse was surprised.<p class=message>Yeah, she definitely was. But don't worry, you'll definitely be more brave next time.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And who knows, maybe next time I'll be the one giving shots.<p class=message>Ha! You never know, stranger things have happened. All I know is that you'll make an excellent doctor someday.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! You never know, maybe I'll start my own clinic one day.<p class=message>That would be amazing! And I'll be your first patient.<p class="message sent">Deal! I'll make sure to give you a lollipop after every appointment.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=582cd2bc-670d-433e-8420-9fd9b05044d9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
