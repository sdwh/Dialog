Does it have any benefits?<p class=message>Definitely! It can help increase customer confidence and reduce security incidents.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. Can you tell me more about it?<p class=message>Sure! It involves a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information through processes and controls.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of work.<p class=message>It is, but it's worth it for the peace of mind it brings.<p class="message sent">I imagine it also involves training employees on best security practices?<p class=message>Yes, that's a key part of it. And it also involves ongoing audits and risk assessments.<p class="message sent">Wow, there's a lot more to it than I thought.<p class=message>But it's all for good reason. The consequences of a security breach can be disastrous for a company.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I can only imagine. Have you worked on implementing this standard before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It was a lot of work but very rewarding in the end.<p class="message sent">I can see why. It's great to know that companies take security seriously.<p class=message>Definitely. It gives customers peace of mind and shows that the company values their privacy.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. It's important to invest time and resources into protecting data.<p class=message>And ISO 27001 provides a framework to do just that!<p class="message sent">Thanks for sharing your knowledge with me, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B. It's always great to discuss important topics like this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=da978b6a-cee2-466d-966a-2242cf3e4b72.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
