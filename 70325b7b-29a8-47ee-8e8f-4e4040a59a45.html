How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, excited to visit Istanbul for the first time.<p class="message sent">Awesome! It's a beautiful city. Have you made any plans for your trip?<p class=message>Yeah, I want to visit Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Those are great choices. Don't forget to visit the Grand Bazaar for some shopping and try Turkish kebab.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! Speaking of food, what's your favorite Turkish dish?<p class="message sent">I love Turkish pide, it's like a pizza with different toppings. What about you?<p class=message>I've heard a lot about Turkish coffee, so I want to try that.<p class="message sent">That's a good choice. Turkish coffee is strong and comes with a small cup full of surprises.<p class=message>Surprises? What kind?<p class="message sent">You'll have to wait and see. It's part of the experience.<p class=message>Sounds exciting! How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for about 10 years now. It's a solid job that allows me to meet new people and learn about their culture.<p class=message>That's great. Do you have any advice for a first-time visitor like me?<p class="message sent">Be prepared to walk a lot and bring comfortable shoes. Also, always carry cash because not all places accept credit cards.<p class=message>Good to know. Thanks for the tips.<p class="message sent">No problem. We're almost there, enjoy your trip!<p class=message>Thank you so much for the ride and the wonderful conversation. It was a pleasure to meet you.<p class="message sent">Likewise.
