What's the book about?<p class=message>It's a book of spells, and it's said to have the power to turn anyone into a giant.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds interesting. But where can we find it?<p class=message>It's said to be hidden in a cave near the mountain. We need to go there and find it.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's go. But do you think we can handle the dangers inside the cave?<p class=message>Of course we can, I'm a magician, and you're a warrior. Together, we're an unstoppable team.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's get going. But wait, what if the book is cursed?<p class=message>Don't worry, I'll take care of it. I have the power to break curses.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's hope for the best. But, what if we get lost in the cave?<p class=message>Don't worry. I have a magic lamp that can guide us through the dark.<p class="message sent">That sounds useful. But what if we get attacked by monsters?<p class=message>Leave that to me, I have a few spells that can make them disappear in seconds.<p class="message sent">Good to hear that. But wait, we haven't even talked about how we'll split the treasure?<p class=message>Oh, don't worry. We'll decide that after we find the book.<p class="message sent">Alright then, let's go find that book and become giants.<p class=message>Yes, let's do this. I have a good feeling that we will find the book and become giants.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=69e990df-55e7-4a16-bfe8-1b7ce226bdc6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
