Are we all set for tonight's dinner service?<p class="message sent">Hi A! Yes, everything's ready. We've got a full house tonight.<p class=message>Great to hear! I'm excited to prepare tonight's specials. What's on the menu?<p class="message sent">We're featuring a delicious garlic butter steak and a creamy mushroom risotto.<p class=message>Yum, those sound amazing! Is there anything specific I should keep in mind while cooking?<p class="message sent">For the steak, make sure it's cooked medium rare and the garlic butter is evenly distributed. And for the risotto, be sure to stir constantly and add the broth gradually.<p class=message>Got it, thanks for the tips! Have we received any special requests or allergies from our customers?<p class="message sent">Actually, one of our diners is allergic to seafood. So, make sure to keep that in mind while cooking.<p class=message>Thanks for letting me know. I'll make sure to keep it separate and avoid any cross-contamination.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. By the way, have you heard about the new dessert that the chef down the street has been serving?<p class=message>No, what is it?<p class="message sent">It's a deep-fried ice cream topped with caramel sauce and whipped cream. Doesn't that sound amazing?<p class=message>Oh my god, that sounds incredible. I might have to sneak out after service to try that!<p class="message sent">Haha, I wouldn't blame you! Alright, let's get back to work. We've got hungry customers waiting.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aa79cf5f-563d-4710-94b3-54a04712e0ce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
