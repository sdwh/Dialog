How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great. The weather is perfect for some hot tea and steamed dumplings.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. Speaking of which, have you tried the new red bean paste buns we made yesterday?<p class=message>No, not yet. How are they?<p class="message sent">They're delicious! The filling is sweet and creamy, and the bun is soft and fluffy.<p class=message>Sounds amazing. I can't wait to try one.<p class="message sent">I'll bring some over to your shop later today. By the way, how's business been?<p class=message>It's been pretty steady. Lots of tourists coming in to try our authentic Hong Kong-style dim sum.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. We've been getting a lot of positive reviews for our mango sago and egg tarts.<p class=message>Yes, they're definitely crowd favorites. By the way, have you thought about making any new desserts?<p class="message sent">Yes, I was thinking of trying to make a durian pancake. Have you ever had one before?<p class=message>No, but I've heard they're an acquired taste. Still, I'm excited to try it and see how it turns out.<p class="message sent">I'll make a few batches and we can see how it goes. It might be a hit with the durian lovers out there.<p class=message>For sure. And who knows, maybe it'll convert some durian skeptics too.<p class="message sent">You never know. That's the fun of being in the food business - you get to experiment and try new things.<p class=message>Absolutely. Speaking of which, I have some ideas for some new dumpling fillings. Maybe we could collaborate and come up with something unique.<p class="message sent">I love that idea! Let's get together and brainstorm later this week.<p class=message>Sounds good. And let me know when those red bean paste buns are ready. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.<p class="message sent">Will do, A. See you later!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5cf6a0c-7fdf-4675-9d27-b7ff23e0870e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
