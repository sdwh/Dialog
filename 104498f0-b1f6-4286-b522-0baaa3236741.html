I love coming to this restaurant to create new drinks for our customers.<p class=message>That's awesome. I always love seeing what new drinks you come up with. Speaking of, any new creations lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I just made a beer sangria with fresh fruit that is really refreshing on a hot day. Want me to make you one?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds great. While you make that, I'll get the grill fired up and start cooking some meats. What do you think would pair well with that sangria?<p class="message sent">I think some grilled shrimp and spicy chorizo would be perfect with the fruit flavors in the sangria. What do you think?<p class=message>Sounds perfect. I'll get right on it. So, have you tried any good food lately?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I went to a new sushi place the other night and had the most amazing spicy tuna roll. It was so fresh and flavorful.<p class=message>I'm not a big fan of raw fish, but maybe you could convince me to try it someday. How about we make a deal? I'll try your sushi if you try my grilled lamb chops.<p class="message sent">You're on! I've actually been looking for a new meat to experiment with in my drinks.<p class=message>Oh yeah? Well, I've got some lamb chops marinated with rosemary and garlic that'll knock your socks off. Can't wait for you to try it.<p class="message sent">I'm looking forward to it! And here's your beer sangria. Let me know if it needs anything else.<p class=message>Wow, this is amazing! The fruit flavors are just perfect with the beer. I'm definitely going to recommend this to our customers.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it. Thanks for being my drink guinea pig!<p class=message>Hey, anytime. And speaking of guinea pigs, have you seen the little critters they have in the petting zoo outside? They're so cute!<p class="message sent">Oh my gosh, I haven't! Maybe after this rush, we could take a little break and go check them out.<p class=message>That sounds like the perfect way to end the evening. Let's get cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=10417f6c-2c4c-4625-b37d-5b4ec803ebfd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
