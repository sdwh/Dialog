How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks for asking. Just headed to Boston for a quick weekend trip. Have you always driven a taxi?<p class="message sent">Actually, I used to be an engineer. But driving a taxi has been a great way to meet interesting people and see different parts of the city.<p class=message>That's cool. What's the craziest thing that's ever happened to you on the job?<p class="message sent">One time I had a passenger who left their pet snake in the taxi! It was definitely a unique experience.<p class=message>Oh wow, that must have been quite a surprise. Do you have any favorite spots in Boston that you would recommend?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! If you love seafood, you should check out Legal Sea Foods. And if you're up for a little history, the Freedom Trail is a great way to see the city.<p class=message>Thank you for the recommendations. I'm definitely going to try them out. Have you always lived in Boston?<p class="message sent">Yes, born and raised. It's a great city with so much to offer.<p class=message>I agree. I've visited a few times before and I always enjoy my time here. Do you have any favorite hobbies outside of driving?<p class="message sent">I love playing basketball and spending time with my family. How about you?<p class=message>I enjoy reading, exploring new places, and trying new restaurants.<p class="message sent">Those all sound like great hobbies. Do you have any favorite books or restaurants in particular?<p class=message>I recently read "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho and I loved it. And as for restaurants, I had an amazing meal at a place called Oleana in Cambridge.<p class="message sent">I've heard great things about Oleana. Maybe I'll have to check it out myself. We're almost to your destination, but it was really nice chatting with you.<p class=message>Same to you. Thank you for the ride and the great conversation!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6f09d099-a498-4e5f-ad41-932ea4a90c12.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
