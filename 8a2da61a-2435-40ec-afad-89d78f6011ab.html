How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. So, let's talk about the project. How's everything going on your end?<p class="message sent">I'm making progress on my tasks, but I could use a bit more time to finish up.<p class=message>Yeah, I hear you. We've got a tight deadline, but we'll make it work. Have you talked to the other developers?<p class="message sent">I spoke with C earlier and he's making good headway as well. We might need to coordinate some of our work though.<p class=message>Definitely. Let's set up a meeting tomorrow to go over everything and make sure we're all on the same page.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Hey, have you tried that new restaurant down the street yet?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Have you?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I went there last night. The food was amazing. You should give it a try.<p class=message>I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation. Have you got any weekend plans?<p class="message sent">Not really, just planning on relaxing and maybe catching up on some reading. What about you?<p class=message>I'm going to a friend's housewarming party on Saturday, but other than that, no plans.<p class="message sent">Sounds like fun. Well, I better get back to work. Talk to you later.<p class=message>See you later.
