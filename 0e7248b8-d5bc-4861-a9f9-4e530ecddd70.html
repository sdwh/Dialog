What's up?<p class="message sent">Not much, A. Just dealing with some vulnerabilities our latest scan found.<p class=message>Ooh, that's never good news. What kind of vulnerabilities are we talking about here?<p class="message sent">Just some outdated software components, weak password policies, and a few XSS vulnerabilities.<p class=message>Ah, the usual suspects. How long do you think it'll take to patch everything up?<p class="message sent">Probably a couple of days at least. It's always a challenge to balance security and usability.<p class=message>Ain't that the truth. But hey, at least we're not dealing with a full-blown exploit or something.<p class="message sent">True, true. Thank goodness for small blessings.<p class=message>And speaking of blessings, have you ever heard of that church where the pastor encourages his congregation to use "password123" as their password?<p class="message sent">Ha! No way. That's ridiculous.<p class=message>Yeah, but apparently he thinks it's easier to remember than a complex password.<p class="message sent">I don't even know what to say to that. It's like leaving your car keys in the ignition with a "free car" sign on your windshield.<p class=message>Exactly! It's mind-boggling how some people just don't take security seriously.<p class="message sent">Well, I'm just glad we're not like that. Let's get to work on those fixes!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0e70d2a0-c86d-421d-8acf-bfcfa1529b5e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
