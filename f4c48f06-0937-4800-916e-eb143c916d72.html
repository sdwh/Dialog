Are you interested in learning about OWASP TOP 10 web application security risks?<p class="message sent">Hello! Yes, I am. It's been on my list of things to learn about for a while.<p class=message>Great! The best way to start is by understanding the top 10 risks, like injection attacks and cross-site scripting.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. So where do I go to learn more about these risks?<p class=message>OWASP.org is a great place to start. They have a lot of resources, including a detailed cheat sheet to help you understand each risk.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. But I have to admit, this all sounds pretty technical. Will I be able to understand everything?<p class=message>Absolutely! It's not as complicated as it may seem at first. Plus, you can always reach out to me for help if you get stuck.<p class="message sent">That's reassuring. Can you recommend any additional resources for me?<p class=message>Sure! "Breaking Web Software" by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto is a great book that covers the security risks in-depth.<p class="message sent">Awesome, thanks for the recommendation. And how long do you think it will take me to learn about all of these risks?<p class=message>It depends on how much time you dedicate to it, but I would say a couple of weeks or so should suffice.<p class="message sent">Sounds manageable. I'm excited to dig in and start learning.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Just remember to take it one step at a time and don't get overwhelmed.<p class="message sent">I won't. Thanks again for your help, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B. And feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want some more guidance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f4bfb090-e870-49c7-8ac9-1022103ea497.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
