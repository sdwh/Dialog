What's it about?<p class="message sent">Hello, thank you for coming. Tonight's opera is about a love triangle between a king, a queen, and a commoner.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds intriguing. Do you play one of the lead roles?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am playing the queen. It's quite a challenging role, but it's also a lot of fun.<p class=message>I bet it is. How long have you been performing in operas like this?<p class="message sent">I've been performing for over 10 years now. I started out in smaller productions, but I'm grateful to be able to perform in bigger productions like this one.<p class=message>You must have a great voice. Have you always known that you wanted to be a performer?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been singing since I was a child and fell in love with opera when I first saw one at the age of 12.<p class=message>That's amazing. It takes a lot of dedication and hard work to become a great performer like you.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I do my best. What do you think of the set design and costumes?<p class=message>They look magnificent! I'm especially impressed with the attention to detail in the queen's gown.<p class="message sent">Yes, the designer did an excellent job. It really helps to bring the story to life.<p class=message>I can't wait to see the story unfold on stage. Do you have any pre-performance rituals?<p class="message sent">Yes, I like to do some vocal warm-ups and take a moment to center myself. It helps me get into character and stay focused.<p class=message>That's great advice. I'm sure many aspiring performers can learn from you. Thank you for taking the time to talk to me.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. I hope you enjoy the show!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1ce1ea98-5e03-456e-8809-e459e9370268.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
