How's your day going?<p class="message sent">Hi there! It's going pretty well so far. How about yours?<p class=message>It's been good, thank you. So, how long have you been driving taxis?<p class="message sent">Oh, I've been doing it for about 10 years now. It's a job I really enjoy.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Have any interesting stories to share?<p class="message sent">Ha, I could tell you a few! One time, a customer left a full pizza in my car. Another time, a passenger fell asleep and snored so loudly that I almost couldn't hear the radio.<p class=message>Haha, those are pretty funny. Speaking of music, do you have a favorite genre to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I like to keep it varied. Sometimes I listen to classic rock, and other days it's jazz or even classical music.<p class=message>That's nice! I can imagine it makes the job more pleasant. I'm actually on my way to London for a culinary tour. Any restaurant recommendations?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely try out Dishoom for some delicious Indian food. And if you want to try something a bit different, head to Sketch for some unique afternoon tea.<p class=message>Sounds amazing, thanks for the recommendations. One last question - have you ever driven any celebrities around?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually! One time I drove around a well-known soccer player, and another time I picked up a comedian.<p class=message>Woah, that's really cool. Thank you so much for the ride and chat. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, enjoy your culinary tour!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ede1fe49-1281-4b82-95b7-9e3f7dbce214.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
