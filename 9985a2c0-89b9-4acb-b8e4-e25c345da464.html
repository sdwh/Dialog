I always feel like I'm on a nature walk with all these trees around us.<p class=message>Haha, well let's hope we don't run into any bears then.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'll make sure to use my good old flashlight to scare them off.<p class=message>Hey, speaking of flashlights, have you ever tried using Morse code with them?<p class="message sent">Nope, can't say that I have. Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I learned it in training and sometimes it's fun to communicate with other officers like that.<p class="message sent">That does sound interesting. Can you teach me?<p class=message>Sure, let's start with SOS: three quick flashes, three long flashes, and three quick flashes again.<p class="message sent">Got it. How about we try it out with those kids over there and see if they can figure it out?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Let's do it silently and see if they catch on.<p class="message sent">*flashes Morse code message with his flashlight*<p class=message>Look, they're doing it too! I think we have some future officers in the making.<p class="message sent">Haha, you never know. Maybe they'll be teaching us some new tricks in the future.<p class=message>Hey, speaking of tricks, did you catch that street performer earlier? He was quite impressive.<p class="message sent">Yeah, he was doing some crazy juggling moves. I don't even know how he didn't drop those knives.<p class=message>And did you see his fire-eating act? I thought my heart was going to stop.<p class="message sent">Honestly, I was too scared to look. Maybe we should stick to our day jobs.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Let's keep patrolling and ensure the safety of our community.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9984aa00-8e41-43c4-a599-240b7c5bbdaf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
