How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Hi Doctor A! It was great! I finally had some time to catch up on my sleep.<p class=message>Well, that's good to hear. We wouldn't want our patients to mistake you for a sleepwalker.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Definitely not, Doctor A. Speaking of patients, how has the clinic been today?<p class=message>Busy, as usual. I had to perform a tonsillectomy on a teenager this morning. Hopefully, he'll enjoy all the ice cream he can eat during his recovery.<p class="message sent">(smirks) You're just jealous that you can't eat that much ice cream without getting a brain freeze, Doctor A.<p class=message>(grinning) You might be right, Nurse B. But hey, let's focus on our next patient. I hear she's a big fan of crossword puzzles.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds like fun. Maybe you can challenge her to a crossword race.<p class=message>(chuckles) I think I'll let her win this time. I don't want her to think I'm a sore loser.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Good call, Doctor A. The last thing we need is a disgruntled crossword enthusiast on our hands.<p class=message>(smiling) Agreed. But jokes aside, let's make sure we give all our patients the best care possible.<p class="message sent">(nodding) Absolutely, Doctor A. They come to us for help, and it's our job to provide that help with compassion and professionalism.<p class=message>(smiling) You couldn't have said it better, Nurse B. Now, let's go make a difference in someone's life today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=35bca98b-f670-4208-ad3e-5905264f6230.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
