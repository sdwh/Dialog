How can I assist you with your case?<p class="message sent">Hi A, thanks for seeing me. I have some concerns regarding my recent traffic violation.<p class=message>Sure, let's take a look. Was it a major violation, like speeding or running a red light?<p class="message sent">It was just a failure to signal when changing lanes. I didn't think it was a big deal at the time.<p class=message>Hmm, well any violation can add up and affect your driving record. But don't worry, we can work on getting it reduced or dismissed.<p class="message sent">That would be great. I don't want my insurance rates to go up.<p class=message>I understand, and we'll do our best to avoid that. So, have you heard about the new self-driving cars that are being developed?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They sound interesting, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to trust a computer with my life yet.<p class=message>Haha, I can understand your hesitation. But statistically, self-driving cars are safer than human-driven cars.<p class="message sent">Really? I'll have to look into that.<p class=message>Yes, and they also have the potential to greatly reduce traffic and commute time. Maybe one day we won't even need to worry about traffic violations!<p class="message sent">That would be a dream come true. But for now, I'm just hoping to get this one resolved. Thanks for your help, A.<p class=message>Of course. Let's get started on your case and see what we can do to help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cd602ed7-5fb2-4f42-9846-f6aa5abcd9ec.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
