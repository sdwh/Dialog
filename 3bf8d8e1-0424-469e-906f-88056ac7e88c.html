I can see you're creating some delicious rice balls over there.<p class="message sent">Hey, thanks! And I see you're slicing up some beautiful sushi rolls too.<p class=message>Yep, it's always satisfying to see the colors and textures come together. What's your secret for making perfect rice balls?<p class="message sent">Well, I always make sure to season the rice well with vinegar and salt. And of course, having a good filling helps too.<p class=message>Agreed. Our customers love traditional fillings like salmon and pickled plum, but they also enjoy some creative twists.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I've experimented with fillings like teriyaki chicken and even a spicy tuna mix.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! You know, sushi and rice balls are always a hit, but have you tried making other Japanese dishes?<p class="message sent">Sure have! I love making tempura vegetables and udon noodle soups. What about you?<p class=message>Oh, I absolutely love making miso soup with tofu and seaweed. It's a comfort food that reminds me of home.<p class="message sent">That's great. It's always nice to have a dish that brings back fond memories.<p class=message>Exactly. And speaking of memories, have you tried any new restaurants in the area lately?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I tried this new ramen place down the street last week. It was fantastic.<p class=message>Ooh, I haven't tried it yet. I'll have to check it out. Do they have any specialty flavors?<p class="message sent">They do! I had a bowl of miso ramen with black garlic oil. It was next-level.<p class=message>Wow, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">Of course! And speaking of recommendations, have you tried that new tea shop on Main Street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What kind of teas do they have?<p class="message sent">They have a huge selection of green teas, matcha, and even some fruity blends. Their iced peach tea is really refreshing.<p class=message>Sounds perfect for this warm weather. I'll have to grab a cup after work today.<p class="message sent">Excellent idea. Well, I should get back to making some more rice balls. It was great chatting with you!<p class=message>Same to you. Good luck with your dishes!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3bf6f63b-398a-46cf-8d2e-cc718b96e2ec.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
