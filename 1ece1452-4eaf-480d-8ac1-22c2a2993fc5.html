What can I help you with today?<p class="message sent">Hi Juan, my name is Maria. I am a cook, and I am looking for some fresh and delicious ingredients for a traditional Spanish dish.<p class=message>Oh great! You have come to the right place. We have some of the finest produce around here. What kind of dish are you making?<p class="message sent">I am thinking of making Paella. What do you recommend for the ingredients?<p class=message>For seafood, we have some fresh prawns, mussels and squid that would be perfect. Also, tomatoes, bell peppers and onions would be great for the base.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! Do you have any specialty spices I could use?<p class=message>Yes, we have a great blend of saffron, paprika, and garlic, which will give your Paella that perfect Spanish flavor.<p class="message sent">Wonderful! Thank you so much. Do you have any other recommendations for something to accompany my Paella?<p class=message>Of course! You could also try some Spanish tortilla, which is a type of omelette with potatoes and onions, or some fresh bread with olive oil and garlic.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. I will definitely get some of that too. Thank you for your help, Juan.<p class=message>My pleasure, Maria. It's always a pleasure to see people enjoying the great food we have here in Sevilla.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to try it all out. I am sure my guests will love it too.<p class=message>Well, we take great pride in our produce, so I have no doubt you will make something truly special. Have a great day, Maria!<p class="message sent">You too, Juan. Thanks again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1eca0c9c-2241-4ad1-81ba-c3fcdf6d01f6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
