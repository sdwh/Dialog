How are you feeling today, B?<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm doing alright, just a little bored being stuck in this hospital bed. How about you?<p class=message>I know what you mean. I'm A, by the way, one of the nurses here. And I'm doing pretty well, thanks. Just wanted to pop in and see how you're doing.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. That's kind of you. Can I ask you a random question?<p class=message>Sure, go ahead.<p class="message sent">Have you ever broken a bone?<p class=message>Actually, I have! I broke my arm doing somersaults on a trampoline when I was a kid.<p class="message sent">Oh no! That must have hurt. Did you have to wear a cast?<p class=message>Yes, I did. It was really itchy though, and I remember sneaking a coat hanger down there to scratch it.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's funny. I can't imagine how uncomfortable a cast would be.<p class=message>It's definitely not the most pleasant experience, but it's one way to learn patience and humility.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I can see that. Speaking of patience, I'm getting really impatient to leave this place.<p class=message>I completely understand. But just hang in there a little while longer, alright? The doctors will want to make sure you're fully recovered before they let you go home.<p class="message sent">I know, I know. It's just hard to be patient when all I want to do is go home and sleep in my own bed.<p class=message>I totally get it. Luckily, we have some pretty comfy beds here, too.<p class="message sent">Haha, I guess that's true.<p class=message>Alright, well I better get back to my rounds. But feel free to buzz me or any of the other nurses if you need anything. We're here to help you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. You're the best.<p class=message>No problem, B. Hang in there and stay positive.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9914864e-7a48-4f52-8aa0-a54c428ccb3f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
