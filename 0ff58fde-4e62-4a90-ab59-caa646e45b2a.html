Are you a big fan of opera?<p class=message>To be honest, I don't have much knowledge about opera but I think it's fascinating how you can convey emotions through music.<p class="message sent">That's true, opera is all about emotions. What's your favorite kind of music?<p class=message>I'm more into pop music, but I'm open to trying new things.<p class="message sent">That's great, I hope you'll enjoy our performance tonight. We'll be singing in Italian, but there will be English subtitles so you can follow the story.<p class=message>Oh, that's really helpful. Is there anything I should know about the performance?<p class="message sent">Well, it's a tragic story about a woman who sacrificed everything for love. But don't worry, we'll make sure to lighten the mood with some comedic moments too.<p class=message>That sounds interesting, I can't wait to see it. How long have you been performing opera?<p class="message sent">I've been singing since I was a child, but I've been performing opera for about 10 years now. It's a challenging but rewarding art form.<p class=message>I can imagine, it takes a lot of skill to sing in such a powerful way. Do you have any pre-show rituals or superstitions?<p class="message sent">Yes, I always drink hot tea with honey before a performance to soothe my throat. And I always wear a piece of jewelry that was passed down from my grandmother, it's kind of a good luck charm.<p class=message>That's really sweet, it shows how much you care about your craft. Well, I don't want to take up any more of your time. Break a leg tonight, I'll be cheering for you!<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, I really appreciate it. Enjoy the show!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0ff45190-6d81-46c3-857e-7fd2079707bb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
