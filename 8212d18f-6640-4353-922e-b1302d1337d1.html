How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">Can't complain, A. Busy morning as always. How about you?<p class=message>Not too shabby. Just finished preparing the bacon and eggs for breakfast. Those Texans sure love their breakfast meat.<p class="message sent">(Laughs) That they do. Speaking of which, I've got a special request from one of our regulars. He wants his eggs sunny-side up with a side of jalapeño toast.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. I'll make sure to get that right to him. By the way, did you know that Texans consume more chili per capita than any other state in the US?<p class="message sent">Really? That's interesting. I guess it makes sense with all the Tex-Mex cuisine around here.<p class=message>Yeah, and speaking of Tex-Mex, do you think we could add some more jalapeños to our chili recipe? I think it would give it a nice kick.<p class="message sent">I'm all for it. Let's give it a shot and see how it goes over with our customers.<p class=message>Speaking of our customers, did you notice that family in the corner? They've been here for close to an hour and a half.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I noticed. I think they're going for the Guinness World Record for longest time spent at a buffet.<p class=message>(Laughs) Well, maybe they're just enjoying the food and each other's company.<p class="message sent">Optimistic as ever, A. But it's good to see people enjoying themselves. That's why we do what we do.<p class=message>Couldn't agree more. Hey, boss, want to try some of my newest dessert creation? It's chocolate-covered bacon.<p class="message sent">(Raises an eyebrow) Chocolate-covered bacon? You have my attention. Let's give it a taste test.<p class=message>(Smiling) I knew you'd say yes. One plate of chocolate-covered bacon coming right up.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=82015f8b-51f8-4be9-9f11-5d31ae710338.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
