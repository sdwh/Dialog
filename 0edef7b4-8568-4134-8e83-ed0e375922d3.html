My name is Grace, and I'll be your naturalist guide for today's eco-adventure. Are you all excited to see some wildlife in their natural habitat?<p class="message sent">Yes, we are! We've been looking forward to this trip for months. What kind of animals do you think we might see today?<p class=message>Well, we have a great chance of spotting bison, elk, deer, coyotes, and even bears if we're lucky. But remember, we want to observe from a distance and not disturb them.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, we want to keep both the animals and ourselves safe. What kind of plants and trees can we expect to see in the area?<p class=message>The park boasts a variety of coniferous and deciduous trees like pine, spruce, fir, aspen, and birch. We'll also see different types of wildflowers and shrubs that are native to the area.<p class="message sent">Wow, it sounds so beautiful. What measures are in place to protect the wildlife and their environment?<p class=message>There are designated trails and viewing areas to minimize our impact on the animals and their habitats. We also have strict rules to follow, like not littering, staying on the trails, and not feeding the animals.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Your work as a naturalist must be so rewarding. What inspired you to become one?<p class=message>I've always loved nature and was curious about the different species that exist. Then, I became aware of the many threats facing our planet and knew I wanted to help in some way. Becoming a naturalist was the perfect way to combine my passion and my desire to make a positive impact.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. We need more people like you. Thank you for sharing that with us. We're excited to learn more and see some wildlife today.<p class=message>I'm thrilled to have you all here with me. Let's start our adventure and see what the park has in store for us!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0edda2f8-ba70-4b2e-8b2b-da9cc0de824d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
