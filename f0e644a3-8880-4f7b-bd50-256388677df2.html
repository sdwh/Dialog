I went to this new BBQ joint in town and ate so much brisket.<p class=message>Nice, did you try any of their signature cocktails?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I tried their smoked old fashioned. It was amazing.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. Speaking of cocktails, I'm working on a new recipe with jalapeno-infused tequila.<p class="message sent">Ooh, that sounds spicy. Can I try it?<p class=message>Of course, I'll make you one after we're finished here.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. So, I heard we're getting a new bartender tomorrow.<p class=message>Yeah, I heard the owner hired a guy from New Orleans who's known for his amazing hurricane cocktails.<p class="message sent">That's exciting. Do you think he'll fit in with our team?<p class=message>As long as he's a team player and doesn't mind our Texas-sized sense of humor, I think he'll be just fine.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well, we definitely know how to have a good time around here.<p class=message>Speaking of a good time, have you heard about the trivia night we're hosting next week?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm thinking about forming a team with some of the regulars.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I'll have to join in too and show off my vast knowledge of useless facts.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I'll make sure to keep you on my team then.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f0e514a1-2d0f-440c-9979-3677328b9bea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
