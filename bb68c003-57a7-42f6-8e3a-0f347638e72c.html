Looks like we're both pretty busy tonight!<p class="message sent">Yep, definitely! I've got a bunch of fish to cook up.<p class=message>And I've got a table full of hungry customers waiting for their beef.<p class="message sent">Speaking of beef, have you tried the Wagyu here yet? It's pretty amazing.<p class=message>Oh yeah, I've had it a few times. It practically melts in your mouth.<p class="message sent">I'm more of a fish guy myself. Have you tasted the grilled mackerel? It's one of our bestsellers.<p class=message>Actually, I haven't tried it yet. Maybe I'll have to sneak a piece later.<p class="message sent">Ha, don't worry. I'll share some with you. Just make sure you save some of that beef for me.<p class=message>Deal! Hey, have you ever cooked any unusual fish here?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, once we had a customer who asked for fugu.<p class=message>Fugu? That's the one that's poisonous if it's not prepared correctly, right?<p class="message sent">That's the one! Luckily, our head chef is trained in preparing it safely.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. I don't think I could handle that kind of pressure.<p class="message sent">It can definitely be nerve-wracking the first few times. But it's all part of the job.<p class=message>Yeah, that's true. Speaking of which, I should probably get back to grilling. See you later!<p class="message sent">Take care! Don't forget to save me some Wagyu.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bb63eaba-e5d4-4247-8b5c-33fc319a9cde.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
