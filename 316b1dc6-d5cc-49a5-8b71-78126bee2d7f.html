I'm a reporter from the Daily Buzz. Mind if I ask you a few questions?<p class="message sent">Not at all! I always love talking to the media.<p class=message>Great! First off, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. My name is Mike, and I work as a clown for children's parties.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a fun job! How did you get into that line of work?<p class="message sent">Actually, I started out as a stand-up comedian, but I found that I enjoyed interacting with kids more. So, I changed my act and became a clown.<p class=message>That's really interesting. Do you ever encounter any funny or unusual situations on the job?<p class="message sent">Definitely! One time, I accidentally got stuck in a bouncy castle with a bunch of little kids, and we couldn't stop bouncing.<p class=message>(laughs) That sounds like a blast. So, what do you think makes a good kid's party?<p class="message sent">Well, I think a good mix of games, activities, and entertainment is important. And of course, lots of candy and cake!<p class=message>(smiling) Agreed! Lastly, do you have any advice for anyone who might want to pursue a career as a clown?<p class="message sent">Just remember to always stay positive and bring joy to others. And never be afraid to act silly!<p class=message>(nodding) I think that's great advice. Thanks so much for your time, Mike. It was really great talking to you.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Thanks for stopping by!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3166e720-19a6-4964-8b50-7df8733ff471.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
