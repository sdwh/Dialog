I'm excited for my flight today.<p class="message sent">Hi A, welcome to the check-in counter. Where are you headed to?<p class=message>I'll be flying to Bangkok for a short vacation. How about you?<p class="message sent">That sounds fun! As for me, I'm based here at the airport. I get to meet lots of travelers like you.<p class=message>That's great. How long have you been working here?<p class="message sent">I've been with this airline for almost 5 years now. I can say I really enjoy my job.<p class=message>That's good to hear. You must have seen all kinds of passengers, huh?<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely. Some are really interesting too. Like one time, a passenger brought a pet lizard on board!<p class=message>(laughs) Wow, that's quite unusual. I hope it didn't cause any commotion.<p class="message sent">No, actually it was well-behaved. It stayed in its cage the whole time.<p class=message>(amused) Only the in-flight entertainment was probably a bit different.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I suppose so. Anyway, have you checked in your luggage already?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I also checked in online to save some time.<p class="message sent">Great. Here's your boarding pass then. Have a safe and enjoyable trip!<p class=message>Thank you, B. You've been really helpful. I'll make sure to say hi to all the lizards I'll see in Bangkok.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Sure thing. Take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7a595202-5841-44f5-adfd-c19c2ad16414.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
