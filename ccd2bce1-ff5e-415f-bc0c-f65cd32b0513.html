I'm interested in playing a game, how do I go about it?<p class="message sent">Hi, yes we do have a tennis court. You can make a reservation at the front desk or by calling us directly.<p class=message>That's great. What are the available hours for playing?<p class="message sent">The court is open from 8 AM to 7 PM daily. You can reserve the court for an hour or more depending on your preference.<p class=message>How about the equipment? Do you provide tennis rackets and balls?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do provide tennis rackets and balls. You can borrow them at the front desk when you make your reservation.<p class=message>Awesome. Is there a dress code or any other requirements for using the tennis court?<p class="message sent">There is no specific dress code, but we encourage players to wear proper athletic shoes for safety. Also, please keep noise levels to a minimum as a courtesy to other guests.<p class=message>Okay, got it. How much does it cost to rent the court?<p class="message sent">It's $15 per hour for guests staying at the hotel, and $20 per hour for non-guests.<p class=message>That's reasonable. Can I bring a friend to play with me?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, you can bring a friend or two. Just let us know when you make your reservation so we can allocate enough equipment for everyone.<p class=message>Thanks a lot! Can I use the court in the evenings too?<p class="message sent">Sorry, the court is only available during the day due to our neighbors' peace and quiet.<p class=message>No worries, I understand. Is there anything else I should know before I reserve the court?<p class="message sent">Just make sure to cancel your reservation at least 24 hours in advance if you need to change your plans. Otherwise, we'll have to charge you for the court time.<p class=message>Understood. Thank you very much for your help, I'll definitely make a reservation soon.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Have a great time playing tennis and enjoy your stay at our hotel!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ccd20f27-dd1a-4cf5-8f1b-ebd5c1eaa903.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
