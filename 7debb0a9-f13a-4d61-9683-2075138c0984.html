I'm excited to hear what you've been working on.<p class=message>Well, I've been writing a new novel about a detective who has a fear of elevators.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting! What's the title?<p class=message>I was thinking "The Case of the Staircase Sleuth."<p class="message sent">I like the play on words. Have you finished the manuscript?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's about 300 pages long.<p class="message sent">Great. Have you thought about the target audience for your book?<p class=message>Yes, I'm aiming for young adults who enjoy mystery and suspense.<p class="message sent">That's a good choice. Have you considered any promotional events?<p class=message>I was thinking of hosting a book signing at a local bookstore. Maybe we could also do a social media campaign.<p class="message sent">Those are both great ideas. We could also try to get some book reviews from popular bloggers or book critics.<p class=message>That's a good idea. Do you have any suggestions for a book cover?<p class="message sent">How about a dark and ominous staircase with the title in bold font?<p class=message>I like that. We could also add some graphics to make it more eye-catching.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Let's work on getting the book printed and distributed. I'm confident it will be a success.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I appreciate your support and guidance throughout this process.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. I'm looking forward to seeing your book on the shelves.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7deb8ae5-7cd3-4b3a-9040-3a81e4aa2b5e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
