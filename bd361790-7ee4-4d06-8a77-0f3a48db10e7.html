My name is Alex and I’ll be your tour guide for today. Are you ready to explore one of the most iconic landmarks in the world?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I’ve been looking forward to this visit for months.<p class=message>Great to hear that! First, let’s talk briefly about the history of the Opera House. Did you know that the design was chosen through an international competition?<p class="message sent">Wow, that’s interesting! How many entries were there?<p class=message>There were more than 200 entries submitted from all over the world. The winner was a Danish architect named Jørn Utzon. The construction process took 14 years!<p class="message sent">It definitely looks worth the wait. The exterior is breathtaking!<p class=message>Yes, it is! The unique design is made up of over a million white and cream-colored tiles. It reflects the sun in different ways throughout the day.<p class="message sent">That’s incredible! What about the interior?<p class=message>The interior is just as impressive. The concert hall seats over 2,600 people and the stage can hold up to 1,000 performers. Let’s take a closer look!<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing! I can’t wait to see it.<p class=message>Great! Let’s head inside and take a look at the stunning architecture and acoustics of the hall.<p class="message sent">I’m blown away! The acoustics are fantastic! No wonder it’s considered one of the best music venues in the world!<p class=message>Yes, it is! Fun fact - the famous American singer Frank Sinatra once said the Opera House was the most beautiful venue he had ever performed in.<p class="message sent">That’s a great anecdote! It’s definitely worth seeing for yourself. Thank you, Alex, for the wonderful tour!<p class=message>You’re welcome! I’m glad you enjoyed it.
