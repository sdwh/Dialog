Welcome to the Sydney Opera House tour. My name is Sarah and I'll be your guide for today. Is everyone excited for the tour?"<p class="message sent">"Yes, we're really excited to see this iconic landmark. It's been on our bucket list for a while now."<p class=message>"Great to hear that. Well, let's start the tour then. Did you know that the Sydney Opera House was designed by a Danish architect, Jorn Utzon?"<p class="message sent">"No, I didn't know that. I thought it was designed by an Australian architect."<p class=message>"Jorn Utzon won the competition to design the Opera House in 1957, and it took over 14 years to build it."<p class="message sent">"That's impressive! So, what's the largest auditorium in the Opera House?"<p class=message>"The largest auditorium is the Concert Hall, which holds about 2,700 people. It has a stunning organ that has over 10,000 pipes."<p class="message sent">"Wow, that's huge! How about the smaller auditoriums?"<p class=message>"There are two smaller auditoriums. The Opera Theatre is a horseshoe-shaped theatre that seats around 1,500 people, and the Drama Theatre seats about 500 people."<p class="message sent">"I'm excited to see them all! By the way, what's the best time to visit the Opera House?"<p class=message>"I'd say the best time to visit is during the Vivid Sydney festival, which happens every year in May and June. It's a spectacular light and sound show that transforms the Opera House and the surrounding harbor."<p class="message sent">"That sounds amazing! We'll definitely come back for that."<p class=message>"I highly recommend it. And we've come to the end of the tour. Thank you for joining us and I hope you enjoyed it!"<p class="message sent">"Thank you so much, Sarah. We really enjoyed the tour and learned a lot about the Opera House."<p class=message>"You're very welcome, enjoy the rest of your stay in Sydney!"</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ad2a3de2-c999-4136-afa2-f5e5904c012e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
