So, how long will the tour take?<p class=message>We'll be out exploring for about three hours, with plenty of stops along the way. I'll be sharing some interesting facts and stories about the rainforest as we go.<p class="message sent">Great, I can't wait! It's good to finally get some fresh air away from the city.<p class=message>Absolutely! You'll find that being surrounded by all this natural beauty is a great way to unwind and reconnect.
