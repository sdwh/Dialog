That sounds delicious. Have you made a cake before?<p class="message sent">No, but I watched a video online and it looked really easy.<p class=message>Okay, let's go over the ingredients and get started. We'll need flour, sugar, eggs, milk, cocoa powder, baking powder and butter.<p class="message sent">Got it! Can I measure the ingredients?<p class=message>Of course, that's a great way to practice your math skills.<p class="message sent">This is so fun, I love baking with you mom.<p class=message>Me too, it reminds me of when I used to bake with my mom. Okay, now we mix everything together.<p class="message sent">Wow, it's starting to look like cake batter. Can I taste it?<p class=message>Sure, just a little bit. How does it taste?<p class="message sent">Yum, it's sweet and chocolatey.<p class=message>Now we pour it into the pan and put it in the oven.<p class="message sent">How long do we need to wait?<p class=message>About 30 minutes, but we can make the strawberry topping while we wait.<p class="message sent">This is so exciting, I can't wait to try it!<p class=message>It smells so good, I think it's ready. Let it cool for a bit and then we can decorate it with the strawberries.<p class="message sent">It looks amazing, I'm so proud of us. Can we cut a slice and taste it?<p class=message>Yes! Let's dig in. Mmm, it's delicious. You did a great job, honey.<p class="message sent">Thanks mom, I couldn't have done it without you. Can we make another one soon?<p class=message>Absolutely, let's make baking a tradition in our family.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=45cdeb73-8c2a-4b13-9e0d-6000d17afd8e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
