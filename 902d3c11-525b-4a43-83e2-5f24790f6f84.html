How is everything going with the course so far?<p class="message sent">Hey, A. It's going pretty well, thanks for asking. I feel like I'm keeping up with everything.<p class=message>That's great to hear, B. Just wanted to check in and see if there's anything you need extra help with, or if there are any parts of the course you're finding particularly challenging?<p class="message sent">Hmm, actually, the grammar exercises have been a bit tricky for me. But I've been practicing with some online quizzes, and I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.<p class=message>Excellent! Good for you for taking the initiative to practice. Do you have any specific questions you want to go over together?<p class="message sent">Actually, I did want to ask about the difference between "affect" and "effect." I keep getting those mixed up.<p class=message>Ah, yes. That's definitely a tricky one. Mind if we go over a few examples together?<p class="message sent">Not at all, that would be really helpful.<p class=message>Okay, so let's say you're talking about how eating too much sugar can have an impact on your health. Would you use "affect" or "effect" in that sentence?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think it would be "affect" since it's referring to the action of sugar on my health.<p class=message>Exactly! Now, what about if you're describing the result of eating too much sugar? Like, "The effect of eating too much sugar is weight gain."<p class="message sent">Oh, then it would be "effect" since that's the outcome of the action.<p class=message>Perfect, B. You're getting the hang of it! Keep up the great work, and if there's anything else you need help with, don't hesitate to reach out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=902c8ecc-e7b2-4539-81c0-aead3c8dd264.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
