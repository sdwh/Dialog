How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too, thanks for asking. So, I see that you have some fresh fruits here. How do you sell them easily?<p class="message sent">Well, I usually try to display them in an attractive way that catches people's attention. That way they're more likely to buy them.<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea. How do you decide on the price though?<p class="message sent">I take into consideration the cost of the produce and try to keep my margin reasonable. I also check the pricing at nearby markets for comparison.<p class=message>That's smart. Do you have any specific fruits that sell best?<p class="message sent">Yes, during the summer months, watermelons and mangoes are in high demand. In the winter, people tend to buy more oranges and apples.<p class=message>Oh, I see. Do you ever offer any promotions or discounts?<p class="message sent">Yes, occasionally I offer discounts for customers who buy larger quantities or frequent buyers. It helps build loyalty and increases sales volume.<p class=message>That's great. Have you ever thought about expanding your product range?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been considering adding dried fruits and nuts to my inventory. What do you think?<p class=message>I think that's a great idea. It adds more options for customers and can also bring in new business. Have you tried selling through online channels too?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've been thinking about it. Do you have any suggestions for platforms to sell on?<p class=message>There are many websites and apps available, such as Amazon, eBay, and local online markets. You could also consider setting up your own website or social media page to attract customers.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tips, I'll definitely look into it. It was great talking to you!<p class=message>Likewise, have a successful day selling your fruits and I'll see you around.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fa1df6ec-17ee-4011-ac78-3b72bc84b839.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
