I'm a musician and I'm excited to discuss our album release plan.<p class="message sent">Hi, it's great to meet you too. Our record company is eager to hear your proposal.<p class=message>So, we have a few options in mind. One is to release a single first and see how it does before dropping the whole album.<p class="message sent">That's a good strategy. What kind of sound are you going for with this album?<p class=message>We're exploring different genres but it's mostly alternative rock with a twist of funk and blues.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. What's the target market for this music?<p class=message>Well, we're hoping to attract a younger audience who enjoy live music and want to be part of the experience.<p class="message sent">That's smart thinking. Have you considered doing any promotions or live performances for the album release?<p class=message>Definitely, we're planning on doing a few live shows and possibly partnering with some local businesses to promote the album.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. How many songs are on the album?<p class=message>There are 12 tracks on the album so it's a full-length project.<p class="message sent">Perfect, we can discuss the details further and come up with a solid release plan. Thanks for meeting with me today.<p class=message>Thank you as well, we're looking forward to working with your company on this project.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fe27400c-32cf-4111-8353-cd5a2a953c1d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
