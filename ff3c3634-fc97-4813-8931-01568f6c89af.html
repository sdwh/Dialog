I'm not sure where to start.<p class="message sent">I know, right? I feel like I'm in food heaven.<p class=message>Have you tried the sushi? It looks so fresh.<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. It's delicious! I also love the stir-fried noodles.<p class=message>Oh cool, I haven't tried that yet. I'll definitely give it a taste.<p class="message sent">You should also try the chocolate brownies. They're so good, it's like a party in your mouth.<p class=message>Mmm, sounds tempting. I have to save room for dessert, though. There are so many options.<p class="message sent">I feel the same way. But don't worry, we have all day to try everything.<p class=message>That's true. Hey, have you been exploring the city much?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. Yesterday, I visited a famous art museum, and the day before that, I went to a popular shopping district.<p class=message>Wow, you're definitely making the most of your trip.<p class="message sent">I try to. What about you? Have you done any sightseeing?<p class=message>Yes, I went to the top of the tallest building yesterday. The view was stunning.<p class="message sent">That's awesome! I'm planning to go there tomorrow. Did you take any cool pictures?<p class=message>Yeah, I took a bunch. I can show you later.<p class="message sent">Nice! We should also take a picture together to commemorate our trip.<p class=message>Definitely!
