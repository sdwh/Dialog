How's it going?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon! I'm doing well, thank you. Where are you headed today?<p class=message>I'm on my way to Kyoto. I've never been there before, so I'm excited to explore.<p class="message sent">Oh, Kyoto is a fantastic place to visit. There are so many beautiful temples and shrines to see.<p class=message>That's what I've heard. Do you have a favorite temple or shrine?<p class="message sent">I'd have to say that Kiyomizu-dera is my favorite. It has a wonderful view of the city from the top of the hill.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. Do you think I'll have time to see it today?<p class="message sent">It depends on your schedule, but I think you could fit it in. You might want to check out Fushimi Inari Taisha as well. It's famous for its thousands of torii gates.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. Thanks for the advice!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It's always nice to see people enjoying Kyoto. Have you tried any of the local food yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm looking forward to it. Any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Yes, you have to try some matcha-flavored sweets. They're a specialty of Kyoto. And if you're feeling adventurous, maybe give takoyaki a try.<p class=message>Takoyaki? What's that?<p class="message sent">It's a type of snack made with octopus and batter. It's really popular here in Kansai.<p class=message>Hm, I'm not sure if octopus is my thing, but I'll keep an open mind.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit! You never know until you try it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=07f0ecf6-a5d7-411d-b938-977a6e500053.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
