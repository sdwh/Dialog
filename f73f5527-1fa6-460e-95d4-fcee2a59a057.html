Have you tested it out thoroughly?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I ran some unit tests and it seems to be working as expected.<p class=message>Awesome, I really appreciate your efforts on this project.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'm glad I can be of help. By the way, have you heard of the latest JS framework that's gaining popularity?<p class=message>Hmm, are you referring to React or Vue?<p class="message sent">Nope, this one's called Svelte. It's supposed to be a game-changer in terms of performance.<p class=message>Oh, I see. I'll have to check it out and see if it's suitable for our project.<p class="message sent">Definitely, it might just be what we need to optimize our app. By the way, what do you think of our company's new remote work policy?<p class=message>It's pretty convenient, I don't have to deal with traffic and I get to work in the comfort of my own home.<p class="message sent">I agree, but I do miss the social interaction and collaboration we used to have at the office.<p class=message>Same here, but we can still have virtual meetings and connect through messaging apps.<p class="message sent">You're right, it's not the same as face-to-face, but it's better than nothing at all.<p class=message>Definitely, let's keep pushing forward and adapting to these changes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f73edc40-2414-48fe-b185-b6cc9dafd534.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
