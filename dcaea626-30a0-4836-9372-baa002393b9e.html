You seem down.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've just been feeling kind of sad lately. I don't really know why.<p class=message>That sucks, have you tried talking to anyone about it?<p class="message sent">Not really, I guess I'm just not really sure who to talk to.<p class=message>Well, you can always talk to me! I'm always here to listen.<p class="message sent">That means a lot, thanks. It's just been a lot of little things that have been getting me down.<p class=message>Hey, I totally get that. Sometimes it feels like everything is just piling up.<p class="message sent">Yeah, exactly! And then I start to feel like I'm overreacting or being dramatic.<p class=message>No way, your feelings are totally valid. It's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes.<p class="message sent">I really appreciate you saying that. I just don't want to be a burden on anyone.<p class=message>Trust me, you're not a burden. And if you ever need to vent or talk things out, I'm here for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I really mean that. It's nice to have someone to talk to who won't judge me.<p class=message>Of course! We all need someone to talk to sometimes. So, what have you been doing to try and cheer yourself up?<p class="message sent">Honestly, not much. Just watching some funny shows, trying to get enough sleep, that kind of thing.<p class=message>Well, those are good starts! Have you thought about doing something fun to take your mind off things?<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. Do you have any suggestions?<p class=message>Hmm, how about we plan a little outing or something? Maybe go see a movie or grab some lunch?<p class="message sent">That sounds great, actually. It would be good to get out of the house and do something different.<p class=message>Awesome, I'm glad you're up for it. Let's plan something for this weekend!<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Thanks for being such a good friend, and for listening to me rant.<p class=message>Anytime, my friend. That's what friends are for!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dca1f4e2-e338-4c8d-bab2-1979d6ed0bb1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
