I need to check the weight of my luggage before I check it in. Can you help me out?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'd be happy to assist you. Just place your bags on the scale over here, and we'll see how much they weigh.<p class=message>Great. I always overpack, so I hope they're not too heavy.<p class="message sent">No worries, we've all been there. Let's take a look. Hmm, it looks like these weigh about 45 pounds each.<p class=message>Oh no! I didn't realize I had packed that much. Do I need to pay an extra fee now?<p class="message sent">Actually, your ticket includes two pieces of luggage, so you're all set. You just need to make sure they're within the weight limit of 50 pounds each.<p class=message>Phew, that's a relief. Thanks for letting me know. By the way, I love your accent - where are you from?<p class="message sent">Thank you! I'm actually from Australia. Have you ever been there?<p class=message>I haven't, but I've always wanted to visit. What's your favorite thing about Australia?<p class="message sent">That's a tough question. I love our beaches, our wildlife, and our laid-back culture. And of course, our coffee is pretty amazing too.<p class=message>I've heard about Australian coffee - apparently the flat white is really popular there. Have you tried it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I drink flat whites all the time. It's basically a stronger latte with less milk, and it's become a staple of our coffee culture.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. I'll definitely have to try one when I visit. Thanks for the tip!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Enjoy your flight, and have a great trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a9cda92f-9df0-45d2-a998-a7b37d6439e6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
