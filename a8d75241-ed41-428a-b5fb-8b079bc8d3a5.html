Have you?<p class=message>Yeah, I've lived in a few different countries actually. The biggest challenge is finding affordable housing.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've heard that before. What's the best way to find a good place to live?<p class=message>Well, I usually start by looking on websites like Airbnb or Craigslist. It's important to read reviews and make sure the location is convenient for your needs.<p class="message sent">How much does it usually cost for a decent place?<p class=message>It really depends on the location and the season. I've paid anywhere from $500 to $2000 a month.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a pretty big range. What's the most expensive place you've stayed in?<p class=message>Probably when I was living in Tokyo. The housing market there is crazy! I was paying over $2000 a month for a tiny apartment.<p class="message sent">Yikes, I hope I can find something more affordable than that. Do you have any tips for negotiating rent?<p class=message>Definitely try to negotiate if you can. Landlords are often willing to lower the price if you can commit to a longer lease or pay more upfront.<p class="message sent">Good to know. I'll have to brush up on my negotiation skills.<p class=message>And don't forget to factor in other expenses like utilities, internet, and transportation.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've heard that public transportation is pretty expensive in some countries.<p class=message>It can be, but it's usually still cheaper than owning a car.<p class="message sent">That's true. Thanks for all the advice! I can't wait to start my international adventure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a8d4ad05-fc83-45bb-8b2c-73741408c904.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
