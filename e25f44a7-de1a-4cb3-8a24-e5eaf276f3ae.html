How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning A! I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How's business today?<p class="message sent">It's been pretty busy so far. We have a lot of reservations for tonight.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm glad to see the restaurant doing well.<p class="message sent">Yes, me too. By the way, have you tried the new dish we added to the menu last week?<p class=message>No, I haven't had the chance to try it yet. What is it?<p class="message sent">It's a seafood paella. It's been getting great feedback from customers.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll make sure to try it next time I have a break.<p class="message sent">Speaking of breaks, how's the kitchen running? Do you need any assistance?<p class=message>Everything's going smoothly so far. But thanks for asking. By the way, did you hear about the new coffee shop that just opened down the street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's so special about it?<p class=message>They have a unique artisanal blend and they're getting a lot of buzz on social media.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. We should check it out during our next day off.<p class=message>Definitely. It would be nice to try something new.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Well, I have to get back to checking the reservations. See you later, A.<p class=message>See you later, B.
