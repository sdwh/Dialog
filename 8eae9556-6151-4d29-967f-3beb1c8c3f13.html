What brings you to the pharmacy today?<p class=message>I have a patient who is having some issues with their current medication regimen, and I was hoping to get your input on possible adjustments.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. What medication and dosage is the patient currently taking?<p class=message>They're on 20mg of lisinopril for hypertension, but their blood pressure is still not well controlled.<p class="message sent">Okay, we can increase the dosage or switch to a different medication. Have you checked the patient's kidney function recently?<p class=message>Yes, their renal function is normal.<p class="message sent">Then we can definitely consider increasing the dosage. Any other concerns?<p class=message>The patient also has a history of mild asthma and is currently on an albuterol inhaler as needed. But they're using it more frequently lately.<p class="message sent">We can add a daily maintenance inhaler like Flovent or Advair to help with their asthma control.<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea. What are your thoughts on their current medication for high cholesterol?<p class="message sent">If the patient is taking a statin and still has elevated LDL levels, we may need to increase the dosage or add a second medication like ezetimibe.<p class=message>Thanks for your input, B. I'll follow up with the patient and discuss their options.<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to help. Let me know if you have any other questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8ea89505-8f68-48ea-87b2-2f0bca9f5976.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
