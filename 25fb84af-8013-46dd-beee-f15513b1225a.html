I am the head chef of the hotel here. What brings you to this lovely place?<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me! I am a wine critic, visiting Hokkaido to try out some of their fantastic wines and foods. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Our top wine here is the Hokkaido Ice Wine, made from grapes that are left on the vine until frozen. It pairs perfectly with our locally sourced salmon dish.<p class="message sent">That sounds divine! I must try it. I noticed that you use a lot of local ingredients in your dishes. How does that differ from using imported ingredients?<p class=message>Using local ingredients allows us to showcase the unique, fresh flavors of Hokkaido. Plus, it supports our local farmers and sustains the community.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! It's always a plus when restaurants prioritize sustainability and ethical sourcing.<p class=message>Absolutely! We have to do our part in conserving the environment. Speaking of sustainable practices, have you tried our eco-friendly paper straws?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! They're an excellent alternative to plastic straws. I'm glad to see that you're implementing eco-friendly measures.<p class=message>Thank you! We aim to reduce our carbon footprint in every way possible. Would you like to try our signature dessert, Haskap Berry ice cream?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! I've heard about the nutritional benefits of haskap berries. I'm curious to see how it tastes in ice cream form.<p class=message>You won't be disappointed! The tartness of the berry pairs perfectly with the creaminess of the ice cream. And, it's a healthier dessert option, too.<p class="message sent">I'm excited to taste this! By the way, I noticed that you hold cooking workshops for guests. How fun! What inspired you to do that?<p class=message>It's a great way for our guests to learn how to cook simple yet delicious meals using local ingredients. We want them to take away a unique experience from their visit here.<p class="message sent">That's a fantastic idea! I bet it's a popular activity among visitors.<p class=message>Yes, it is! We've had guests of all ages and nationalities attend our workshops. It's always a pleasure to see them enjoying themselves and learning at the same time.<p class="message sent">It sounds like you're dedicated to providing the best dining experience for your guests. Thank you for having me and sharing your knowledge about Hokkaido's cuisine.<p class=message>It's been a pleasure! We're always happy to share our culinary creations and showcase the beauty of Hokkaido. Have a safe trip back home!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=25f94156-e33e-4bfe-846e-9eac42461fb8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
