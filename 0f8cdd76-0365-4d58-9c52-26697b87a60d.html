Just buried in a ton of editing work for the upcoming season.<p class=message>That sounds like fun. Speaking of the upcoming season, I wanted to chat with you about something. I've just finished up the first draft of my latest manuscript and I feel like it's ready for publication.<p class="message sent">Great, let me take a look at it. What's it about?<p class=message>It's a light-hearted rom-com set in a small town in the Midwest. Think You've Got Mail meets Parks and Rec.<p class="message sent">Sounds intriguing. What's your plan for publishing?<p class=message>I'm looking for a traditional publisher. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Sure, I can send some names your way. But just a quick question, how have you been promoting your work so far?<p class=message>Social media, mostly. I've been trying to build up my Twitter following, but I know it's hard to make a big impact without a substantial following.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's definitely a challenge. But you have to start somewhere, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. It's all part of the process. And speaking of the process, do you think there's anything in my manuscript that needs some major revision?<p class="message sent">I don't think so. There are a few places where I think the pacing could be tightened up, but all in all, I think it's a pretty solid draft.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Thanks for taking a look, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to help a talented author. Just make sure you save me a signed copy when it hits the shelves!<p class=message>Will do. And I'll save you a front-row seat at the launch party, too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0f8b0576-6359-429a-b22d-6b8929705fef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
