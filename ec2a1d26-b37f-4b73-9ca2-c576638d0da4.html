Where are you headed today?<p class=message>I'm actually headed to Boston for a business trip. Have you ever been?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, plenty of times. It's a great city with lots to see and do.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I'm hoping to have some time to explore while I'm there.<p class="message sent">You definitely should. The Freedom Trail is a must-see, and there are so many great restaurants and pubs to check out.<p class=message>I'll definitely have to make a list. So, how long have you been driving taxis?<p class="message sent">Oh, I've been doing it for about 10 years now. It's a good gig for someone like me who likes to be on the go.<p class=message>That's impressive. Have you had any crazy experiences while driving?<p class="message sent">Oh, plenty. From wild passengers to traffic jams to unexpected detours, it's always an adventure.<p class=message>I can only imagine. I used to drive a lot for work and I think I had more than my fair share of road rage incidents.<p class="message sent">Ha! Yeah, it can be frustrating. But I find that listening to music or audiobooks helps to pass the time.<p class=message>Do you have a favorite type of music or book to listen to?<p class="message sent">I'm a big classic rock fan, so that's usually my go-to. And as for books, I really enjoy biographies and history books.<p class=message>That's interesting. I've been wanting to read more non-fiction myself, but I always seem to end up with fiction books.<p class="message sent">There's nothing wrong with fiction! It's a great way to escape reality for a while.<p class=message>True. Do you have a favorite book or author?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a tough one. There are so many great ones out there. But if I had to choose, I'd say my favorite author is Stephen King.<p class=message>Really? I've never been much of a horror fan myself.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I can see how it's not for everyone. But King's writing is really captivating, even if you're not a fan of the genre.<p class=message>Maybe I'll have to give him a try. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class="message sent">No problem! We're almost to the airport now. Have a great trip in Boston!<p class=message>Thanks, I will. And thanks for the great conversation.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ec264cac-f699-4819-8e8c-cdb195c0a616.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
