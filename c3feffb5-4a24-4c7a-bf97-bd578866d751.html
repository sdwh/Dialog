What's your name?<p class="message sent">Hi, my name is Rachel. Nice to meet you.<p class=message>Nice to meet you too, Rachel. Are you new to yoga or have you practiced before?<p class="message sent">I’ve tried a few classes, but I’m definitely a beginner.<p class=message>No worries, I’ll guide you through everything. Let's start by finding a comfortable spot and taking a deep breath.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, I could use some relaxation after a hectic day at work.<p class=message>I hear you! Our first pose will be a downward-facing dog. Keep your feet hip-width apart and let your head hang heavy.<p class="message sent">Okay, like this? My wrists feel a little sore already.<p class=message>Yes, exactly like that. Take a break if you need to, and try to distribute your weight evenly. We don't want any injuries.<p class="message sent">Got it, thanks. Hey, what's that smell?<p class=message>Oh, that's just the lavender essential oil I'm diffusing. It helps promote relaxation and ease tension.<p class="message sent">Wow, I never thought about using essential oils during yoga. Do you have any other favorite scents?<p class=message>Definitely eucalyptus and peppermint. They're great for clearing the sinuses and refreshing the mind.<p class="message sent">I'll have to try those next time. Thanks for the tip.<p class=message>No problem, Rachel. Let's move on to the next pose, the warrior II. Can you put your left foot forward and sink into your hips?<p class="message sent">Yes, like this?<p class=message>Perfect. Now reach out through your arms and gaze past your left fingertips. You're doing great!<p class="message sent">Thank you, I'm really enjoying the class so far. It's challenging, but also very peaceful.<p class=message>That's what yoga is all about. We're here to strengthen both our bodies and our minds. Okay, last pose - the corpse pose. Let yourself melt into the floor and relax every muscle.<p class="message sent">Ah, this feels amazing. I don't think I ever knew what true relaxation felt like before.<p class=message>That's what yoga can do for you! Thank you for coming to my class, Rachel. I hope to see you again soon.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. I’ll definitely be back. Namaste.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c3f7a61e-4b83-450b-92b4-686dfb432ada.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
