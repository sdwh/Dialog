May I have your ticket and bags for inspection, please?<p class="message sent">Sure, here you go. (hands over the ticket and bags)<p class=message>Thank you. Do you have any food or drinks in here?<p class="message sent">No, I don't, just my wallet and phone.<p class=message>Alright, thank you for cooperating. (hands back the ticket and bags) Have fun at the concert!<p class="message sent">Thank you! Hey, can I ask you a question?<p class=message>Sure, what's up?<p class="message sent">How long have you been working here? It seems like a tough job.<p class=message>About two years now. It can be tiring, but I love being a part of making events like this safe for everyone.<p class="message sent">That's really cool. Do you get to see any of the concerts or shows?<p class=message>Not really. We're mostly stationed at the entrances and exits, but we can still hear the music and see some of the excitement from the crowd.<p class="message sent">I bet it's pretty wild in there.<p class=message>Definitely. It's always a great atmosphere when everybody's having a good time.<p class="message sent">Do you have any crazy stories from working here?<p class=message>(laughs) Oh, I have a few. There was one time when a group of fans snuck in through the backstage area to meet the artists. We had to escort them out, but they were pretty determined.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's hilarious. Well, thanks for keeping us safe tonight.<p class=message>No problem. Enjoy the show!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2ed7f4d3-06a6-49cd-a6da-4eea009aa4a2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
