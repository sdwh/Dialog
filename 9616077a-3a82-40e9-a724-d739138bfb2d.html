How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm good, thanks for asking. What can I get for you today?<p class=message>I'm actually a bread maker and I wanted to try your coffee. Is there anything you'd recommend?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, our specialty is a caramel latte. It's the perfect balance of sweet and creamy.<p class=message>Sounds delicious, I'll have one of those please.<p class="message sent">Great! And what kind of bread are you making today?<p class=message>I'm experimenting with a new sourdough recipe.<p class="message sent">Sourdough is my favorite! Did you know that we use locally sourced beans and grains in our coffee and bread?<p class=message>That's amazing, I always love supporting local businesses. How long have you been a barista?<p class="message sent">About four years now. I love the creativity and precision that goes into making a good cup of coffee.<p class=message>I can definitely relate to that, bread making is an art as well. It takes patience and practice.<p class="message sent">That's true. Do you have any tips for a good sourdough?<p class=message>Sure, the key is to let the dough rest and ferment for a long time. The longer the better.<p class="message sent">I'll keep that in mind. Speaking of which, your caramel latte is ready. Enjoy!<p class=message>Thanks so much. By the way, have you tried our newest garlic and herb bread? It's flying off the shelves.<p class="message sent">Actually, I haven't yet. Sounds like I need to try some today!<p class=message>Definitely do. And I'll be sure to try your caramel latte again soon. Thanks again!<p class="message sent">Anytime, have a great day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=96081c2f-2a3b-47a1-b170-e5ed1e918ea9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
