I'll look into that right away. Thanks for catching it.<p class="message sent">No problem. That's what we testers are here for!<p class=message>So, B, have you heard any good jokes lately?<p class="message sent">Well, I did hear one about a horse that walked into a bar...<p class=message>Let me guess, the bartender said, "why the long face?"<p class="message sent">Ha! You've heard that one before, huh?<p class=message>Yeah, it's a classic. But seriously, do you have any recommendations for good lunch spots around here?<p class="message sent">Actually, there's this great deli down the street that makes amazing sandwiches.<p class=message>Nice, I'll have to check it out. And while we're on the topic of food, did you hear about the restaurant on the moon?<p class="message sent">No, what about it?<p class=message>Great food, no atmosphere.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Wow, that's terrible. But also kind of funny.<p class=message>Hey, sometimes bad puns are the best puns.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Speaking of which, have you heard the one about the guy who invented Lifesavers?<p class=message>No, I don't think so.<p class="message sent">He made a mint.<p class=message>(groans) That one's almost as bad as my moon joke.<p class="message sent">Hey, you win some, you lose some. But at least we're making progress on this software testing.<p class=message>Definitely. And with a little bit of humor to lighten the mood, we'll get through it in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f6c627a0-ad14-4091-8b7d-d17f0ec7f7c0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
