How's your studying going?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty well, thanks! I've been trying to focus on my math homework.<p class=message>Math can be a bit tough sometimes. Do you want any help with it?<p class="message sent">No, I think I've got it under control. But thanks for offering!<p class=message>Alright then. Did you know that this library has a great collection of graphic novels?<p class="message sent">Really? I didn't know that. I'm not really a fan of reading, but maybe I'll check them out.<p class=message>You might be surprised! Comic books and graphic novels can be just as educational as traditional books.<p class="message sent">Well, I guess I could use a break from all this math. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>"Watchmen" by Alan Moore is a classic, but it's pretty intense. Maybe "Nimona" by Noelle Stevenson would be more your speed.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'll add that to my list. Have you read any good books lately?<p class=message>Yes, I just finished a biography of Benjamin Franklin. He was such an interesting person!<p class="message sent">I'm more into fiction, myself. Have you ever read "Harry Potter"?<p class=message>Of course! I'm a big fan. Have you read them all?<p class="message sent">Yes, multiple times! I even took a trip to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando last year.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. I'd love to go there someday.<p class="message sent">You should! It's a really cool experience.<p class=message>Well, we should probably get back to our studying. Good luck with your math, B!<p class="message sent">Thanks, see you later!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7d62237c-0c04-453a-839c-3222defbd5a2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
