How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing pretty well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. Just been busy with work lately.<p class="message sent">Speaking of work, I wanted to chat with you about some ideas I had for improving our testing process.<p class=message>Sure, shoot away!<p class="message sent">Okay, well first off, I was thinking we could implement more automated testing.<p class=message>I like that idea. It'll definitely save us some time and effort.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And I think we could also benefit from doing more exploratory testing.<p class=message>Oh, interesting. Can you explain more about what that entails?<p class="message sent">It's basically when we approach testing more creatively and less rigidly. It can help us catch bugs we might not have thought to look for otherwise.<p class=message>Gotcha. Yeah, I think that could definitely make a big difference.<p class="message sent">Another thing we could try is crowdtesting. Have you heard of that before?<p class=message>Not really, no.<p class="message sent">It's when we use a large group of external testers to try out our software and provide feedback.<p class=message>Huh, that sounds pretty cool. Do we have the resources for something like that, though?<p class="message sent">I think so. And I think it could be really beneficial in terms of getting a wider range of perspectives on our software.<p class=message>Yeah, I can see how that would be valuable. Anything else you had in mind?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I think we should also make more of an effort to incorporate testing earlier in the development process.<p class=message>Ah, that's a good point. Catching issues earlier on would definitely save us some headaches down the line.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And ultimately, all of these changes would help us deliver better software to our customers.<p class=message>I agree. Thanks for bringing these ideas up, B. I think we should definitely start exploring them further.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And thanks for being open to the suggestions!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2e79cd30-1839-473e-b883-e0698a8d105d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
