Are you working on a report for class?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm doing research on the history of pizza.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting! What have you found so far?<p class="message sent">I've learned that pizza actually originated in Naples, Italy.<p class=message>Yes, I've heard that before. Did you know that in Naples, pizza makers are actually given special training?<p class="message sent">Really? That's fascinating. I also saw that there are many regional variations of pizza in Italy.<p class=message>Yes, and even outside of Italy too. Have you ever had Chicago-style pizza?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's so different about it?<p class=message>Well, it's much thicker than traditional pizza and often has toppings layered underneath the cheese.<p class="message sent">That sounds pretty good. Do you have a favorite kind of pizza?<p class=message>Definitely! I love Margherita pizza, which is made with fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomato sauce.<p class="message sent">Yum! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.<p class=message>Me too. But let's focus on our research for now. Have you found any good sources in the library?<p class="message sent">Yes, I found a great book called "Pizza: A Global History" by Carol Helstosky.<p class=message>That's perfect. I'll have to check it out for my own pizza research.<p class="message sent">Definitely do. It's been really helpful for me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=280bf33e-bb37-406d-8b3f-de2c25240a75.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
