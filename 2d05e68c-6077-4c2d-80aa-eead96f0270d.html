We can take turns and compete for the highest score."<p class="message sent">"Excellent! But prepare to lose because I've been practicing my skills."<p class=message>"We'll see about that. Let's get started!"<p class=message>"Wow, you were right B. You really are good at this game."<p class="message sent">"Told you so! But you improved really quickly, I couldn't keep up."<p class=message>"Thanks, I really enjoyed playing with you. We should do this again soon."<p class="message sent">"Definitely.
