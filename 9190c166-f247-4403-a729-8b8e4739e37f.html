Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely! We have a variety of vegetarian options on our menu. Have you tried our veggie dumplings yet?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. They're filled with mushrooms, tofu, and other veggies. They're one of our most popular dishes among vegetarians.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! And what about the stir-fried vegetables?<p class="message sent">Our stir-fried veggies have a mix of different vegetables, like asparagus, broccoli, and peppers. They're a great side dish or can be a main course if you add some tofu.<p class=message>Wow, everything sounds amazing. Can you also recommend a good drink to pair with these dishes?<p class="message sent">Of course. We have a refreshing mocktail made with fresh grapefruit juice and soda, or a non-alcoholic kombucha.<p class=message>I think I'll try the dumplings, stir-fried vegetables, and the grapefruit mocktail then.<p class="message sent">Excellent choice! We'll have that out for you soon. Let me know if you need anything else.<p class=message>This all looks fantastic! The dumplings are so flavorful and the stir-fried vegetables have just the right amount of crunch.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you're enjoying it! Our kitchen takes great care in creating delicious vegetarian dishes that are healthy and satisfying.<p class=message>And the grapefruit mocktail is a perfect complement to the meal. It's not too sweet but still has a tangy kick.<p class="message sent">I'm happy to hear that! We always strive to offer unique and healthy drinks for our customers.<p class=message>I'll definitely recommend this place to my friends who are also vegetarian. Thanks for the great meal and service!<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Thank you for choosing our restaurant and we hope to see you again soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9189dd8e-857b-423e-b532-859c8266e1d4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
