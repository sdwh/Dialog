You got it. And let me tell you, it's no walk in the park.<p class="message sent">Oh really? Is it that difficult to implement?<p class=message>Well, let's just say, if you're not well-versed in security protocols, it's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded!<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds challenging. But what do you think the benefits are of having an ISO 27001 certification?<p class=message>For one, you can sleep soundly at night knowing that your organization's data is safe and secure. Plus, clients and potential customers will trust you more since you've been certified.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. But how often do you have to reevaluate your security measures?<p class=message>Every year! It's like a never-ending cycle of security assessments.<p class="message sent">Haha, it sounds like a Security Assessment Groundhog Day. But I guess in the end, it's worth it to keep the organization secure.<p class=message>Exactly! And hey, if you need any help with the assessments, just give me a call. I'm a self-proclaimed security assessment expert now.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely keep that in mind.
