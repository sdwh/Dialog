Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. Always happy to speak with the media.<p class=message>So, let's start with a fun question. Have you binge-watched any TV shows recently?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have been watching "The Crown" on Netflix. It's quite fascinating to see the inner workings of the monarchy.<p class=message>That's a great choice. Speaking of politics, what is your take on the current political climate?<p class="message sent">Well, it certainly has been interesting. Politics can be a bit unpredictable, but I think it's important for leaders to work towards stability and progress.<p class=message>Agreed. And what about the upcoming elections? Do you have any predictions?<p class="message sent">As a politician, I have to remain neutral. All candidates have their strengths and weaknesses, and it will ultimately be up to the people to decide.<p class=message>Fair enough. Let's switch gears a bit. I heard that you're a big fan of cuisine from around the world. What's your favorite dish?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do love trying new foods. I would have to say my favorite dish is sushi. The flavors and presentation are always impressive.<p class=message>Sushi is delicious. Well, thank you so much for your time, Mr. B. It was great getting to know you a bit better.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It was a pleasure to chat with you as well.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=54e0b748-9722-43d3-849c-d41171913cf7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
