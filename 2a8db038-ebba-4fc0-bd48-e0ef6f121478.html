How about you?<p class=message>I'm feeling great, especially since we get to work together today making delicious treats.<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm excited to see what we can come up with. What kind of pastries were you thinking of making?<p class=message>I thought we could try making some fruit tarts and lemon bars. I have some fresh berries that need to be used up.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. And for coffee, what kind of drinks do you suggest?<p class=message>How about we do a classic cappuccino and a seasonal latte with pumpkin spice flavor for the fall season?<p class="message sent">I love it! Let's get started then. Do you need any help with the pastry dough?<p class=message>Actually, yes. Could you pass me the rolling pin?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. *hands over the rolling pin*<p class=message>Thanks. So how's business been for the coffee shop lately?<p class="message sent">It's been pretty steady, but I think once people catch wind of our new pumpkin spice latte, we'll be even busier.<p class=message>I have no doubt about that. *laughs* Okay, I think the dough is ready. Do you want to start on the espresso shots?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'll start grinding the beans too.<p class=message>Great. Oh, and by the way, did you see the new mural on the side of the building? It looks so cool.<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I was thinking we should take a picture of us and the pastries in front of it for our Instagram.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can even tag the artist.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Sounds like a plan. Alright, I think the espresso shots are done. Did you want to do the milk frothing?<p class=message>Sure thing. I'll get started on that while you pull the shots.<p class="message sent">Got it. We make a great team, don't we?<p class=message>Absolutely. It's fun and rewarding to work with someone who shares the same passion for quality and deliciousness as you do.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. And I also appreciate how you always listen to my ideas and give great feedback.<p class=message>Aww, thank you. It goes both ways. Okay, the frothing is done. Let's assemble the drinks and pastries and get them on display.<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it. I bet our customers are going to love today's specials.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a8d3fbc-7a73-48e5-ba09-eeb88161b251.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
