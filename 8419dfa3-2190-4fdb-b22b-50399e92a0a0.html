Were there any particular presentations that caught your attention?<p class="message sent">Yes, the one on emerging markets really stood out to me. It's exciting to see new opportunities for business development.<p class=message>I agree.

We're currently looking into opportunities in Southeast Asia.<p class=message>Southeast Asia is definitely a region with a lot of potential. What kind of products or services are you planning to offer there?<p class="message sent">We're thinking of focusing on technology and healthcare, which are both growing industries in that region.<p class=message>That sounds like a smart strategy.
