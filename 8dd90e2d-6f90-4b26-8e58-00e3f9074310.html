How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, Doctor A! How about you?<p class=message>I'm feeling a little frazzled, to be honest. We have a lot of patients today, so it's going to be a busy day.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, Doctor A. We'll handle everything as efficiently as possible.<p class=message>You're right, Nurse B. I don't know what I would do without you. You're an amazing nurse.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Doctor A. That means a lot to me. By the way, did you hear about the new coffee shop that opened up down the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't heard about it. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">It's amazing! They have the best lattes and pastries. You should try it sometime.<p class=message>I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the recommendation. By the way, did you see the latest episode of our favorite medical drama last night?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! It was so intense. I can't wait for next week's episode.<p class=message>Me neither. It's one of the few shows that actually gets medical procedures right.<p class="message sent">I know, right? It's refreshing to see a medical show that doesn't exaggerate or simplify medical procedures.<p class=message>Agreed. Anyway, let's get started with the first patient of the day. Are you ready?<p class="message sent">Of course, Doctor A. Let's go help our patients feel better!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8dd3ecd0-0d78-482b-a16b-baa13172ddd8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
