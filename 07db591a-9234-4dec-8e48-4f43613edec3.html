How was your weekend?<p class="message sent message-content">Hi, teacher! My weekend was great. I went hiking with some friends. How about you?<p class="message received message-content">I just relaxed at home and watched some movies. But that sounds like a great way to spend the weekend. Did you take any cool photos?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I did. I posted them on my Instagram if you want to check them out.<p class="message received message-content">That's awesome. I'll make sure to follow you. Now, let's get started with today's lesson. We'll be learning about idiomatic expressions.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, I've heard of those before. They're like phrases that don't mean what they seem, right?<p class="message received message-content">Exactly. For example, "kick the bucket" means to die, but it has nothing to do with buckets or kicking. Do you have any favorite idioms?<p class="message sent message-content">I like "break a leg" because it sounds funny, but it means good luck.<p class="message received message-content">Yes, that's a common one in the theater world. How about "raining cats and dogs"?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, that one's fun too. It means it's raining really hard.<p class="message received message-content">You got it. Now let's practice using some idiomatic expressions in sentences. I'll give you the meaning and you give me the idiom.<p class="message sent message-content">Sure, let's go for it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=07dad2d0-3f89-477e-b58f-795ec1ba7639.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
