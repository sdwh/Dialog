Just trying to finish up this report.<p class=message>Great, anything interesting in it?<p class="message sent">Yeah, actually. Did you know that our company's sales have increased by 20% this quarter?<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive! Maybe we can finally get some new office furniture.<p class="message sent">Ha, yeah. I could use a new chair for sure. Speaking of which, have you seen that new ergonomic model they just released?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it really that comfortable?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's great. I tried it out at a furniture store over the weekend. I felt like I could work for hours without any discomfort.<p class=message>Hmm, I might have to check it out. Hey, have you ever heard of those desk bikes? You can pedal and work at the same time.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. I don't think I could focus on work and pedal at the same time though.<p class=message>I know what you mean. I'd probably end up falling off of it.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, same here. Maybe we'll stick to just doing some stretches at our desks.<p class=message>(laughs) That's probably a safer option. So, what's on the agenda for the rest of the day?<p class="message sent">I still have to make some edits to this report, and then I need to send out some emails. How about you?<p class=message>I have a conference call in 10 minutes, and then I need to work on some designs for a new project.<p class="message sent">Sounds busy, but manageable. We got this.<p class=message>Definitely. And who knows, maybe we'll get some new office furniture soon to make our work even easier.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Here's hoping.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8057f071-64c8-4e03-8f76-dc20637d439e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
