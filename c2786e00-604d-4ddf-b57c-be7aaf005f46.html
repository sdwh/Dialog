What's the weirdest bug you've found?<p class="message sent">Well, it's not weird but it was funny. The software identified a photo of a cat as a human face!<p class=message>Haha, that's hilarious! Did you try it with other animal photos?<p class="message sent">Yes, and it identified a dog as a car.<p class=message>Oh no, that's not useful at all.<p class="message sent">Well, at least it made us laugh. How's the coding coming along?<p class=message>It's going smoothly, I'm just dealing with a stubborn piece of code that doesn't want to cooperate.<p class="message sent">Ah, those are always the worst. Anything you need help with?<p class=message>Actually, could you run a few test cases on this section? I want to make sure it's working properly.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, I'll prioritize it on my to-do list.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. By the way, have you tried that new sushi restaurant down the street?<p class="message sent">Not yet, is it good?<p class=message>Amazing. We should definitely check it out one day.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Speaking of food, did you bring any snacks today? I'm feeling a bit peckish.<p class=message>I did, I have some homemade chocolate chip cookies. Help yourself!<p class="message sent">Yes! You are the best, A.<p class=message>Haha, glad to be of service.
