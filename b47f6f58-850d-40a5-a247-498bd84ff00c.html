Can you help me with that?<p class="message sent">Of course! Let me check if we have the size you need in stock. What size are you looking for?<p class=message>I need a medium size, please.<p class="message sent">I see. Unfortunately, we don't have that size right now. How about a small or a large size instead?<p class=message>Hmm, I don't want it to be too tight or too loose. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class="message sent">Well, we have some similar styles in the women's section. They might fit you better since they run smaller.<p class=message>Oh okay, let's check that out then.<p class="message sent">Great! Would you like me to assist you in the women's section?<p class=message>Yes, please. I appreciate your help.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. This way please.<p class=message>Wow, these women's sizes are so different from men's sizes. How do you even convert them?<p class="message sent">It can be a bit tricky, but generally you need to go up two sizes from men's to women's. So, if you're usually a medium in men's, you might need a large or extra large in women's.<p class=message>That's good to know. Thanks for your help, I found the perfect size!<p class="message sent">Fantastic! I'm glad I could help. Anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>No, that's all for now. Thanks again for your assistance.<p class="message sent">You're welcome!
