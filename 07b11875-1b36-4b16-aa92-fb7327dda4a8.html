Sounds like some kind of secret spy organization.<p class="message received message-content">Haha, no it's actually a standard for information security management. It includes guidelines for encryption methods.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh nice! So does that mean my password is safe from hackers?<p class="message received message-content">Maybe not completely safe, but encryption definitely helps to make it more difficult for hackers to crack it.<p class="message sent message-content">Got it. So what kind of encryption methods are included in ISO 27001?<p class="message received message-content">There are many different methods, including symmetric key encryption, public key encryption, and hashing.<p class="message sent message-content">Wow, that sounds pretty technical. Do I need a PhD in computer science to understand it?<p class="message received message-content">Haha, no not at all. They have lots of resources and guides available online to help you understand it.<p class="message sent message-content">Cool, I'll have to check it out. Do you think ISO 27001 encryption is the best way to keep data secure?<p class="message received message-content">Well, it's definitely a major step in the right direction. But keeping data secure involves many different factors, not just encryption.<p class="message sent message-content">Right, I guess it's important to have a complete information security plan. Thanks for enlightening me on ISO 27001, A.<p class="message received message-content">Anytime, B. Remember, always practice safe computing!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=07ac0b11-1f0f-4b0e-82c1-7032cee60591.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
