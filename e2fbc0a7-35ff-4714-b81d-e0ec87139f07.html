How are you all doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Professor. We're doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thank you. So, today we'll be discussing Shakespeare's "Hamlet".<p class="message sent">Oh, I love that play! The plot is just brilliant.<p class=message>Yes, it really is. Have you seen any adaptations of the play?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've seen a few versions. My favorite one is the movie version with Kenneth Branagh.<p class=message>Ah, yes. That's a good one. Did you know that Branagh has played Hamlet on stage as well?<p class="message sent">No, I didn't. I bet that was quite an experience for the audience.<p class=message>It definitely was. Speaking of experiences, have any of you ever participated in a school play?<p class="message sent">I have, actually. I played the lead role in "The Importance of Being Earnest".<p class=message>Very impressive! Did you have stage fright?<p class="message sent">A little bit, but I managed to pull through. How about you, Professor? Have you ever acted?<p class=message>(laughs) Well, I did play a tree once in a school play.<p class="message sent">(laughs) A tree? That's quite a role!<p class=message>Yes, it was a pivotal character in the play. It had to sway gracefully in the wind.<p class="message sent">Of course, how could I have forgotten? (laughs)<p class=message>Alright, let's get back to "Hamlet". There are so many interpretations of the play. What's your favorite one, B?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough question. I think I like the idea that Hamlet is suffering from mental illness.<p class=message>Yes, that's an interesting take on the character. It adds another layer to his personality.<p class="message sent">Exactly! It makes him more relatable and human, in my opinion.<p class=message>And that's what makes Shakespeare's works so timeless. They're always relevant to our lives.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, Professor. I can't wait to analyze the play further.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e2f72adc-81aa-4864-91a7-544e23f52c10.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
