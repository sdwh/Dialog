I'm looking to apply for a visa to Australia.<p class="message sent">Great! Have you decided on the purpose of your visit?<p class=message>Yes, I'm planning on going for vacation with my family.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a wonderful idea! Have you ever been to Australia before?<p class=message>No, it will be our first time. We're really excited about it!<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Australia offers so many beautiful places to see and things to do. Which part of Australia are you planning to visit?<p class=message>We're thinking of going to Sydney and maybe also visit the Great Barrier Reef.<p class="message sent">Oh, Sydney is a lovely city. You should definitely see the opera house while you're there. And the Great Barrier Reef is simply breathtaking.<p class=message>Yes, we can't wait to go snorkeling! Do we need any special documents for that?<p class="message sent">No, just make sure to bring your swim gear and sunscreen. And of course, your valid passport and visa.<p class=message>That sounds easy enough. How long does the visa process usually take?<p class="message sent">It usually takes around two weeks. But if you need it urgently, we have an express service available for an extra fee.<p class=message>Thanks for letting me know. I think we have enough time to apply for the regular service.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the visa application process?<p class=message>No, not at the moment. This has been very helpful. Thank you so much!<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. I hope you and your family have a fantastic time in Australia!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ff5f04d6-ccba-42bd-a2ff-344d9a57af1d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
