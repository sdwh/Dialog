I hope everyone's weekend was as productive as mine.<p class="message sent">Hi Professor A! I did manage to get some studying in, but I also caught up on some much-needed sleep.<p class=message>Ah, yes. Sleep is important. I actually read an interesting study that says we spend one-third of our lives sleeping.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a lot! Does that mean we're more productive during the remaining two-thirds of our lives?<p class=message>Well, ideally, yes. But if you're anything like me, you probably spend a good portion of that time procrastinating.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Guilty as charged, Professor.<p class=message>(smiling) It's okay, we're all guilty of it from time to time. But speaking of productivity, let's dive into our lesson for today.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, Professor. What are we learning about?<p class=message>We're going to explore the power of positive thinking and how it can impact our overall success in life.<p class="message sent">That sounds intriguing! I'm excited to learn more.<p class=message>Great! But before we do, let's take a quick stretch break to wake our brains up.<p class=message>Alright, let's get started. What are some positive affirmations you tell yourself when you're feeling down?<p class="message sent">(pauses) Hmm, well, I usually tell myself that tomorrow is a new day and that everything will work itself out eventually.<p class=message>That's a great attitude to have. Remember, a positive outlook can go a long way. Now, let's work on some exercises to strengthen our optimistic thinking.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=995cb774-4e80-42ad-8b13-f666260c2d01.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
