How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thanks for asking. I wanted to check in with you about the course progress. How are you finding it?<p class="message sent">So far, it's been challenging but incredibly rewarding. I feel like I'm getting a lot out of it.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Is there anything specific that you're finding especially difficult?<p class="message sent">Honestly, the grammar has been a bit tough for me. But I know it's crucial to learn, so I'm really trying to push myself.<p class=message>Definitely. And just remember, we've got plenty of resources to help you out with that. Have you been practicing your speaking and listening?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been trying to listen to a lot of English podcasts and practicing with my roommate.<p class=message>That's fantastic! It's great to hear that you're being proactive about practicing. Keep it up!<p class="message sent">Thanks. Is there anything coming up in the course that I should be aware of?<p class=message>Yes, we've got a midterm coming up in a couple of weeks. But don't worry, we'll be reviewing extensively beforehand so you should be well-prepared.<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds good. Thanks for the heads up.<p class=message>No problem. And in the meantime, if you have any questions or need any extra help, don't hesitate to reach out to me or the other tutors.<p class="message sent">Will do.
