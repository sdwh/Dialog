I'm so excited to be working with you today.<p class="message sent">Me too! Especially since we get to work in this beautiful coffee shop. Have you tried the coffee here?<p class=message>Not yet, but I heard it's amazing. Speaking of drinks, what's your favorite type of coffee to pair with desserts?<p class="message sent">I think a medium roast works nicely with most desserts. And you?<p class=message>I'm a big fan of espresso with my desserts - it really brings out the flavors.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. What are you making today?<p class=message>I'm working on a lemon lavender tart with a shortbread crust. What about you?<p class="message sent">I'm brewing some Ethiopan Yirgacheffe - it has a fruity taste that I think will pair well with your tart.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! Do you have any favorite coffee brewing methods?<p class="message sent">Personally, I love the Chemex. It just makes the coffee taste so clean and smooth.<p class=message>That's great to know. I'll have to try it out sometime. Hey, speaking of trying things out - would you like to try a piece of my tart when it's done?<p class="message sent">Of course! And hey, once we're done for the day, maybe we can exchange some of our own personal recipes.<p class=message>I'd love that. It's always great to learn from other professionals. Speaking of professionals, here comes a customer!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=03b05cb2-d62e-45fa-9acf-5f6b403c0cc2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
