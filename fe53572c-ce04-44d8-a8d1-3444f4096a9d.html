Sounds like a breakfast cereal brand, doesn't it?<p class=message>Haha, yeah, it kind of does. But it's actually a serious matter.<p class="message sent">I know, I know. It's just that the name makes it hard to take seriously.<p class=message>Speaking of breakfast, what do you think the hackers had for breakfast that day?<p class="message sent">Hopefully not our passwords with a side of our social security numbers!<p class=message>Haha, true. But hopefully they had a bad cup of coffee that made them commit a mistake and get caught.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And maybe they'll end up taking an online course on cyber ethics as their punishment.<p class=message>Ha, that would be a great idea! It's always good to turn a negative into a positive.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And speaking of positives, maybe this incident will remind us all to keep our passwords safe and secure.<p class=message>Yes, let's hope so. And next time we hear the words ISO 27001, we'll think of breakfast cereal with a side of cyber security.<p class="message sent">Ha, sounds like a plan! Let's just make sure not to add any milk to that cereal bowl.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fe50696c-ddf6-42b8-a488-09bb4d0dd4b4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
