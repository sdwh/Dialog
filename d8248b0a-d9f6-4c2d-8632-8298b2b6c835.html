How's it going?<p class="message sent">Pretty good, thanks for asking. Where are you headed?<p class=message>I'm on my way to Atlanta for a conference. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm just doing my rounds. Just dropped someone off at the airport and now I'm heading back towards the center.<p class=message>That's nice. Have you been driving for a long time?<p class="message sent">Yeah, for about 10 years now. It's been good. I enjoy the flexibility it offers.<p class=message>That's cool. Did you always want to be a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Actually, no. I wanted to be a pilot but due to some personal circumstances, I had to drop out of flight school.<p class=message>Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. But it's good to hear that you found something you enjoy doing.<p class="message sent">Yes, I completely agree. By the way, are you excited about the conference you're attending?<p class=message>Yes, definitely! There are going to be some really interesting speakers and workshops.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. It's always good to learn something new. I'm sure you'll have a blast.<p class=message>I hope so. Hey, do you have a favorite spot in Atlanta that you would recommend me checking out while I'm there?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely the World of Coca-Cola. You get to learn about the history of the company and sample all of their different types of drinks.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds really interesting. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class="message sent">No problem. Hey, we're here. Have a great time at the conference!<p class=message>Thanks, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d82037b5-cd5e-4488-9efa-7ff0879661b0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
