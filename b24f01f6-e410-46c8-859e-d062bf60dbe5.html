It's supposed to be pretty strict, right?<p class=message>Yeah, but it's also an amazing way to keep our data and systems secure. It's like having a fortress protecting us.<p class="message sent">Hey, you're right. With that level of security, we could even protect ourselves from zombie attacks.<p class=message>Haha, I don't know about that. But we can definitely protect ourselves from cyber attacks and hackers.<p class="message sent">So, what are the basic requirements for a company to obtain the ISO 27001 certification?<p class=message>Well, it's basically like having an organized approach towards managing information security risks.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great idea. After all, we don't want our sensitive data like passwords and personal information to get into the wrong hands.<p class=message>Exactly! And the best part is that the ISO 27001 standard is widely recognized, so it can help us in establishing trust with our clients and stakeholders.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. So, what do we need to start with?<p class=message>We need to conduct a risk assessment, identify our security objectives and design a plan accordingly.<p class="message sent">This sounds like a lot of work, but it's worth it in the end.<p class=message>Yes! With a strong security management plan in place, we can confidently say that our company is cyber-secure.<p class="message sent">I totally agree. Let's start working on this security management plan and make sure our data is as safe as the president's secret briefcase.<p class=message>Haha, you got that right, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b24a78db-c948-422b-9ebc-6eaad141d04f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
