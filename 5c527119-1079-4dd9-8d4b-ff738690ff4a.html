How's it going with the ISO 27001 audit plan?<p class="message sent">It's going fine, just trying to figure out the best way to approach it.<p class=message>I know what you mean! It can be tricky, but I find it helpful to start with a checklist of all the requirements.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea, but it can also be overwhelming. How do you prioritize what to focus on first?<p class=message>One thing I like to do is identify the high-risk areas and deal with those first.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. But what about the low-risk areas? Do we just ignore them?<p class=message>Not at all! I like to give them a quick check to make sure they're still compliant, but I don't spend as much time on them.<p class="message sent">Got it. It's all about finding the right balance.<p class=message>Exactly! And remember, we're here to help the company improve their information security, not just check off boxes.<p class="message sent">Yes, and speaking of improvement, what about making recommendations for areas that need improvement?<p class=message>Definitely! We should highlight any non-conformities and suggest ways to address them.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And let's not forget to celebrate when we find areas that are already doing well!<p class=message>Absolutely! Positive reinforcement is just as important as pointing out areas for improvement.<p class="message sent">This is exactly why I love working with you. You always have a balanced approach and can make even the most tedious tasks fun.<p class=message>Aww, thank you! We'll make sure to rock this audit plan together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5c4b84bb-d950-456b-bfcf-a5396eaa1fca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
