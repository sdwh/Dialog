How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! Not bad, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well too. So, we've got a website to improve, huh?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it seems so. What do you think is the most urgent problem we need to address?<p class=message>Hmm, I think the navigation is quite confusing. Maybe we can come up with a more intuitive menu.<p class="message sent">Good point. I also noticed that the loading speed is not up to par. Perhaps we should optimize the code.<p class=message>Agreed. And speaking of the code, we should make sure it's compatible with different browsers and devices.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And while we're at it, maybe we can add some animations to make the site more engaging.<p class=message>Yes, that's an excellent idea. We don't want the site to look too plain.<p class="message sent">Another thing we can do is to make sure the site is accessible to users with disabilities.<p class=message>Absolutely. We should aim for inclusiveness. Oh, and did you notice that the site is not mobile-friendly?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. We need to make sure it's responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.<p class=message>And we should make sure the site is optimized for search engines so that it's easier to find.<p class="message sent">Right. We don't want the site to be buried among the millions of other websites out there.<p class=message>Well, I think that's quite a list of things we need to do!<p class="message sent">Sure is, but I think we can handle it. We make a pretty good team, don't you think?<p class=message>Absolutely! I'm confident we'll come up with something great.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=502e0148-8b47-47c7-a91c-8cc4b374add1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
