Are you the soy milk and pancake vendor here?<p class="message sent">That's right! I'm the soy milk vendor, and he is the pancake vendor. Do you want to try our Chinese-style breakfast today?<p class=message>Yes, please! I heard your pancakes are crispy and chewy at the same time, and your soy milk is rich and creamy.<p class="message sent">You heard right! Our pancakes are freshly made and filled with savory scallion or sesame paste. And our soy milk is made from organic soybeans and has a mild sweetness.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! Can you teach me how to make pancakes like that?<p class="message sent">Sure, I can give you some tips. First, you need to knead the dough until it's elastic, then roll it out and fold it several times to make layers. Then fry it for a few minutes until it's golden brown.<p class=message>Wow, it sounds simple, but I bet it's not easy to make it perfect. What about your soy milk? How do you make it?<p class="message sent">It's also simple, but requires some patience. First, soak the soybeans overnight, then grind them into a fine paste. Then boil the paste with water, strain it, and sweeten it with some sugar or honey.<p class=message>That makes sense. I guess it's important to use high-quality ingredients and take your time to make a good breakfast. Thank you for sharing your secrets with me.<p class="message sent">No problem! We love to share our passion for traditional Chinese breakfast with everyone. It's a way to connect with our roots and spread joy.<p class=message>I totally agree! Nothing beats a good breakfast to start the day right. I can't wait to taste your pancakes and soy milk.<p class="message sent">Here you go! Enjoy your breakfast, and let us know how you like it.<p class=message>Mmm, it's delicious! The pancakes are crispy and chewy, and the soy milk is so creamy and flavorful. I feel like I'm in China!<p class="message sent">Haha, thank you! We take pride in our food and love to hear your positive feedback. Have a great day!<p class=message>You too! I'll come back soon for more pancakes and soy milk. This is the best breakfast I've had in a long time.<p class="message sent">Glad to hear that! See you next time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1fc03ad7-2cd0-4472-a02d-0bbde1465840.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
