My luggage is missing.<p class="message sent">Uh-oh, that's not good. Let me see what I can do to help. Can you tell me more about your luggage?<p class=message>Yes, it's a black suitcase with a red ribbon tied around the handle. It's about medium-sized.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll make a report and we'll try our best to locate it. In the meantime, can I offer you anything to ease your discomfort?<p class=message>Yes, a cup of coffee would be nice. Thank you.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, I'll get you a cup of fresh coffee right away. Would you like anything else? A newspaper, perhaps?<p class=message>No, just the coffee is fine. Thanks.<p class="message sent">Here you go, one delicious cup of coffee. Did you happen to pack any souvenirs or priceless items in your luggage?<p class=message>No, nothing too important. Just my clothes and toiletries.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. We'll do everything in our power to find your suitcase, and if we can't, we'll reimburse you for your lost items.<p class=message>Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. I hope you have a delightful trip starting from now on.<p class=message>You've been amazing, thank you again.<p class="message sent">No problem, it's all part of the job.
