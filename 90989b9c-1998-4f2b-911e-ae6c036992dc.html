What's that?<p class=message>They're like corn cakes that are super popular in South America. You can fill them up with all sorts of yummy stuff.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. What kind of fillings do people usually put in them?<p class=message>Oh man, the possibilities are endless! Some people go for savory fillings like cheese, meat, or avocado, while others go for sweet fillings like chocolate spread or jam.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like a versatile snack. Where can I find them?<p class=message>I heard there's a food truck that sells them downtown. We should check it out sometime.<p class="message sent">Definitely! I'm always down to try new foods. Have you had any memorable arepas experiences?<p class=message>Yeah, I remember trying one for the first time when I was in Colombia. The one I had was stuffed with shredded beef and topped with a spicy sauce. It was so good!<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. I gotta try that one for sure. Do you know how to make them at home?<p class=message>I actually do! My mom taught me how to make them, and it's super easy. We should have a cook-off sometime and make arepas.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a fun idea! I'm down for it. But just a fair warning, I'm going to make the best arepas ever.<p class=message>(laughing) We'll see about that. But in all seriousness, arepas are a great way to try new flavors and cuisines. I can't wait to introduce more people to them.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Thanks for telling me about them, I can't wait to give them a try.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=908e29c7-9055-4ac5-9e9b-e496e2eb3d03.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
