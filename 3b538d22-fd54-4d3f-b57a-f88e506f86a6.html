I have a headache and a cough.<p class=message>Okay, let's take your temperature and blood pressure first. Have you been taking any medication?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't taken anything yet. I wanted to see if it would go away on its own.<p class=message>I understand, but it's best to take some medicine to help reduce your symptoms. I'll write you a prescription.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate that. So, what do you think is causing my headache and cough?<p class=message>It could be a cold or a mild infection. There's a flu going around too, so we should do a quick test to check if that's the case.<p class="message sent">Alright, that's fine by me. Is the test painful?<p class=message>No, it's just a swab inside your nose. It may feel a bit uncomfortable, but it's over quickly.<p class="message sent">Okay, I can handle that. By the way, I saw on social media that they're coming out with a new vaccine for COVID-19. Have you heard anything about it?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's still in development, but it looks promising. Once it's approved, we'll be able to administer it to our patients.<p class="message sent">That's great news. Do you think it will be effective?<p class=message>Based on the studies and trials so far, it seems like it will be. But only time will tell.<p class="message sent">I see. Thanks for letting me know. I really appreciate your help and advice.<p class=message>Of course, that's what I'm here for. Just make sure to take your medication as prescribed and rest up. You'll feel better soon enough.<p class="message sent">Thanks again. Have a good day!<p class=message>You too, take care.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3b52247f-03a3-4a83-af04-434fd3560ec7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
