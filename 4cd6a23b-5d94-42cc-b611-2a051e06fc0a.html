How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, can't complain. Just trying to make sure everything is running smoothly here at the restaurant.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, have you tried our new dish, the carne asada tacos? They're getting great feedback from customers.<p class=message>Yes, I actually had them for lunch yesterday. I agree, they are delicious!<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to check out the new mural on the wall near the bar area?<p class=message>No, I haven't had a chance yet. What's it all about?<p class="message sent">It's a beautiful painting of cultural icons from Mexico, such as Frida Kahlo and Pancho Villa. It really adds to the ambiance of the restaurant.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. We really try to provide an authentic Mexican experience for our customers.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I think it's what sets us apart from other Mexican restaurants in the area.<p class=message>Hey, have you noticed that the mariachi band we hired for Friday night cancelled?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm aware of that. I'll see if I can find a replacement quickly.<p class=message>Thanks, B. You always come through in a pinch.<p class="message sent">It's all part of the job. So, any plans for the weekend?<p class=message>Not yet, but I was thinking of checking out the River Walk. I heard it's really beautiful this time of year.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. The weather should be perfect for it.<p class=message>You don't have any recommendations for a good spot to grab some margaritas, do you?<p class="message sent">Of course I do! I recommend the Pearl Brewery. They have a great outdoor patio and some of the best margaritas around.<p class=message>Sounds perfect. Thanks, B!<p class="message sent">No problem. I'll make sure to let you know if I hear back from any mariachi bands, by the way.<p class=message>That would be great. Thanks again, B. See you later!<p class="message sent">See ya!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4cd55fd8-000d-48b0-8b97-6afa9c9e1fa9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
