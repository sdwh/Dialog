What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Can I have a cappuccino, please?<p class=message>Sure thing, coming right up! Is this for here or to-go?<p class="message sent">I'm actually meeting a friend here, so for here, please.<p class=message>Great! Would you like anything else? Maybe a pastry or a sandwich?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me see. How about a croissant?<p class=message>Excellent choice! We just baked a fresh batch this morning. Would you like it warmed up?<p class="message sent">Yes, please, that would be perfect!<p class=message>Alright, cappuccino and croissant, coming right up. Anything else while you wait?<p class="message sent">No, thank you. I'm excited to try your cappuccino though. I heard it's one of the best in town.<p class=message>That's so great to hear! We take pride in our coffee here. I hope you enjoy it!<p class="message sent">I'm sure I will. So, how did you become a barista?<p class=message>It's actually quite a funny story. I used to work in finance, but I realized that I was more passionate about coffee. So, I quit my job and pursued my dream of becoming a barista.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive! It takes a lot of courage to make such a big career change.<p class=message>It was definitely scary at first, but I'm glad I took the leap. I love what I do, and it's so rewarding to see customers enjoy their coffee.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. I think it's important to follow your passions, even if it means taking a risk.<p class=message>Absolutely. Life is too short to not do what you love. And speaking of love, here's your cappuccino and croissant. Enjoy!<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, it looks and smells amazing.<p class=message>You're welcome, let me know if you need anything else. And have a great time catching up with your friend!<p class="message sent">Will do, thanks again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed276f3d-4c7c-44bb-9bb9-ad24565d6213.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
