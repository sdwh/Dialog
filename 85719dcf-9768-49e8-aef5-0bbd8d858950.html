I think I've fixed the engine issue on the tractor.<p class=message>That's good to hear. By the way, have you heard the one about the farmer who became a magician?<p class="message sent">No, what's the story?<p class=message>He turned his hay into gold!<p class="message sent">*laughs* That's a good one! Speaking of hay, I noticed that the baler machine needs some new tires.<p class=message>Yeah, I've been meaning to get to that. Did you know that the first tires were made of iron and were very uncomfortable to ride on?<p class="message sent">I had no idea. Luckily, these days we have much better options. Should I go ahead and order some new tires?<p class=message>Sounds good to me. In the meantime, let me know if you need any help with the welding job on the plow.<p class="message sent">Will do. And hey, did you hear about the scarecrow who won an award?<p class=message>No, what award did he win?<p class="message sent">The Nobel prize, for being outstanding in his field!<p class=message>*laughs* You really are on a roll today. Well, let's get back to work before the boss starts chasing after us.<p class="message sent">Right. But before that, do you mind telling me another joke?<p class=message>Sure, why was the math book sad?<p class="message sent">I don't know, why?<p class=message>Because it had too many problems!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=857132c4-57ca-4a07-aece-a70e15c58994.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
