Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. Always happy to chat with the media.<p class=message>So, let's start with the question on everyone's mind - can you give us any hints about your plans for the upcoming election?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Sorry, A, no spoilers just yet. But I can promise you it'll be an exciting campaign.<p class=message>Well, I guess we'll have to keep our eyes peeled. On a lighter note, I heard you're quite the foodie. What's your favorite dish?<p class="message sent">Oh, I love trying new cuisines. But if I had to pick a favorite, it would have to be pizza. Can't go wrong with a classic margherita.<p class=message>Interesting choice! Have you ever tried pineapple on your pizza?<p class="message sent">(chuckles) I have, and while I appreciate the creativity, I'm more of a purist when it comes to my toppings.<p class=message>Fair enough. Now, onto a more serious topic - what steps are you taking to address the issue of climate change in our community?<p class="message sent">As an elected official, I believe it's our responsibility to prioritize environmental protection. We've implemented several initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and increase sustainability. But we can always do more, and I'm committed to finding new solutions to this pressing issue.<p class=message>That's great to hear. And finally, since we're in such an iconic city, do you have a favorite landmark or attraction here?<p class="message sent">Definitely the skyline. There's something about seeing those towering buildings against the blue sky that never gets old. But I also love visiting the museums - this city has such a rich history and culture.<p class=message>Agreed, there's always something new to discover. Thank you so much for your time today, Mr. B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It was a pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=efb5367e-a339-4e8c-b440-a27b0a8935ef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
