Hey, while we're on the topic of makeup, have you ever tried concealer?<p class="message sent">I have, but I'm not exactly sure how to use it properly.<p class=message>No worries, I can give you some tips! First, you want to choose a shade that matches your skin tone. Then, apply it in small dots under your eyes and blend it in with a sponge or your fingers.<p class="message sent">I'll have to give that a try next time I'm doing my makeup. Thanks for the advice!<p class=message>No problem! It's always fun to learn new things. Speaking of which, have you tried any new restaurants lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually!
