How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning Doctor A. Honestly, I still feel a bit dizzy and weak.<p class=message>I see. Have you been taking the medication I prescribed?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have, but it doesn't seem to be working.<p class=message>Well, the medication will take time to work, but in the meantime, you should try to eat a healthy meal and get some rest.<p class="message sent">That's easier said than done. I've been so busy with work and I have hardly slept in days.<p class=message>I understand, but your health should always come first. Maybe you should take a break from work for a few days.<p class="message sent">But who will take care of everything?<p class=message>Don't worry, you can delegate your task to your colleagues or someone close to you. Your well-being is important, and you can always catch up on work later.<p class="message sent">Hmmm, you're right. I'll consider taking a few days off.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. And if you ever need someone to talk to or vent to, just know that I'm here for you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Doctor. You're such a helpful and caring person.<p class=message>It's all part of my job. I just want to see you get better and back to your routine. In the meantime, take care and follow your treatment plan.<p class="message sent">Thanks again, Doctor. I'll do my best.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f1d4d48-85b9-4f92-9638-51277b3200cc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
