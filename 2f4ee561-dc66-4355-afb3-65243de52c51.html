I'm excited to explore this market and pick out some fresh ingredients for our meal.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I have some great spots to show you that will really give you a taste of the local cuisine.<p class=message>Fantastic, let's get started. What's the first thing we should look for?<p class="message sent">I highly recommend trying some of the fresh seafood here. The prawns and mussels are particularly popular.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let's add those to our shopping list. What about vegetables?<p class="message sent">You can't go wrong with some fresh greens for a salad. And maybe some sweet potatoes for a side dish.<p class=message>Great suggestions. I'm also curious about the spices and seasonings they use in this region. Any favorites?<p class="message sent">For sure! You have to try the peri-peri seasoning. It's a mix of hot chilies, garlic, and more. You can find it in most of the shops here.<p class=message>That sounds like a must-try. Alright, we have our ingredients. Let's head back and get cooking.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'll let you take the lead in the kitchen, but I'm happy to help with anything you need.<p class=message>Thanks for the offer. Let's start with the prawns. We'll grill them up and sprinkle some peri-peri seasoning on top.<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic. And what about the mussels?<p class=message>We'll steam them with some white wine, butter, and garlic. And for the sides, we'll roast the sweet potatoes and toss the salad with a simple vinaigrette.<p class="message sent">You really know your way around the kitchen, A. This is going to be a delicious meal.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I couldn't have done it without your help picking out the freshest ingredients. Let's eat!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2f4d9c47-67de-4529-a408-0871f616af03.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
