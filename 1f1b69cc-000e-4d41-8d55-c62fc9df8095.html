I heard you're the go-to person when it comes to automated testing. Can you give me some tips?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! What kind of testing are you working on?<p class=message>We're currently doing manual testing on our software, but we're looking to move onto automated testing to speed things up.<p class="message sent">I see. Well, the first step is to identify which areas are most important to automate. Have you done any analysis on that?<p class=message>Not yet, but I think we should start with the high-risk areas first.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. It's also important to choose the right tools for the job. There are many options out there, but not all of them will work for your specific needs.<p class=message>Any suggestions on which tools to use?<p class="message sent">For UI testing, I recommend Selenium. For API testing, I like using Postman. But again, it depends on your project requirements.<p class=message>Got it. And once we've identified the areas to automate and the tools to use, what's next?<p class="message sent">You'll need to write scripts that simulate user behavior and verify the expected outcomes. It can take some time to get the scripts just right, but once they're up and running, they'll save you a lot of time in the long run.<p class=message>That makes sense. I'm excited to try out automated testing and see how it works for us.<p class="message sent">It's definitely worth a try. And if you ever run into any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to me for help.<p class=message>Thanks, B! I really appreciate it. You're a lifesaver.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, A. We're all on the same team here, and I'm always happy to help out a colleague.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f18c6a4-7f94-4401-a690-a67bead50e8a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
