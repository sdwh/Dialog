Are you ready for our road trip to Gold Coast?<p class="message sent">Yes, ma'am! I'm excited to show you around the beautiful Gold Coast.<p class=message>I heard that there are plenty of theme parks and beach resorts there. Which ones do you recommend visiting?<p class="message sent">Definitely visit Dreamworld, Sea World, and Movie World! And for the beaches, Surfer's Paradise is a must-visit.<p class=message>Great recommendations! By the way, have you driven on the left side of the road before?<p class="message sent">Yes, ma'am, I'm used to it. But please remind me if I'm accidentally on the right side.<p class=message>Haha, sure thing. By the way, have you ever encountered any interesting passengers before?<p class="message sent">Well, there was one time when a passenger asked me to drive him to the moon! I had to explain that it's not possible.<p class=message>(laughing) That's hilarious! Speaking of the moon, have you seen the recent full moon? It was so beautiful.<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! It was so bright that it felt like daytime.<p class=message>That's true! Anyway, do you have any favorite songs that you like to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love listening to classic rock like AC/DC or Led Zeppelin. What about you?<p class=message>I love pop music, especially Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande.<p class="message sent">Nice! We can definitely listen to some of their songs during our trip.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! How far are we from Gold Coast now?<p class="message sent">We're about halfway there. We should arrive in a few hours.<p class=message>Perfect! I can't wait to enjoy the theme parks and the beaches.<p class="message sent">Me too! It's going to be an amazing trip.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6a72d553-945c-4276-8252-cf5a5c000477.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
