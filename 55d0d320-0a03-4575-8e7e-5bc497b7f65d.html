It's nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm a photographer from New York. I'm excited to learn how to make traditional wagashi here in Kyoto.<p class=message>Me too! I've always been fascinated by Japanese cuisine, and wagashi is a unique and beautiful artform.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Do you have any experience making wagashi before?<p class=message>No, but I've seen some demonstrations and read a lot about the process. It's very delicate and requires a lot of precision.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. As a photographer, I also appreciate the visual appeal of wagashi. The colors and shapes are so captivating.<p class=message>Yes, presentation is a big part of wagashi. It's meant to be not only delicious, but also aesthetically pleasing.<p class="message sent">That's why I'm excited to take some photos of our finished products! It will be a fun challenge to capture the beauty of wagashi.<p class=message>Definitely! And as a chef, I'm excited to experiment with different flavor combinations and techniques. The possibilities for creativity are endless.<p class="message sent">I agree. I love how cooking and photography are both creative fields that require a mix of skill, knowledge, and experimentation.<p class=message>It's also interesting how both fields are influenced by local culture and traditions. Learning about wagashi is a great way to immerse ourselves in Japanese history and customs.<p class="message sent">Yes, I think it's important to appreciate and learn from different cultures. That's why I'm traveling around the world and documenting my experiences through photography.<p class=message>And I'm grateful to have the opportunity to travel and learn new culinary techniques. It's a great way to expand my skills and knowledge as a chef.<p class="message sent">It's wonderful that we can both pursue our passions and share our experiences with others. Maybe we can even collaborate in the future and create a book or exhibition about wagashi.<p class=message>That would be amazing! I'm already imagining the beautiful photos and recipes we could create together.<p class="message sent">Me too! Let's focus on perfecting our skills for now, and maybe one day we can bring wagashi to a wider audience.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's get started on our lesson and make some delicious and beautiful wagashi!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=55ce20f1-3c45-48fd-8973-af53d502ab59.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
