How's it going?<p class="message sent message-content">Hey A, yeah it's been a challenge. But I am trying to integrate machine learning into it.<p class="message received message-content">Wow, machine learning eh? Isn't that a bit too much?<p class="message sent message-content">Not at all. It uses algorithms to analyze data and make predictions. It can save a lot of time on testing.<p class="message received message-content">Interesting. But what if the machine makes a mistake?<p class="message sent message-content">Well, I have trained it on a lot of data to minimize errors. It's also able to learn from mistakes and improve itself.<p class="message received message-content">Impressive. So, what kind of testing are you automating?<p class="message sent message-content">Functional testing, regression testing, and performance testing. It's a lot of work.<p class="message received message-content">I can imagine. But hey, at least it's not boring, right?<p class="message sent message-content">True that. It's like being a detective, trying to find bugs and fix them.<p class="message received message-content">Haha, I like that analogy. Do you think automation testing will replace manual testing in the future?<p class="message sent message-content">It already is in many cases. But there will always be a need for manual testing, especially for exploratory testing.<p class="message received message-content">That's a relief for us humans. Anyway, thanks for sharing. I learned a lot today.<p class="message sent message-content">You're welcome. It's always good to share knowledge and learn from each other.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0dcb5874-ea53-4506-a3da-18ffd263d06c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
