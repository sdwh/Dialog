Thanks for agreeing to chat with me today. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you to this event?<p class="message sent">Of course! I'm actually one of the vendors here selling handmade pottery. I love this event because I get to connect with so many people who appreciate handmade goods.<p class=message>That's really cool! Do you have a favorite piece that you've made?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough one. I put so much love and effort into each piece, but there's one mug that's always been a crowd favorite. It's got a cute little owl design on it.<p class=message>Aw, I love owls. Speaking of animals, does your love of pottery extend to any other artistic hobbies?<p class="message sent">You know, I've been thinking about getting into glassblowing. It looks like such a fascinating and intricate craft.<p class=message>Oh wow, that definitely sounds like a challenge. But I bet you could make some amazing pieces. So, did you always know that you wanted to be a potter?<p class="message sent">Actually, no. I was studying to be a nurse, but once I started taking pottery classes, I was hooked. There's just something about creating something from scratch that's so satisfying.<p class=message>That's really cool that you followed your passion. Well, I won't keep you from your customers any longer. Thanks again for chatting with me!<p class="message sent">No problem! Thanks for stopping by.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1de9d93e-3ebe-4291-ae80-43a72a4ce4c9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
