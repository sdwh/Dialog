How's everything going with the database?<p class="message sent">Everything's good so far, A. We've been keeping track of all the necessary updates and communicating with the IT team regularly.<p class=message>That's great to hear. As you know, we're here to conduct an ISO 27001 audit. Can you walk me through the measures you've taken to ensure data security?<p class="message sent">Of course. We've implemented strict access controls and regularly back up all of our data. We also encrypt sensitive information and conduct regular vulnerability scans.<p class=message>Those are all important steps. On a more lighthearted note, what's the funniest or most interesting data entry you've ever seen?<p class="message sent">(laughs) I once came across a customer who had listed their name as "Fuzzy Bunny." It definitely made me do a double-take.<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious. Have you ever encountered any serious data breaches?<p class="message sent">Thankfully no, but we always have to be vigilant and prepared in case it does happen. It's a constant balance between convenience and security.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's better to be safe than sorry. Have you seen any interesting trends in the data we've collected?<p class="message sent">Well, we've noticed a significant increase in online sales over the past few months, which is definitely an interesting trend to watch.<p class=message>That's definitely worth keeping an eye on. Thanks for all the information, B. Let's wrap up this audit and grab some lunch.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, A. I know a great burger joint down the street if you're interested.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=48ca6834-5a92-4077-985f-65aeed86ad8b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
