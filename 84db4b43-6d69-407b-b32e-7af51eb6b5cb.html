I'm a big fan of Japanese cuisine, and I was wondering what kind of dishes you have here.<p class="message sent">Hello! We have a great selection of dishes from Japan. We have sushi, which is a type of rice dish with various toppings. We also have sashimi, which is raw fish sliced thinly and served with soy sauce and wasabi.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. What else do you have?<p class="message sent">We also have donburi, which is a bowl of rice topped with meat, vegetables, and egg. Our tempura is also very popular - it's a deep-fried dish typically made with seafood or vegetables.<p class=message>Yum, my mouth is watering already. Do you have any ramen?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have several types of ramen. Our most popular is the tonkotsu ramen, which is a rich pork bone broth with noodles, pork belly, and other toppings.<p class=message>That sounds perfect for a cozy night in. Can you recommend any drinks to go with these dishes?<p class="message sent">Of course! We have a selection of Japanese sake, as well as beer and cocktails. Our plum wine is also very popular.<p class=message>I might just have to try everything on the menu! Thank you for your recommendations.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=84da7726-42e0-41e2-b4a2-b0c38cfd52d8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
