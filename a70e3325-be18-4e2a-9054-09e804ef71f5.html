How are you today?<p class="message sent">Morning! I'm doing great. How about you?<p class=message>I'm fantastic, thanks for asking. Have you seen our fresh vegetables and fruits yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They look amazing. Are they all grown locally?<p class=message>Absolutely! All of our produce is grown right here in the Champagne region.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. What types of vegetables do you have?<p class=message>We have all sorts of vegetables, from colorful bell peppers and zucchinis to leafy greens like lettuce and spinach.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect for my stall. Do you have any recommendations for what would sell well?<p class=message>Our cherry tomatoes are always a hit. They're juicy and flavorful, and people can't resist snacking on them.<p class="message sent">Hmm. I don't usually sell tomatoes, but I might make an exception for those. How much do they cost?<p class=message>They're â‚¬2.50 per kilo. A bargain for something so fresh and delicious!<p class="message sent">That's a great deal. I'll take 10 kilos, please.<p class=message>Wonderful! I'll have them packed up for you. Anything else you're interested in?<p class="message sent">Yes, can you tell me more about these purple carrots? I've never seen anything like them.<p class=message>They're a rare variety that we grow ourselves. They're just as sweet as regular carrots, but they have a beautiful deep purple color that's perfect for adding a pop of color to salads or stir-fries.<p class="message sent">Amazing! I'll take a few bunches of those as well. Thank you so much!<p class=message>It's our pleasure. Thank you for supporting local agriculture. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a70c9c76-a4f3-48ac-b834-f837e079a81f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
