I am a reporter for the Daily News. May I ask if you have a few minutes to answer some questions?<p class="message sent">Of course, what can I help you with?<p class=message>Well, I noticed you are doing some unique artwork. Can you tell me about it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I create sculptures out of recycled materials. It's my way of helping the environment and expressing my creativity.<p class=message>That's interesting. What inspired you to do this?<p class="message sent">I've always been passionate about the environment and I also love making things with my hands. So, I combined both my interests and it just came naturally to me.<p class=message>That’s impressive! What materials have you used for your artwork?<p class="message sent">I use anything from scrap metal, old furniture, and even broken toys. I try to find materials that people normally throw away and give them new life.<p class=message>It sounds like you are quite resourceful.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I try my best.<p class=message>With your passion for environmental conservation and skills for creating artwork, do you have any future plans for your art?<p class="message sent">Yes, I hope to have an exhibition of my work one day and raise awareness for the importance of recycling.<p class=message>That’s wonderful. Do you have a favorite piece of work that you’ve created?<p class="message sent">It's hard to pick one, but I'm especially proud of my latest creation that was made from old bicycle chains.<p class=message>I can’t wait to see it. Thank you so much for your time and sharing your art with us.<p class="message sent">It’s been a pleasure, thank you for your interest!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=250b813b-4679-44b7-a11d-df77127d17c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
