My name is John. Where are you headed?<p class=message>I am going to Shanghai for business. How about you? What brings you here?<p class="message sent">I live in Shanghai, but I'm originally from Hong Kong. How do you like Shanghai so far?<p class=message>This is actually my first time here. The city is so big and busy!<p class="message sent">Yes, it can be overwhelming at first, but it has a lot to offer. Have you tried the local cuisine yet?<p class=message>Not yet, do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">You have to try the xiaolongbao! It's a type of steamed dumpling with soup inside.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll definitely try it.<p class="message sent">You should also visit the Bund at night. The view of the skyline is breathtaking.<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestion! How long have you been a taxi driver in Shanghai?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for almost 10 years now. It's always interesting meeting new people like you.<p class=message>That's great. You must have seen a lot of changes in the city over the years.<p class="message sent">Yes, Shanghai is always evolving. It's exciting to see what the future holds.<p class=message>I agree.
