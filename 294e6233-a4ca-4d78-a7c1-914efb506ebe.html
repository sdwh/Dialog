How was your morning?<p class="message sent">Hi A! It was good. I had a great workout at the gym. What about you?<p class=message>Just a typical morning for me. Rushing to get ready and grabbing a cup of coffee on the go.<p class="message sent">I know the feeling. Speaking of coffee, have you tried this caf√©'s latte?<p class=message>I haven't, but it looks delicious. Maybe I'll order one with my lunch.<p class="message sent">Definitely do! The foam is so thick and creamy. It's like drinking a cloud.<p class=message>Haha, that sounds amazing. What are you thinking of ordering for lunch?<p class="message sent">I'm torn between the Caesar salad and the chicken sandwich. How about you?<p class=message>I'm in the mood for something hearty, so I might try the burger.<p class="message sent">Good choice! Their burgers are top-notch. Hey, did you hear we have a new coworker starting next week?<p class=message>No way! Who is it?<p class="message sent">His name is John. Apparently, he used to work at a fancy restaurant in Paris.<p class=message>Oh, la la! Maybe he can teach us some French cooking techniques.<p class="message sent">That would be cool! Maybe he'll bring in some croissants for us to try.<p class=message>Yes, please! Speaking of trying new things, have you ever been adventurous with your food?<p class="message sent">Not really. I'm pretty basic when it comes to food.<p class=message>I see. Well, I'm always up for trying new cuisines. Have you ever had sushi before?<p class="message sent">Nope, never tried it. Is it good?<p class=message>It's amazing! If you're ever feeling adventurous, I'll take you to a great sushi place.<p class="message sent">I'll think about it, but I might need some liquid courage first!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=294ae826-4dc9-46be-afe9-03f856438d11.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
