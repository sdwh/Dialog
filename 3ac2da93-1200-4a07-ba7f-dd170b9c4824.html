It's been keeping me busy, but I'm getting some good results.<p class=message>Well, I'm the database administrator for the company. It's great to have an expert like you on board to help optimize our database operations.<p class="message sent">Thanks, happy to help. So, what are some of the challenges you're currently facing with the database?<p class=message>Mainly, we're having issues with slow responses when pulling data for drug development teams. Also, our current system is not very user-friendly.<p class="message sent">Okay, that's definitely something we can work on. Have you considered upgrading your hardware?<p class=message>We did, but our budget just won't allow it at the moment.<p class="message sent">No problem, we can also optimize the database itself to improve performance. Do you have a list of the tables and queries you're struggling with?<p class=message>Yes, I can provide that for you. But before that, can you tell me more about your experience working with R&D databases?<p class="message sent">Sure, I've worked on similar projects in the past, and have experience with optimizing databases using specialized BI tools.<p class=message>Great, that's what we need. By the way, have you had a chance to talk to the R&D team about their specific needs?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They've been very helpful with providing me with a clear understanding of what they need from the database.<p class=message>Excellent, teamwork makes the dream work.<p class="message sent">Haha, absolutely. So, let's take a look at the tables and queries you're having trouble with, and I'll get to work on optimizing them for better performance.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Also, if you need any assistance from me, don't hesitate to ask.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I appreciate that. Together, we'll create a smooth-running R&D database that will help the company develop life-saving drugs.<p class=message>That's the plan!
