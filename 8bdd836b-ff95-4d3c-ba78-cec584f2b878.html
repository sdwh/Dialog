How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi! It's going well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>It's going pretty good. Just finished cleaning the store, how about you?<p class="message sent">Oh, just running around trying to manage the store. It's like a never-ending race.<p class=message>I bet it is!<p class="message sent">By the way, I've been meaning to ask you - how do you keep the store so clean all the time?<p class=message>Well, it's just a matter of staying on top of things. I make sure to clean up any messes as soon as they happen, and I try to stay organized so I can clean things quickly.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I'm trying to get our staff to be more proactive about keeping things clean, but it's like pulling teeth.<p class=message>Yeah, it can be tough to get people motivated. But maybe if you make it into a game or something? Like, see which department can keep their area the cleanest.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I think I'll try that. Maybe a pizza party for the winning department as an incentive?<p class=message>Absolutely! Who doesn't love pizza? And, of course, a clean store is good for everyone - customers, staff, and management alike.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Thanks for your insight, A.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. And feel free to let me know if you need any more advice on keeping things clean!<p class="message sent">Will do. Alright, I better get back to managing this circus. Thanks again, A.<p class=message>Anytime. Take care, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8bdc23b4-c8b8-404e-985c-7e207b2e3719.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
