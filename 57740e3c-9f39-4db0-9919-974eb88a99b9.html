How's the restaurant doing tonight?<p class="message sent">Good evening, A! It's been busy all night. We've had a lot of tables turn over.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've got a new dish I'd like to try out tonight, would you be interested in taste testing it for me?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'm always up for trying something new. What's in it?<p class=message>It's a fusion dish with Korean and Mexican flavors. Spicy bulgogi tacos with a kimchi salsa.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting! Let me know when it's ready. By the way, have you seen the new guest reviews on our website?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Are they positive?<p class="message sent">Very positive! They love the atmosphere and the service. We even got a mention for our gluten-free options.<p class=message>That's great to hear. It's always nice to get positive feedback from customers.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Speaking of customers, have you noticed any regulars lately?<p class=message>Yes, there's a group of ladies who come in every week for our vegetarian lasagna. They always ask for me to make it.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic! I love hearing about repeat business. Our regulars are what keep us going.<p class=message>Absolutely. By the way, have you tried the new beer we're carrying?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had a chance to. What's it called?<p class=message>It's a local brew called "Liverpool Revolution". It's a pale ale with hints of citrus and honey.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! I'll have to give it a try.<p class=message>I'm sure you'll love it. By the way, did you hear about the new Italian restaurant opening down the street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Do you think it will be competition for us?<p class=message>I don't think so. Our restaurant offers a completely different experience.<p class="message sent">That's true. We have our own unique style and offerings. Plus, we have such a great team working here!<p class=message>Yes, we do. It's really nice working with you, B.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. Let's keep up the great work and make this restaurant the best it can be!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=576fe5d3-b1d2-4b46-86d3-2a991abd9bb9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
