I was pretty good at math in school.<p class="message sent">Thanks Mom, but I can handle it. I'm already almost done.<p class=message>Okay, well, let me know if you change your mind. I'm always happy to help out.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. But hey, do you remember when you were in school? Did you have to use those abacuses?<p class=message>Ha! No, I'm not that old. We had calculators by the time I was in school.<p class="message sent">Calculators? That's so advanced. I wish I had those for this homework.<p class=message>Well, make sure you know how to do the math without the calculator too. It's important to understand the concepts.<p class="message sent">Yeah, yeah. I know. But calculators are just so much faster.<p class=message>I hear you. But think about it this way, if you become a math genius without the calculator, you'll be able to show off to all your friends.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's true. But I'll need some more practice before that happens.<p class=message>Practice makes perfect. And who knows, maybe you'll even enjoy math one day.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I highly doubt that.<p class=message>Hey, anything is possible. Just look at me, I became a math whiz and now I'm a successful accountant.<p class="message sent">Okay, okay, you win. Maybe one day I'll love math too.<p class=message>That's the spirit. Now, let's get back to your homework so you can finish it up and we can have some dinner together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9297fb4f-8b7c-4a72-b8c8-b52d009ff42a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
