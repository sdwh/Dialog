I'm A, the barista. Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent message-content">Hi A, I'm B, the roaster. Nice to meet you too.<p class="message received message-content">So, what brings you to my coffee shop?<p class="message sent message-content">I'm here to learn more about Spanish coffee and how to make the perfect cup.<p class="message received message-content">Well, you've come to the right place. We use the best beans and techniques to make our coffee. Here, let me show you.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds great. I'm excited to learn.<p class="message received message-content">First, we use a blend of Arabica and Robusta beans for a rich and flavorful taste.<p class="message sent message-content">Interesting. Do you roast the beans yourself?<p class="message received message-content">No, we get our beans from a local roaster. But we make sure to use beans that have been roasted recently for maximum freshness.<p class="message sent message-content">That makes sense. What's the next step?<p class="message received message-content">We grind the beans to the right consistency and tamp them firmly into the portafilter.<p class="message sent message-content">Ah, so the key is in the tamping.<p class="message received message-content">That's right. It's important to get the right amount of pressure to ensure a smooth extraction.<p class="message sent message-content">And then you pull the shot?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, we carefully monitor the extraction time to make sure we get a perfect shot every time.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds like a lot of work but worth it for a great cup of coffee.<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely. And we also use the right amount of milk to create the perfect balance for our lattes and cappuccinos.<p class="message sent message-content">I'm impressed. You really know your stuff.<p class="message received message-content">Thank you. And if you ever have any questions or want to learn more, feel free to stop by anytime.<p class="message sent message-content">I definitely will. Thanks for showing me the ropes.<p class="message received message-content">No problem. It was great meeting you. Enjoy your coffee!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0632f763-4d6c-4919-965b-cd106612b79f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
