How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing fantastic. I'm excited to be here and showcase some of my fresh baked cakes.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. We also have some freshly roasted coffee beans ready for a hand pour.<p class=message>That's perfect. I love the smell of freshly roasted coffee in the morning.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's one of the best smells in the world. What flavors of cake do you have available?<p class=message>Today, I have blueberry cheesecake, chocolate fudge cake, and lemon meringue pie.<p class="message sent">Those all sound delicious. How about we pair the blueberry cheesecake with a light roast coffee to balance the flavors?<p class=message>Sounds like a great idea. How do you prepare your hand pour coffee?<p class="message sent">We use a V60 and add 20 grams of freshly ground coffee, 320 grams of hot water, and let it steep for about 2-3 minutes.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a precise process. I'm excited to try it. How long have you been a coffee aficionado?<p class="message sent">I've been in the coffee business for about 10 years now. I started as a barista and fell in love with the art of coffee making.<p class=message>That's impressive! And how about you, how long have you been a baker?<p class=message>I've been baking for about 5 years now. I love experimenting with different flavors and techniques to create new recipes.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. It's clear that you put a lot of passion and care into your baking.<p class=message>Thank you. It's about making people happy through their taste buds.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. And with that in mind, let's dig into this delicious cake and coffee. Cheers!<p class=message>Cheers! Thank you for having me here today. It's been a pleasure.<p class="message sent">Thank you for joining me. It's been a wonderful collaboration.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=df78983a-35da-4626-824d-64913a733505.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
