It’s a pleasure to have you here in our village.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Mr. A. I’m excited to be here to conduct some agriculture education activities with your lovely students.<p class=message>Thank you for coming. Our students are looking forward to it. What activities do you have planned for them?<p class="message sent">We’ll be teaching them about the importance of composting and how to make organic fertilizer. Then, we’ll have them plant some vegetables.<p class=message>That sounds great! Our students always enjoy getting their hands dirty and learning about agriculture.<p class="message sent">That’s wonderful to hear. I’m sure they’ll have a blast. What kind of vegetables do the students usually plant here?<p class=message>Our students usually plant carrots, radishes, and lettuce. We also have some fruit trees like papaya, avocado, and mango.<p class="message sent">Those are all fantastic choices. I’d love to try some of the produce if there’s any extra.<p class=message>Of course! We love to share the fruits of our labor. Speaking of which, have you ever done any gardening yourself, Mr. B?<p class="message sent">Actually, I do have a small vegetable garden at home. I find it relaxing to tend to it in my spare time.<p class=message>I guess gardening is therapeutic no matter where you are. It’s a great way to connect with nature.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And it’s also a valuable skill to have. That’s why I’m so happy to be able to teach the students here about agriculture.<p class=message>We’re lucky to have you as our guest. The students are sure to benefit from your knowledge and experience.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me. I’m looking forward to a fruitful and fun day of learning with the students.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b7604ab4-7016-4494-8289-8f0dd1efe211.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
