That's awesome!<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. Yeah, it was pretty exciting to find those loopholes. But now, comes the hard part - fixing them.<p class=message>Haha, that's where our jobs get interesting. As a security guy, I'll make sure the loop is closed, and as a developer, you'll make sure it's fixed and stays that way.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Of course, you'll have to give me specifics on the nature of the vulnerability so I can target it correctly.<p class=message>No problem. I'll send you an email with all the relevant details, along with a few suggestions on how to fix it.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Let's get to work on this ASAP. The sooner we can get it fixed, the better.<p class=message>Definitely. We don't want any hackers sneaking in and causing trouble. Think of it as a race against the bad guys.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's a good way to put it. I'm up for the challenge. And let's make sure we order a pizza for lunch too, to keep us fueled.<p class=message>Agreed. Pizza and fixing vulnerabilities go hand in hand, don't they?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=69d29602-ff3b-4d72-98f4-b4c7c1f73fb0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
