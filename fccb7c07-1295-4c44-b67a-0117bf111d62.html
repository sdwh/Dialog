Just enjoying the drive. So, where are you headed today?<p class=message>I'm heading towards London Bridge. I've got a meeting there.<p class="message sent">Oh, London bridge is quite famous. Did you know that it's actually falling down?<p class=message>(laughs) That's just a nursery rhyme. I hope it's not actually falling down.<p class="message sent">(laughs along) No, no, it's not actually falling down. It's just a silly old rhyme. London Bridge is perfectly safe.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I don't want to break a leg before my big meeting.<p class="message sent">Speaking of breaking legs, have you ever seen a musical in London's West End?<p class=message>Actually, I haven't. Is there one you'd recommend?<p class="message sent">Well, if you're looking for something light-hearted and fun, you could always go see "Mamma Mia!".<p class=message>That sounds perfect. I love ABBA's music.<p class="message sent">(smiling) I think you'll enjoy it then. It's a really popular show.<p class=message>(noticing the driver's accent) So, are you originally from London?<p class="message sent">No, actually I'm from Scotland. But I've been living here for quite some time now.<p class=message>Oh, I see. So, what do you miss most about Scotland?<p class="message sent">Definitely the haggis. You can't get haggis like that anywhere else.<p class=message>(scrunches up her face) I've never actually tried haggis. It soundsâ€¦ interesting.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Trust me, it's better than it sounds. You should definitely try it if you find yourself in Scotland.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class="message sent">No problem. Anytime. We're almost at your destination now. Here we are, London Bridge.<p class=message>Thanks for the ride. Have a good day.<p class="message sent">You too, take care.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fcc940f2-a909-485b-8d39-77e58a6fb75a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
