What can I get you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I’m a beer enthusiast and I heard you guys have some great brews to try with fish. Can you recommend a pairing for me?<p class=message>Absolutely! I’d recommend our grilled red snapper with our local IPA. The bitterness of the IPA really complements the smoky flavor of the snapper.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great match! How did you get into grilling fish?<p class=message>I grew up near the sea and fishing was a big part of my childhood. I learned how to cook fish from my mother, who had a talent for making any fish taste delicious.<p class="message sent">That’s amazing. Speaking of talent, how did you become a brewer?<p class=message>I actually studied chemistry in college and found my passion for brewing during my internship at a local brewery. I’ve been brewing ever since and love experimenting with new flavors and ingredients.<p class="message sent">That’s really interesting. I’d love to taste some of your creations!<p class=message>Of course! We have a seasonal wheat beer that’s infused with lemongrass that’s been a hit with our customers.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. I’ll definitely give it a try.<p class=message>Great! So, what do you think of the fish?<p class="message sent">It’s amazing! The seasoning is perfect and it’s cooked to perfection. I’ll definitely be coming back for more.<p class=message>I’m glad to hear that! We take great pride in our fish grilling skills.<p class="message sent">And I take great pride in my brewing skills. Maybe we can collaborate on a fish and beer festival in the future!<p class=message>That’s a brilliant idea. We can showcase the best of both our skills and bring in new customers.<p class="message sent">Exactly! And who knows, maybe we can inspire other collaboration projects in Clarke Quay.<p class=message>I couldn’t agree more. Let’s start planning it now!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6e5d22b4-564c-4f88-9e2e-f0c16d12e1fa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
