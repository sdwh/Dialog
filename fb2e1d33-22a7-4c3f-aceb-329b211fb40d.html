How's your day going so far, driver B?<p class="message sent">It's going great! And yours?<p class=message>Couldn't be better, we're off to Tokyo! Have you ever driven someone so far before?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've been all over Japan. What brings you to Tokyo this time?<p class=message>I'm meeting up with some friends for the weekend. What do you recommend I should see while I'm in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out the famous Shibuya Crossing and the Tokyo Tower. They are both great spots.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Have you ever been to Tokyo Disneyland or DisneySea?<p class="message sent">Yes, I actually took my family there last year. We had a blast!<p class=message>That's awesome. I've never been to a Disney park before, but maybe I'll give it a try while I'm here.<p class="message sent">You definitely should! But be prepared for long lines and crowds.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. What about food? Where's the best place to try sushi in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Tsukiji Fish Market is the most popular spot for fresh sushi. But it can get pretty busy, so be sure to get there early.<p class=message>Great! I'm already getting hungry just thinking about it.<p class="message sent">You won't be disappointed, trust me! Is this your first time in Japan?<p class=message>No, actually, it's my third time. I absolutely love this country and its culture.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic to hear! We love having visitors come and enjoy our country.<p class=message>I'm already looking forward to planning my next trip back!<p class="message sent">You're always welcome here.
