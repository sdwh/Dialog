Do you like it?<p class=message>Oh, I love it! There’s just something about the mix of spices and flavors that hits the spot for me.<p class="message sent">I know what you mean. I’m more of a fan of mild curries though. I can’t handle too much heat.<p class=message>Yeah, some curries can really pack a punch. But I love a good spicy one, especially when I have a cold.<p class="message sent">Really? I never thought of that. I always reach for chicken soup. But maybe I should give curry a try next time.<p class=message>It’s worth a shot! And there are so many different types of curry to choose from. Have you tried Thai curry?<p class="message sent">No, I haven’t. Is it very different from Indian curry?<p class=message>Yeah, it’s a bit sweeter and less heavy on the spices. But it’s still delicious.<p class="message sent">I’ll have to try it next time I go out for Thai food. Speaking of which, do you have a favorite place to get curry?<p class=message>There’s a great Indian restaurant down the street from me. Their butter chicken curry is amazing.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds good. I’ll have to check it out. Have you ever tried making curry at home?<p class=message>I have, but it never turns out quite as good as when I get it from a restaurant. How about you?<p class="message sent">Same here. I followed a recipe once and it turned out too bland. Maybe we need to find a better recipe.<p class=message>Let’s make it a challenge – we’ll both try to find a great curry recipe and see who can make the better curry.<p class="message sent">Game on! May the best cook win.<p class=message>Deal! This is going to be one delicious competition.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=45864bc4-8e5a-477a-8b49-0449cdfa9688.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
