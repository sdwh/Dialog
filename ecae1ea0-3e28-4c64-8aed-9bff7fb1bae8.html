My name is Sarah and I’m a food quality control specialist. It’s nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hello Sarah, I am Seulgi and I’m a Kimchi producer. Nice to meet you too.<p class=message>Wow! Kimchi is one of my favorite side dishes. How do you make it?<p class="message sent">Ah, it’s a long process. First, we salt the cabbage and let it sit for a few hours. Then, we add the seasoning and let it ferment for a few more days.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work! How do you ensure the quality of your kimchi?<p class="message sent">We have strict guidelines to follow to ensure the taste and texture of the kimchi is consistent every time. We also do frequent taste tests to ensure the quality is up to par.<p class=message>That’s great to hear. As a food quality control specialist, it’s important to make sure that the product being produced is up to standard. Speaking of which, I’m almost finished with the quality check. Would you like to come and see?<p class="message sent">Sure, I’d love to! It’ll be interesting to see the different methods in our fields.<p class=message>Our methods are quite different, but the end goal is the same - to produce a high-quality product for the customer.<p class="message sent">Definitely! After all, consumers judge the product on the taste and quality, which is what keeps them coming back for more.<p class=message>Exactly! It’s all about meeting the consumers’ expectations and building trust with them.<p class="message sent">I couldn’t agree more. This reminds me of a funny story actually. Once, my friend tricked me into eating a really spicy pepper and made me think it was just regular kimchi. I couldn’t stop laughing because of how it caught me off guard!<p class=message>*laughs* That sounds like quite the practical joke! I’ll keep that in mind to try it out on my friends.<p class="message sent">*laughs* Just be sure not to do it during a food quality control testing!<p class=message>Of course! Thanks for showing me around and chatting with me. It was great to learn more about kimchi production.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Thanks for coming to see us as well. By the way, would you like to try some of our kimchi?<p class=message>I’d love to! It’s always exciting to try new foods. Thanks again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ecacf7db-b024-498a-93ca-2905d35ec731.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
