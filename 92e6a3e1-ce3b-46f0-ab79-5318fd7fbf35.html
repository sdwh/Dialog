I wouldn't miss this band for the world, and I'm glad you're doing a thorough check.<p class=message>Safety is our top priority here, and we appreciate your cooperation. Oh, I see you've got a camera. Please be advised that flash photography and videos are not allowed during the show.<p class="message sent">No problem, I won't be taking any videos. I just want to snap a few shots for my photo album.<p class=message>That's fine, as long as you don't use the flash. I don't want to ruin anyone's enjoyment by being a curmudgeon, but it's important to follow the rules.<p class="message sent">I get it, and I'll make sure to follow them. Thanks for being so friendly and thorough with the security check!<p class=message>No problem, Ma'am. It's our pleasure to make sure everyone has a safe and enjoyable time tonight.
