Have you been to D.C. before?<p class="message sent message-content">No, this will be my first time.<p class="message received message-content">Well, you can't come to D.C. without seeing the Capitol! How about a tour of the Capitol Building and the surrounding grounds?<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds great!<p class="message received message-content">And while you're in the area, have you considered a tour of the National Mall to see all the monuments and memorials?<p class="message sent message-content">That's a must-see for me, I'd love to visit there.<p class="message received message-content">Great choice! And I highly recommend the Smithsonian Museums as well, there are so many interesting exhibits to see.<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I definitely want to check out the museums. How about food and drink?<p class="message received message-content">Oh, there are so many options in D.C. for food and drink! Do you have any preferences or dietary restrictions?<p class="message sent message-content">I'm pretty open to trying anything, but I do have a sweet tooth.<p class="message received message-content">Well, you have to try some of the famous Georgetown Cupcakes or the chocolate chip cookies at Milk Bar!<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds amazing. I can't wait to visit D.C.<p class="message received message-content">I'm sure you'll love it. And don't forget to visit the White House and take pictures with the Cherry Blossoms!<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely adding those to my list. Thank you so much for your help.<p class="message received message-content">My pleasure, enjoy your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0672c339-3ab0-4593-b632-6c9dd4e67636.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
