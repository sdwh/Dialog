How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>Good, thanks. So, we're here to discuss how we can improve our company's network security. Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Well, I think we could start by implementing better firewalls and intrusion detection systems.<p class=message>Definitely agree. We also need to make sure all our employees are well-educated on cyber security risks.<p class="message sent">That's a great point. We can hold regular training sessions to keep everyone up-to-date on the latest threats.<p class=message>And maybe we could create a company-wide password policy to ensure that everyone is using strong, unique passwords.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a good idea. And we should also conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.<p class=message>Agreed, and let's not forget about physical security measures, like surveillance cameras and access control systems.<p class="message sent">Of course, those are critical too. What about cloud security? Do you think we need to beef up our defenses there?<p class=message>Yes, I definitely think we need to review our cloud security practices and make sure they're up to par.<p class="message sent">Sounds like we have a lot of work to do, but we're on the right track. Thanks for sharing your insights, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to help keep our company safe and secure. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a17d5048-82c6-42df-b465-7443d30f4645.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
