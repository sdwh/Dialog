I hope everyone had a great weekend.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Professor! I did, but I feel like I need a vacation after it.<p class=message>Haha, I know what you mean. Sometimes the weekends can be just as busy as the weekdays.<p class="message sent">Definitely. By the way, I wanted to say that I loved your lecture last week on the history of art.<p class=message>Oh, thank you! That's very kind of you to say. Did you have a favorite artist that we talked about?<p class="message sent">I really enjoyed learning about Vincent van Gogh. His work was so unique and expressive.<p class=message>Yes, van Gogh is definitely one of the most well-known artists in history. Have you ever tried your hand at painting?<p class="message sent">I have, but I'm not very good. It's definitely not my strong suit.<p class=message>Well, I believe that every person has something they're good at, whether it's painting or something else entirely.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Maybe I just haven't found my true calling yet!<p class=message>Yes, and remember that it's okay to not be good at everything. We're all unique and that's what makes the world an interesting place.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Thanks for the advice, Professor.<p class=message>Of course! And speaking of unique things, has anyone heard of the world's largest rubber band ball?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What is it?<p class=message>It's an enormous ball made entirely of rubber bands. It weighs over 9,000 pounds!<p class="message sent">Wow, that's crazy! Who would have thought that rubber bands could be so impressive?<p class=message>It just goes to show that anything can be amazing if you have enough creativity and determination.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Maybe I'll start my own collection of rubber bands and see how big I can make a ball!<p class=message>Haha, go for it! Who knows, maybe you'll set a new world record someday.<p class="message sent">You never know! Thanks for the inspiration, Professor.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Keep exploring and trying new things. That's what life is all about!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=788b58ae-e966-4e98-b350-72a8602e08db.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
