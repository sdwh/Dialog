It's been a bit of a challenge!<p class=message>Yeah, I know what you mean. Have you tried partitioning the tables or indexing certain columns?<p class="message sent">I've done both actually, but I'm still seeing some slow queries. I think we might need to look into query optimization.<p class=message>That's a good idea. I heard there's a new tool we can use for that. It's called EXPLAIN and it helps identify slow queries and optimize them.<p class="message sent">Oh, I haven't heard of that. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class=message>No problem. By the way, have you met our new intern yet?<p class="message sent">Nope, I haven't had the chance. What's their role?<p class=message>They're working on front-end development mainly, but they're also interested in learning more about database optimization.<p class="message sent">That's great! The more the merrier. We can always use an extra set of hands.<p class=message>Absolutely. And you know what they say - a problem shared is a problem halved. Maybe we can work together to improve the database performance.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Mind if we grab a coffee and discuss further?<p class=message>Not at all. Let's go! And maybe we can brainstorm some ideas on how to make our website faster and smoother too.<p class="message sent">I like the way you think! Let's get that caffeine buzz going.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e864d15c-692c-4919-8e8b-c60dd8377ccb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
