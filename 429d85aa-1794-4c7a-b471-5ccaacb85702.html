How long have you been driving taxis?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I've been driving taxis for about 5 years now. How about you, have you been to Perth before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time. Do you have any recommendations for places to visit?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. If you're interested in wildlife, you should check out the Perth Zoo. Or if you're more into art and culture, the Art Gallery of Western Australia is a great spot.<p class=message>Sounds like there's a lot to see and do. Are there any local foods I should try?<p class="message sent">Definitely try some Aussie meat pies, they're a classic. And if you're feeling adventurous, try some kangaroo or emu meat.<p class=message>Kangaroo and emu? That's quite unique. I'll make sure to try them.<p class="message sent">You should also try some local wines if you have the chance. Western Australia has some great vineyards.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. Do you have any interesting stories about driving taxis here?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. Once, I had a passenger who was on her way to her wedding. She realized she forgot her wedding bouquet at her hotel, so we had to turn back and get it. Luckily we made it to the wedding on time!<p class=message>That's quite a story. I hope I have a smooth ride to my hotel.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'll get you there safe and sound. Enjoy your trip in Perth!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=429a58d9-687e-4550-a08a-a107261a4e8c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
