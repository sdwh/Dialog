It can be a bit overwhelming at first.<p class=message>Exactly! What's the best way to go about it?<p class="message sent">Well, first things first, you need to identify all of your company's assets and evaluate the risks associated with each.<p class=message>Okay, that makes sense. Then what?<p class="message sent">After you've identified the risks, you need to put in place procedures to manage those risks.<p class=message>Got it. Do you need to involve everyone in the company in this process?<p class="message sent">It's definitely helpful to include everyone who has access to those assets, or who might be involved in implementing the procedures.<p class=message>That makes sense. So what are some of the challenges that you've faced when implementing this standard?<p class="message sent">One of the main challenges can be resistance to change. Some employees might not be used to following strict procedures.<p class=message>Yeah, I can see how that could be a problem. What can you do about it?<p class="message sent">Communication is key. Explain why the change is necessary, and the benefits to the company and its employees.<p class=message>Great advice. How long does it usually take to implement the changes?<p class="message sent">It really depends on the size of your company and how complex your processes are. But it's definitely worth taking the time to do it right.<p class=message>I agree. So what's the timeline for getting this done?<p class="message sent">I would recommend starting with a thorough assessment of your current processes, and then creating a plan with achievable goals and a reasonable timeline.<p class=message>Okay, I'll get started on that. Thanks for your help, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. Good luck!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a7e40424-06c1-4d94-a019-f45830d543a6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
