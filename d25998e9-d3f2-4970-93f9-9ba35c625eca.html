How's business today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. So far so good. Thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>It's been quite hectic, but I'm managing. By the way, I noticed that some people have been entering the store without undergoing the security check.<p class="message sent">Really? That's not good. We need to make sure everyone goes through the check.<p class=message>Yes, we should be more strict with our safety measures. How about we remind the customers using a funny sign?<p class="message sent">That's a good idea, A. What can we write for the sign?<p class=message>How about, "Attention shoppers, please put your invisible cloak in the X-ray machine for safety check"?<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's hilarious, A. I bet that'll get their attention.<p class=message>Exactly. We can also put up signs about not leaving their trolleys unattended.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a big safety concern. We don't want anyone tripping over them.<p class=message>And don't forget to remind them about social distancing measures.<p class="message sent">Right. We should also put markings on the floor to help them keep the proper distance.<p class=message>That's a great idea. We want all our customers to feel safe while enjoying their shopping experience.<p class="message sent">Yes, safety should always be our top priority. Thank you for bringing this up, A.<p class=message>You're welcome. I'll make sure to keep an eye out for those sneaky shoppers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d24f2c3a-4f48-43ee-8266-5d07bb463646.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
