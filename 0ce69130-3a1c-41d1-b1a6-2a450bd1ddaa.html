What have you got so far?<p class="message sent">Well, we're looking into using a combination of load balancing and traffic filtering to mitigate the impact of attacks.<p class=message>Nice, that sounds like a solid approach. How effective do you think it would be?<p class="message sent">It should be pretty effective, but of course it all depends on the scale and complexity of the attack.<p class=message>True, you can never be too prepared when it comes to security. Have you considered any other measures?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we're also looking at setting up a network of sensors to detect and analyze incoming traffic.<p class=message>That's a smart move. Do you think AI could play a role in detecting and responding to DDoS attacks in the future?<p class="message sent">Definitely, AI has a lot of potential in that area. But for now, we're focusing on more practical solutions.<p class=message>Makes sense. Well, good luck with your planning. And by the way, have you heard the joke about the hacker who got arrested?<p class="message sent">No, what happened?<p class=message>He refused to take off his hoodie during the trial. He was charged with contempt of court.<p class="message sent">Hahaha, that's a good one. Speaking of hoodies, did you see the new one I got? It's got a built-in zipper to shield your face from cameras.<p class=message>Wow, that's some serious security fashion right there. You'll have to show me where you got it sometime.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0ce552af-9837-431e-89e9-fdba68474375.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
