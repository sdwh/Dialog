I never knew Australia had terrain like this.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's quite impressive, isn't it? The rugged landscapes of Tasmania are unlike anything else in the country.<p class=message>I'm glad I hired you as my guide, otherwise, I would have never discovered this hidden gem.<p class="message sent">That's what I'm here for. It's always a pleasure to show people the beauty of the great outdoors.<p class=message>So, have you seen any interesting wildlife during your time here?<p class="message sent">Actually, just yesterday I came across a wallaby and it was completely unfazed when I approached it.<p class=message>I'm surprised it didn't run away. Maybe it was posing for a photo?<p class="message sent">Ha! It's possible. But, in all seriousness, we have to be careful not to disturb the wildlife here.<p class=message>Absolutely, we must respect their habitat. By the way, do you have any suggestions for a good climbing spot?<p class="message sent">I recommend Mount Wellington. It's not too far from here and it offers a challenging but rewarding climb.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. Let's make that our next stop.<p class="message sent">Great idea. We'll take a break here and then continue on to Mount Wellington.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b73ad178-712e-4078-9ecb-2634ee91e62c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
