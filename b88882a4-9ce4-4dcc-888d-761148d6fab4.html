The menu looks great.<p class=message>What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Well, I've heard that the chicken parmigiana is really good here. And the steak is supposedly top-notch.<p class=message>Hmm, I'm not sure what I want yet. Maybe I'll go for the classic burger.<p class="message sent">Can't go wrong with that. So, how's everything going at work lately?<p class=message>It's been busy, but I think we're making good progress. How about your department?<p class="message sent">We've had a few challenges, but overall things are going well.

I hope you enjoy it!<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'm looking forward to it. Oh, and speaking of enjoying things, look at this dessert menu!<p class=message>Wow, those all look amazing.
