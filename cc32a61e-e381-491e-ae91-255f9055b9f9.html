Hmm, I'm not sure I have. What is it?<p class=message>It's a delicious Peruvian dish made with shredded chicken, walnuts, and a spicy pepper sauce called Aji Amarillo. It's a must-try if you ever visit Peru.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that sounds amazing! I love spicy food. Do you know how to make it?<p class=message>Actually, I do! My grandma taught me her secret recipe. It's not too difficult to make, but it does take some time to prepare.<p class="message sent">Can you make it for me sometime? I would love to try it!<p class=message>Of course, I'd be happy to! It's always more fun to share good food with friends.<p class="message sent">I totally agree. What do you usually serve Aji de Gallina with?<p class=message>It's traditionally served with white rice and boiled potatoes, but some people also like to have it with a side salad.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds like a filling meal. You know, I think I'll have to invite myself over for dinner so we can make it together!<p class=message>Haha, sounds like a plan! We could have a mini Peruvian feast. And for dessert, we could make alfajores!<p class="message sent">Oh man, you're making me hungry just thinking about it. We definitely have to do this soon.<p class=message>Absolutely! Maybe we can even try some other Peruvian dishes too. There are so many tasty options to choose from.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. But for now, let's focus on perfecting the Aji de Gallina recipe. I'm excited to try it!<p class=message>Alright, it's a deal.
