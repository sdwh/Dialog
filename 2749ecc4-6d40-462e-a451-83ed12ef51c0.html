Are you interested in renting a car?<p class="message sent">Yes, I work for a rental company and I'm here to pick up a reservation for a customer.<p class=message>Great! We have a few rental companies located just a short walk away from our lot. Have you arranged for transportation?<p class="message sent">Yes, our customer will be taking a shuttle to the rental facility. Can you tell me if there are any parking restrictions we need to be aware of?<p class=message>Absolutely. Please note that overnight parking is not allowed in our lot. However, if you need to park for a short while, we offer hourly and daily rates.<p class="message sent">Thank you for letting me know. Can I also ask if there are any speed limits within the parking lot?<p class=message>Yes, we have a posted speed limit of 5 mph throughout the lot to ensure the safety of pedestrians and vehicles.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. Finally, can you recommend any places nearby to grab a quick bite while we wait for our customer to pick up the rental?<p class=message>Sure thing! There are plenty of dining options located in the surrounding area, including some great fast-food chains and sit-down restaurants.<p class="message sent">Thanks for your help! Your knowledge of the parking lot rules and nearby amenities is much appreciated.<p class=message>No problem at all! It's always a pleasure to assist our customers with their travel needs.
