Can you tell me a bit about it?<p class="message sent">Sure! This game is called "Escape the Office". It's a puzzle game where players have to solve clues to escape from their mundane work environment.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. What kind of clues are we talking about here?<p class="message sent">Well, for example, players might have to find a key hidden in a plant, or solve a riddle to decipher a code.<p class=message>Oh cool, I'm already hooked. What kind of characters are involved in this game?<p class="message sent">The main character is a cubicle worker who is desperate to escape the office. There are also quirky co-workers that players can interact with, like the annoying HR person or the coffee-obsessed receptionist.<p class=message>Haha, sounds like a lot of fun. What inspired you to make this game?<p class="message sent">Honestly, working in an office environment myself sparked the idea. I think a lot of people can relate to the feeling of being stuck at work and wanting to escape.<p class=message>I totally get that. Speaking of work, have you been working on this game alone or do you have a team helping you?<p class="message sent">It's just me for now, but I plan on getting some additional help with coding and graphics down the line.<p class=message>Sounds like a smart plan. When can we expect to see this game available?<p class="message sent">I'm aiming for a release in about six months or so. I want to make sure it's polished and perfect before putting it out there.<p class=message>I can't wait to try it out! Is there anything else you want to share about the game?<p class="message sent">Hmm, well I guess I can tell you that there will be some fun Easter eggs hidden throughout the game. Players who really pay attention might find some secret surprises.<p class=message>Nice! I love discovering hidden treasures in games. Well, thanks for chatting with me about "Escape the Office". I can't wait to play it!<p class="message sent">Thanks for showing interest, A. I'll keep you updated on its progress.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=efc29278-f0b0-48a2-afa1-a940bd2cc143.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
