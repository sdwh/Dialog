Can you recommend a main course and a red wine to pair?<p class="message sent">Of course! Our grilled salmon with roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes is always a popular choice. As for wine, I suggest a full-bodied Merlot.<p class=message>Hmm, that does sound delicious. What about something with beef?<p class="message sent">Our sirloin steak with mushroom sauce and garlic mashed potatoes is a classic favorite. And for wine, I recommend a bold Cabernet Sauvignon.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. Is it a big portion?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's definitely a hearty portion. You won't leave here hungry!<p class=message>Great! My mouth is already watering. Do you have any vegetarian options?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Our eggplant Parmesan with a side salad is a delicious and filling choice. And for wine, I suggest a lighter Pinot Noir.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds just as tasty. How do you distinguish the different types of wine?<p class="message sent">Well, red wines tend to be bolder and richer, while whites are usually lighter and crisper. Within those categories, there are endless variations in flavor profiles.<p class=message>That definitely helps. I think I'll go for the sirloin with the Cabernet. Thanks for your recommendations!<p class="message sent">My pleasure. I'll get your order started right away. And feel free to ask any further questions you might have about our menu or wine selection.<p class=message>Thank you, you have been extremely helpful. I'm excited for my meal.<p class="message sent">Enjoy your dinner and have a great night!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=26a52954-b239-4855-a5dc-974bc7bf27ae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
