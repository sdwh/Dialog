Thank you for joining us tonight. The customer requested a seafood dish, what do you suggest?<p class=message>Excellent choice. For seafood, I would recommend a light-bodied white wine, such as a Sauvignon Blanc or a Pinot Grigio. It would go well with the dish, and the crispness would complement the flavors.<p class="message sent">I see. How about for meat dishes, sir?<p class=message>For meat dishes, a full-bodied red wine would be a great choice. A Cabernet Sauvignon or a Merlot would pair well with the heartiness of the dish.<p class="message sent">That’s good to know. How about for dessert?<p class=message>For desserts, a sweet fruity wine like a Riesling or a Moscato would be best. They’re great for a sweet aftertaste and they won’t overpower the dessert.<p class="message sent">Interesting. Do you have any fun or unique wine recommendations for adventurous customers?<p class=message>Of course! For adventurous customers, I would recommend trying a wine from “orange wine” – white wines that have been left in contact with the grape skins that give them an amber or orange color. It provides a unique and complex flavor that’s worth trying.<p class="message sent">Wow, I’ve never heard of that before! Thank you for the recommendation.<p class=message>My pleasure. If you have any other questions or special requests, don’t hesitate to ask. I’d be happy to help.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your help tonight. Our customers will definitely appreciate the knowledge you have provided.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a5e5b68-d079-4625-ab99-339bff81c0d7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
