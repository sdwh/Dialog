Can you recommend some dishes?<p class="message sent">Certainly! Our menu includes some classic German dishes such as bratwurst, sauerkraut, and pork knuckles.<p class=message>Oh, those all sound delicious. Can you tell me more about them?<p class="message sent">Bratwurst is a type of sausage made with pork and spices, often served with sauerkraut which is pickled cabbage. And pork knuckles, also known as Schweinshaxe, are roasted until crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.<p class=message>Wow, that all sounds amazing. Do you have any personal favorites?<p class="message sent">Definitely the pork knuckles. They're crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside - a perfect pairing with a cold beer.<p class=message>That sounds perfect! Is there anything else I should try while I'm here?<p class="message sent">You could also try our potato pancakes, which are a popular side dish in Germany. They're made with grated potatoes and served with sour cream or applesauce.<p class=message>Yum, I'll definitely try those. Are there any traditional German beers I should pair with my meal?<p class="message sent">We have a selection of German beers, including pilsners, lagers, and wheat beers that would complement your meal nicely.<p class=message>I'll definitely have to try some. Thank you for all your help, I can't wait to try everything!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Enjoy your meal and let me know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d1a0ff6f-dedf-4ff1-879d-fd056db2851c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
