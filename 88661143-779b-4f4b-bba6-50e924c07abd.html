By the way, have you tried any local cuisine yet while we're here in Osaka?<p class=message>Yes, I have! The okonomiyaki was amazing, I couldn't get enough of it.<p class="message sent">Glad to hear it. And speaking of getting enough, we need to make sure we're warmed up before our show tonight. Can you run through some scales with me?<p class=message>Absolutely! *starts playing on their instrument*<p class="message sent">You know, I've been thinking. We should try to arrange some collaborations with other musicians in Japan.<p class=message>That's a great idea, B! We could make some amazing music with them.<p class="message sent">It would be a great opportunity to share our own musical style and learn from theirs.<p class=message>Definitely! I love how music can bring people together from different cultures and backgrounds.<p class="message sent">That's why we do what we do, A. To share our passion and connect with others through music.<p class=message>Well, let's go out there and do just that tonight, B. Let's give the audience a performance they won't forget.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's go rock this show!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=886471e3-ca59-494d-b7b2-1e3c27c519e4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
