I couldn't help but notice how busy the harbor is today. Are you a fisherman?<p class="message sent">Yep! Been a fisherman all my life. What brings you here?<p class=message>I'm a marine biologist, and I'm interested in learning about local fishing practices.<p class="message sent">Great! It's important to have a balance between fishing and conservation, you know.<p class=message>Absolutely. I believe that sustainable fishing practices can protect marine life and also support the livelihoods of local fishermen.<p class="message sent">Couldn't agree more. That's why we only catch what we need, and we release small or young fish back into the water to let them grow.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear. Have you heard about the importance of avoiding overfishing, especially for certain species?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we try to avoid those areas and focus on other species that are abundant in the area.<p class=message>That's really great to hear. If we want to enjoy seafood for years to come, we all need to take a more sustainable approach to fishing.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We need to work together to keep our oceans healthy and productive for generations to come.<p class=message>You're absolutely right about that. It was great talking with you. Stay safe out on the water!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3f901add-78b0-4b6a-a75b-3dbffce2154f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
