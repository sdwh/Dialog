You must be the restaurant owner, right? My name is Alex and I'm the new barista for your coffee shop.<p class="message sent">Hi Alex, nice to meet you! Yes, I'm the owner of this restaurant. I'm glad you're here. Can you tell me more about your background?<p class=message>Sure! I used to work in a coffee shop in New York for five years. Then, I moved to Paris for a while to learn more about latte art.<p class="message sent">That's impressive! I'm sure you'll make great coffee. We're a small cafe in the heart of Lucerne. Our customers are mostly locals and tourists. What's your specialty?<p class=message>I really enjoy making latte art. I can make a bear, a swan, or even a mermaid! But, I also love making cappuccinos and Americanos.<p class="message sent">That's great! Our customers love their coffee, so it's important that it tastes good. Do you know anything about Swiss coffee culture?<p class=message>I've done some research online. I know that Swiss people love their espresso and hot chocolate. They also enjoy pastries, like croissants and tarts.<p class="message sent">Wow! You've done your homework. We do have a good selection of pastries, and we also serve tea and hot chocolate. Do you have any ideas for new drinks we could add to our menu?<p class=message>Yes, I was thinking of adding some seasonal drinks, like a pumpkin spice latte for the fall or a peppermint mocha for the winter.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea! I'm excited to try them. We should also think about creating a special blend of coffee for our cafe. I want our customers to come for the coffee, not just the pastries.<p class=message>That's a good point. I'll work on creating a signature blend for our cafe. I'm excited to start working here!<p class="message sent">Me too! Let's make sure we work together to make this cafe the best it can be. Do you have any questions for me?<p class=message>Not right now, but I'm sure I'll have plenty as I get settled in. Thanks for the warm welcome!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c84e1ca8-4a60-4a8f-a102-827004c92140.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
