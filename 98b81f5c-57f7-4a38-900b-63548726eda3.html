Are you interested in learning ASP.NET Core?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. But I'm not sure where to start.<p class=message>Don't worry, I can give you a few tips to get you started. First, make sure you have a good understanding of C# language.<p class="message sent">Okay. I know the basics of C#.<p class=message>Great! Next, you'll want to learn the basics of web development, HTML, and CSS.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I already have some knowledge about them.<p class=message>Perfect. Now, start reading through the official ASP.NET Core documentation.<p class="message sent">Alright, I can do that. But I feel like I need some hands-on experience too.<p class=message>Yes, that's a good point. You should try building a small project, like a simple web application.<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds like a good idea. Are there any resources you recommend for that?<p class=message>Yes, you can try following tutorials on websites like Pluralsight and Udemy. Also, the official ASP.NET Core website has some great tutorials too.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll check them out. What about advanced topics like authentication and authorization?<p class=message>Those are important too. You can find some great resources on Microsoft's official documentation for that.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice. It seems like there's a lot to learn, but I'm excited to get started.<p class=message>Don't worry, it's not as overwhelming as it seems. Just take it one step at a time and keep practicing.<p class="message sent">Okay, I will. Thanks for your help!<p class=message>No problem, happy to assist. Good luck with your learning journey!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=98b03958-9a4e-41a2-8232-170a2d1d7e53.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
