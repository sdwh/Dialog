Where can I take you today?<p class="message sent">Hi! Can you take me to the King's Park, please?<p class=message>Sure thing, buddy! Are you a tourist in Perth?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I just arrived yesterday.<p class=message>That's great! Have you visited any other places in the city?<p class="message sent">Not yet. I wanted to check out the park first.<p class=message>You'll love King's Park. The view of the city from there is breathtaking.<p class="message sent">I heard so too! Do you recommend any good restaurants around there?<p class=message>Oh yes, plenty of them. One of my favourites is 'C restaurant'. You should definitely try their seafood platter.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me! Do you come here often?<p class=message>I do, I've been living in Perth my whole life.<p class="message sent">Wow, then you must know a lot about the city.<p class=message>Yep, pretty much! If you need any recommendations, feel free to ask me.<p class="message sent">I'll do that, thanks! So, do you enjoy your job?<p class=message>Yeah, I do. I get to meet new people every day and hear interesting stories.<p class="message sent">That's cool. What's the craziest story you've heard from a passenger?<p class=message>Oh man, I've heard so many! But I think the funniest one was when a guy tried to fit a whole couch inside my car.<p class="message sent">(Laughs) That's insane! Did he actually manage to do it?<p class=message>Nope, he had to call a bigger vehicle. But it was definitely memorable.<p class="message sent">I can imagine! Thanks for sharing the story. We're here now. How much do I owe you?<p class=message>That'll be $15. Have a great time at King's Park, mate!<p class="message sent">Thanks a lot, I will!
