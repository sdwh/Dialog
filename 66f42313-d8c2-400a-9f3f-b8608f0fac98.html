Thanks for meeting up with me for this interview.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. Thanks for having me.<p class=message>So, tell me a little bit about yourself. Where are you from?<p class="message sent">I'm originally from Brazil, but I've been living in the US for the past 10 years.<p class=message>That's cool! Do you miss anything from Brazil?<p class="message sent">Definitely the food. Nothing beats a good Brazilian barbecue.<p class=message>Oh, I know what you mean. The meat there is fantastic. So, what brings you to the US?<p class="message sent">I came here to study and ended up falling in love with the country.<p class=message>Nice. What did you study?<p class="message sent">I studied business and now I run my own startup.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. What's your startup all about?<p class="message sent">We provide eco-friendly alternatives to everyday products.<p class=message>That's amazing. I love seeing companies that prioritize sustainability. So, what do you do for fun?<p class="message sent">I love to play soccer and read books. How about you?<p class=message>I enjoy hiking and trying new foods. Speaking of food, what's your favorite dish?<p class="message sent">It's hard to choose just one, but I would have to say feijoada. It's a traditional Brazilian dish with black beans and meat.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! I might have to try that. Well, that's all the time we have for the interview. Thanks so much for chatting with me, B!<p class="message sent">Thanks for having me, A!
