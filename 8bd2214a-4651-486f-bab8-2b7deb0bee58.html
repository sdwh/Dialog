Thanks for coming to help me fix my race car.<p class="message sent">No problem A, always happy to get my hands dirty with some good old fashioned maintenance.<p class=message>I knew I could count on you. So what seems to be the problem this time?<p class="message sent">Looks like you've got some engine trouble, not surprising given how much you pushed her in the last race.<p class=message>Yeah, I guess I can get a little carried away sometimes. Any chance we can knock it out quick?<p class="message sent">With my expertise and your passion for speed, I'm sure we'll get her back in tip-top shape in no time.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear! So, how's everything else going on your end of the track?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, can't complain. Although, I gotta say, it's been a bit of a slow season for repairs.<p class=message>Well, that's a good thing, right? No one wants to see their ride in the shop.<p class="message sent">Sure, but it's also an adrenaline rush to put my skills to the test and fix up a car that's been through a rough race. Keeps me on my toes.<p class=message>You've got a point there. Speaking of adrenaline rushes, I think I might need a new set of brakes soon.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'll check them out while we're at it. Can't have you flying off the track without proper stopping power!<p class=message>Haha, true that. Thanks again, B. You're a lifesaver.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. Now let's get to work and make this baby purr!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8bd0cdf4-dfc4-4c00-b988-6c327e017e33.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
