How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm feeling great, thanks. Ready to start another busy day?<p class=message>Yes, indeed. It looks like we've got quite a few customers waiting for us already. Let's get started.<p class="message sent">Sure, what can I help you with first?<p class=message>Can you start by making a few iced coffees? It's pretty warm outside today, and I think that's what people are going to want.<p class="message sent">No problem. Iced coffees coming right up.<p class=message>Great job, B! You're getting the hang of this place really quickly.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. It's been a lot of fun learning how to make all these different drinks.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. We've got a lot of regulars who come here every day, so it's important that we maintain a high standard.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Speaking of regulars, do you recognize the guy in the green shirt over there? He comes in pretty much every day.<p class=message>Oh yeah, that's Mr. Kim. He always orders a caramel macchiato with extra whipped cream.<p class="message sent">Got it. I'll start making it right away.<p class=message>Thanks. And while you're at it, can you also help me restock the fridge with some more milk? We're running low.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. I'll be right back.<p class=message>You're doing a great job, B. Keep up the good work.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I'm really happy to be working here.<p class=message>We're happy to have you. Hey, can I ask you a question?<p class="message sent">Of course.<p class=message>Do you have any hobbies outside of work?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I do. I like playing soccer and learning new recipes to cook at home.<p class=message>That's awesome. Maybe one day you could bring some of your cooking in to share with us.<p class="message sent">I'd love to. I'm always looking for new taste testers!<p class=message>Haha, I can't wait. Alright, we're almost done for the day. Let's clean up and cash out the register.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Thanks for another great day at work, A.<p class=message>No problem. See you tomorrow, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=336c9791-e00f-40d5-b318-f1612f5b8755.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
