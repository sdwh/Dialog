What a beautiful day to buy some fresh seafood, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed! We're lucky to have so many options here in Zhuhai. Are you in the market for anything specific?<p class=message>I'm looking for some live crabs, some prawns, and a few fish. What about you?<p class="message sent">I need some squid, octopus, and a big lobster for a special dinner tonight. Have you been here before? This market has some of the best seafood in the area.<p class=message>No, this is my first time. I usually get my seafood from the nearby town. But I wanted to try something different today.<p class="message sent">You'll love it! Just make sure you check out different stalls before you make your purchase. And don't be afraid to haggle for a lower price!<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. What about that huge shark over there? Isn't that illegal to sell?<p class="message sent">Yes it is, and it's also not safe for consumption. Some vendors try to sell it to unsuspecting customers who don't know any better. Stick to the licensed vendors who follow the rules.<p class=message>Thanks for the tip! I wouldn't want to get sick from eating something that's not fit for consumption.<p class="message sent">No problem! Safety should always come first, especially when it comes to what we eat. Do you need help carrying your purchases?<p class=message>That would be great, thanks! You're such a helpful assistant.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. Plus, we're neighbors after all. We should always lend a helping hand to each other.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=59439d5b-b378-4d1d-9908-e68f5059a7a3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
