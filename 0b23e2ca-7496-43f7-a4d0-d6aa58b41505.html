Would you like to try some of our delicious pastries?<p class="message sent">Yes please! I heard from a friend that your pastries are not only tasty, but they are also presented beautifully.<p class=message>Thank you very much! We are very proud of our desserts here. By the way, have you seen our handmade ceramic plates and teacups?<p class="message sent">Oh, I did notice them. They are stunning! Did you make them yourself?<p class=message>No, actually my partner is a talented ceramic artist. We thought it would be a great way to combine our passions to provide not only great food but also unique tableware.<p class="message sent">That's an excellent idea! I think your customers would love to have not only the great taste of your pastries but also a rare handcrafted presentation.<p class=message>Yes, we are so happy to hear that! And you mentioned that you are a potter too, right?<p class="message sent">Yes! I have a little studio in town where I make my pottery.<p class=message>That's amazing! We should collaborate and make a unique set of pottery just for our cafe.<p class="message sent">That sounds like fun! I'd love to do that. How about I make some dessert plates and small teapots that complement your pastries?<p class=message>That's perfect! And in return, we can name some of our pastries after your designs.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's an amazing idea! I can already imagine a chocolate cake named after one of my teapot designs.<p class=message>Sounds great! I can already imagine how beautiful it would look on one of our ceramic plates. And filling our cafe with more pottery from local artists like yourself would only make our cafe more unique.<p class="message sent">I agree! I think the locals would love knowing that they can enjoy delicious desserts while also supporting local artists.<p class=message>Exactly! I'm so excited about this collaboration. Our desserts and your pottery are a match made in heaven.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more! Let's make it happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0b1fec4d-a95e-4a2e-8577-13f08adfe3fe.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
