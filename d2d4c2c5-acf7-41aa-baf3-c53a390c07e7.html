I'm happy to get some fresh air and exercise today."<p class=message>"Do you remember the first time we came to this park together?"<p class="message sent">"Yes, it was last summer. We had a lot of fun playing frisbee and having a picnic."<p class=message>"That's right! Do you want to do something similar today?"<p class="message sent">"Sure, that sounds great! Can we also fly my drone to take some aerial pictures?"<p class=message>"Absolutely! Let's find a wide-open space to fly it safely."<p class="message sent">"Look over there, Dad! It's a group of people doing yoga. Can we try joining them?"<p class=message>"Why not! It'll be a fun challenge for us to see how flexible we can be."<p class="message sent">"This is harder than I thought. How do they twist their bodies like that?"<p class=message>"I have no idea. But let's focus and try to do our best."<p class="message sent">"I love doing activities with you, Dad! You're always so supportive and fun."<p class=message>"You're my favorite exercise partner, B. Have you thought about what sport you want to join in school?"<p class="message sent">"Hmm, not really. What sport did you play when you were my age?"<p class=message>"I played soccer and basketball. But I also tried swimming and tennis. You can choose any sport that interests you."<p class="message sent">"I'll think about it. But right now, let's go grab some ice cream from the food truck."<p class=message>"Sounds like a sweet reward for our walk and exercise.
