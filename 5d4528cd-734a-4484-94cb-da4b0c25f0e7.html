I'm glad we can work on this project together.<p class="message sent">Likewise! So, what's the plan for the application?<p class=message>Well, we need to make sure that customers can easily book their flights online.<p class="message sent">Of course, but we also have to consider the check-in process before boarding.<p class=message>Absolutely. I was thinking we could have customers check-in through the app and scan their boarding pass at the gate.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. How about incorporating seat selection into the booking process?<p class=message>Definitely. We can show customers the seating layout and let them choose their preferred seat.<p class="message sent">Sounds great, but let's not forget about special requests like wheelchair assistance or dietary restrictions.<p class=message>Right, we can include those options in the booking process as well. What about payment methods?<p class="message sent">We can offer multiple payment options like credit cards, PayPal, and even frequent flyer miles.<p class=message>Awesome. I also think we should have a feature that displays flight status updates and gate changes.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. We don't want customers to miss their flights because of last-minute changes.<p class=message>Agreed. And for the app's design, we should keep it simple and user-friendly.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Clear and simple instructions can make all the difference.<p class=message>Overall, I think we've got some great ideas to work with!<p class="message sent">Me too! I'm excited to see this app come together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5d4361da-cfb1-43e0-a9f1-7a5f508a0840.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
