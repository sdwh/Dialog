Are you excited to go fruit picking today?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! This is my first time picking fruit, so I'm really looking forward to it.<p class=message>Great! What kind of fruit do you want to pick? We have apples, oranges, and peaches right now.<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough decision. I think I'll start with some apples.<p class=message>Good choice! Follow me, I'll take you to the apple orchard.<p class="message sent">Wow, this orchard is huge! How long does it take to pick all of the apples?<p class=message>It usually takes about a week with a team of workers. But it's a great workout!<p class="message sent">Definitely. So, how do I know which apples are ripe for picking?<p class=message>Look for the ones with a bright color and a firm texture. Also, give them a gentle twist to see if they come off easily.<p class="message sent">Got it. Hey, what's that up in the tree? A bird's nest?<p class=message>Yes, it's a magpie nest. They like to build them up high to protect their eggs from predators.<p class="message sent">How cool! I've never seen a magpie before.<p class=message>They're pretty common around here. Just make sure not to disturb the nest or the birds.<p class="message sent">Of course. Hey, this apple looks perfect! Can I try it?<p class=message>Sure, go ahead. How does it taste?<p class="message sent">Sweet and juicy! I think I'll fill up my basket with these.<p class=message>Great job! Want to take a break and have some fresh apple juice?<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Thanks for the invitation.<p class=message>No problem. It's the least we can do for our hard-working fruit pickers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5406c62f-c272-42a7-a00d-9de3e9b5d201.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
