Nice to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm B, the network engineer. Pleasure to meet you too.<p class=message>So, let's get started with the audit. Can you show me where you store your servers and if they have proper physical security measures in place?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Follow me. By the way, I really like your tie. It's very stylish.<p class=message>Thank you! My wife picked it out for me.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. It suits you well. Now, let me show you our server room. We have biometric locks, security cameras, and environmental controls.<p class=message>Great! Everything appears to be in order. Hey, have you tried that new sushi place near the office?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! Their salmon sushi is to die for. Have you been there yet?<p class=message>Not yet, I'm planning to visit this weekend. I heard their tempura is excellent too.<p class="message sent">You should definitely try it. Speaking of food, have you tried the cafeteria's new menu?<p class=message>Not yet, but I heard they have a vegetarian burger that is delicious. Do you recommend anything?<p class="message sent">I've heard their grilled chicken pesto panini is a hit. I'm planning to try it myself.<p class=message>Sounds good, I'll give it a try. By the way, do you know how often you do backups of your system?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do daily backups and have an off-site backup location. Our data is always protected.<p class=message>Perfect. That's exactly what we need to ensure compliance with ISO 27001. Hey, I was thinking if we finish up early, we could go grab a coffee and chat about travel.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. I love traveling to exotic destinations. How about you?<p class=message>Same here! I just came back from a trip to Thailand. The food there was amazing.<p class="message sent">Thailand is on my bucket list. I'm hoping to visit it in the next few years. Hey, is that a new watch? It looks really cool.<p class=message>Yes, it is! My son gave it to me for my birthday. It's a fitness tracker, so I can track my steps and sleep patterns.<p class="message sent">Wow, I might need to get one of those for myself. It's really neat. Anyway, let's wrap up this audit and get that coffee. Thanks for being a great auditor.<p class=message>Thank you, B. You've been a great help too. Let's make sure your network stays secure and compliant with ISO 27001.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5c175e44-3f76-447f-abfa-deb34142089e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
