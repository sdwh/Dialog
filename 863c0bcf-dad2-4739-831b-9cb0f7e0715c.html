Just going over the code for the new project.<p class=message>Cool! How's it going so far?<p class="message sent">Well, I ran a source code inspection and found a few issues that need to be fixed.<p class=message>Oh no, what kind of issues?<p class="message sent">Mostly some syntax errors and some unused variables that were causing confusion.<p class=message>I see. Well, it's good that you caught those early. How are you going to fix them?<p class="message sent">I already started making the necessary changes to the code. It's just going to take some time to test everything to make sure it still works.<p class=message>That's great. Don't worry, you've got this. And if you need any help, just let me know.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I really appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem. That's what teammates are for, right? Have you had a chance to look at the code review I did for your previous project?<p class="message sent">Not yet. I've been so focused on this new project.<p class=message>That's understandable, but don't forget to take a break once in a while. Your brain needs some rest.<p class="message sent">I know, I know. You're right. I'll take a look at it tonight.<p class=message>Sounds good. Let me know if you have any questions. I'm happy to help.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I really value your input.<p class=message>Anytime, B.
