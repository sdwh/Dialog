How's your coding going this morning?<p class="message sent">Hey A! It's going well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain, just sipping on some coffee to start the day off right. So, I was thinking we could build a new feature using Ruby on Rails. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! What kind of feature do you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking about implementing a search bar that filters through our database for specific keywords. It could be a useful addition for our users.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We could use some of the built-in Rails libraries to make it happen.<p class=message>Exactly. And we could make it look more appealing by adding some CSS styling. Do you have any specific color schemes in mind?<p class="message sent">How about a nice blue hue for the search bar and a light grey background to contrast it?<p class=message>I like it! We could also add some animation effects when users type in their search query. It could be a nice touch.<p class="message sent">That would definitely make it more user-friendly. Are you thinking something like a fade-in effect?<p class=message>Yeah, that would be perfect. And we could make it disappear smoothly when users clear the search bar.<p class="message sent">I'm on it! I'll start implementing the search bar with the animation effects. And you can work on the back-end to retrieve the data from the database.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Let's get to work then.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'm going to grab another cup of coffee first, though. Can I get you anything?<p class=message>Thanks for the offer, but I'm good for now. Let's get this feature built and tested so we can improve our users' experience.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1dc5eb3b-153c-4b81-897b-9e726a810676.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
