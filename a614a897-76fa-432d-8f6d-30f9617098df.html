My name is John and I manage this fishing port. How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, John. I'm Eric, and I work for a logistics company. We specialize in transporting goods, and I've been tasked with finding better ways to move your fish.<p class=message>That's great to hear, Eric. We always welcome new ideas to improve our operations. How can we work together?<p class="message sent">Well, we noticed that you are currently using ice to preserve the fish during transport. Have you considered using dry ice instead?<p class=message>Dry ice, eh? That's an excellent suggestion. What makes it better than regular ice?<p class="message sent">Dry ice can keep your fish colder, for a longer period of time. This would ensure that the fish retains its quality and freshness, which would be very important for your clients.<p class=message>I see. That's very important. Can you provide additional information about the cost and feasibility of dry ice?<p class="message sent">Yes, of course. We're willing to work with you to provide the best possible solution. We can have one of our engineers visit the port to help with the assessment.<p class=message>That would be fantastic! Thank you, Eric. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class="message sent">Yes, we could also use our specialized trucks to transport your fish directly to the clients. This would avoid any delays and ensure timely deliveries.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds great. What about the cost?<p class="message sent">Our company operates at a large scale, so we are able to offer very competitive rates. Plus, we can be very flexible with our pricing depending on the volume of fish you need to transport.<p class=message>That sounds promising. I'm definitely interested in working with you guys. Thank you for coming out to speak with me, Eric.<p class="message sent">No problem, John. It's always a pleasure to work with local businesses. I look forward to further discussions.<p class=message>Me too, Eric. Have a great day and drive safe!<p class="message sent">Thank you, John! Take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a6116645-3b39-4102-9ccd-c4d2af6d498c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
