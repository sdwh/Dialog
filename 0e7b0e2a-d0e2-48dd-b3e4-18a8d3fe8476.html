How about you?<p class=message>Same here! These reports always take so much time to write.<p class="message sent">Yeah, but it's important to get all the details right. What are some of the major findings you've come across?<p class=message>Well, we found that the company had a lot of weak passwords and some employees were using the same password for all their accounts.<p class="message sent">That's not good. Did you recommend they implement a password policy?<p class=message>Absolutely. We also found that some employees were using unsecured personal devices to access sensitive company information.<p class="message sent">Oh no. Did you suggest they provide company-issued devices instead?<p class=message>Definitely. They need to take better control of their IT assets.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. Any other major findings?<p class=message>We found that there was a lack of employee training on information security. Many of them didn't even know what phishing was!<p class="message sent">Yikes, that's worrying. Hopefully, the company will take steps to educate their employees.<p class=message>Agreed. It's all about creating a culture of security.<p class="message sent">Exactly. It's our job to ensure they have all the tools and knowledge to protect their assets.<p class=message>Well said. I think this report will definitely help them improve their cybersecurity posture.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's rewarding to see the impact of our work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0e78abbc-5bd3-48ef-9f69-a9db4103ffdb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
