Do you notice any trends in what products customers buy when they're placed next to each other?<p class=message>Absolutely. We've found that putting chips and dip together often leads to customers buying both, and the same goes for cereal and milk.<p class="message sent">Interesting. What about product placement at eye level versus lower or higher shelves?<p class=message>Eye level is definitely prime real estate. That's where we put our most popular products. But sometimes we'll put lesser-known but high-quality products at higher or lower levels to give them more visibility.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Do you ever rotate products to keep things fresh?<p class=message>Yes, we try to switch things up every few weeks to keep customers interested and to showcase new products.<p class="message sent">I see. And what about end-caps and promotional displays?<p class=message>Those are great for catching customers' attention and highlighting sales or seasonal items.<p class="message sent">Thanks for all the information. I'll be sure to include it in my research report.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. Let me know if you have any more questions or need any assistance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7f41c74f-6cf0-4caf-ae6a-39dbced7d92e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
