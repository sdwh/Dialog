What kind of birds are they?<p class=message>I'm not an expert in ornithology, but I think they might be sparrows or finches.<p class="message sent">I wish I could fly like them. That would be amazing.<p class=message>Oh, it definitely would be. But then again, you wouldn't be able to play video games or eat ice cream while flying.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I guess that's true. Hey, let's go to the swing set, I want to swing high!<p class=message>Sure thing. But be careful not to go too high, we don't want you to fly away like those birds!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Don't worry, dad, I won't fly away.<p class=message>You know, I used to love this playground when I was your age. It's cool to see you enjoying it too.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's awesome. Can we come back here again someday?<p class=message>Of course. How about we make it a weekly tradition?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! And next time we come, can we bring our dog, Buddy? He loves chasing squirrels.<p class=message>Haha, sure, as long as he doesn't bark too much and scare away the birds.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Don't worry, I'll keep him under control. Thanks for bringing me here, dad, I'm having so much fun.<p class=message>My pleasure, kiddo. Spending time with you is always the highlight of my week.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ff337a44-175a-4e58-b28e-bd260132acb1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
