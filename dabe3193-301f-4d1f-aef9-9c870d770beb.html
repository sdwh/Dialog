So, we're here today to discuss how we can use artificial intelligence to discover new drugs, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. AI has the potential to significantly speed up the discovery process by analyzing large amounts of data much faster than humans can.<p class=message>That's great! But I'm curious, how does AI actually go about discovering new drugs?<p class="message sent">Well, there are a few different methods. One is to use machine learning algorithms to identify relationships between various compounds and their effects on the human body.<p class=message>Fascinating! And what about natural compounds? Can AI help us discover those too?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. AI can search through massive databases of natural compounds and compare their structures and properties to find potential drug candidates.<p class=message>Wow, the possibilities are really endless. But how do we ensure the safety and effectiveness of these newly discovered drugs?<p class="message sent">That's where further testing and clinical trials come in. AI can help us narrow down potential candidates, but ultimately it's up to rigorous testing and evaluation to determine whether a new drug is safe and effective.<p class=message>I see. So it's a collaborative effort between humans and AI.<p class="message sent">Exactly. AI is a powerful tool, but it still requires human expertise and oversight to ensure the best outcomes.<p class=message>Well, I'm excited to see what kind of breakthroughs we can achieve with AI's help.<p class="message sent">Me too! It's an exciting time to be in the field of pharmaceutical research.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dabc3269-8875-4caf-8c6e-400c0c12f3d4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
