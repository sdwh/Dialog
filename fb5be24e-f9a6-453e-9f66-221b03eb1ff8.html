What brings you to this part of the woods?<p class="message sent">I'm on a quest to find a missing wizard. Have you seen anyone suspicious around here?<p class=message>Well, I did see a group of goblins scurrying around yesterday. Maybe they had something to do with it?<p class="message sent">Goblins, huh? That could be a lead. Do you mind if I join you on your hunt?<p class=message>Of course not! The more, the merrier. I'm actually an elf archer, so I could use your brawn in the fight.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good plan. I'm a warrior, so I'm not afraid of a little rough and tumble.<p class=message>Perfect! Let's set off then. Maybe we can ask some of the locals if they've seen anything suspicious lately.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We should also be on the lookout for any signs of magic. You never know what kind of tricks these wizards can pull.<p class=message>Good call. Maybe we can find some clues in the nearby town. They might have some information.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's a good idea. Maybe we can also stock up on some weapons and potions while we're there.<p class=message>Definitely. And maybe we'll even find some new allies to help us on our mission.<p class="message sent">Let's hope so. The sooner we find this wizard, the better. Who knows what kind of trouble he could be getting into.<p class=message>Agreed. But with our combined skills, I'm sure we can handle whatever comes our way.<p class="message sent">Ha! I like your confidence. Let's get going then. Time's a-wasting!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fb5472c8-de4c-4846-89bc-140fd09d4eac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
