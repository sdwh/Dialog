I'm excited to learn about traditional seafood dishes today.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Fisherman A! I'm glad you're eager to learn. What kind of seafood do you catch around here?<p class=message>Mostly lobsters and crabs, but we also have some delicious oysters and scallops.<p class="message sent">Those all sound perfect for today's lesson. We'll start with a classic lobster bisque. Do you know how to make a roux?<p class=message>I do, but I'm not very confident with it. Could you show me the proper technique?<p class="message sent">Of course! We'll make sure you're an expert before the end of the day. Next, we'll move on to a scallop ceviche. Have you ever made ceviche before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. I'm excited to try something new.<p class="message sent">Great! It's a refreshing and light dish that really highlights the flavor of the scallops. Finally, we'll finish with a crab linguine. It's a simple but satisfying pasta dish.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll make sure to bring some of my freshest crabs for it.<p class="message sent">Perfect! It's important to use the freshest ingredients when cooking seafood. Speaking of which, how do you store your catch when you're out at sea?<p class=message>We have a refrigerated hold on the boat to keep everything fresh.<p class="message sent">That's wonderful. It looks like we're ready to begin our lesson. Let's get started!<p class=message>Sounds like a plan, Chef B. I'm ready to get my hands dirty and learn some new techniques. Thank you for teaching me today.<p class="message sent">No problem, Fisherman A. It's my pleasure to share my love of cooking with others. Let's cook!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8c35d400-838b-4a07-a943-dd6caf4206c2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
