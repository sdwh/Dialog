How can I assist you with your legal concerns today, sir?<p class="message sent">Oh, thank you for asking. I'm actually here to get legal advice regarding my recent business deal.<p class=message>Alright, let's dive into it. Can you tell me more about the contract and what specifically needs legal advice?<p class="message sent">Yes, I just want to make sure that everything in the contract is in accordance with the law and that I won't be held liable for anything in the future. You know what they say, better safe than sorry.<p class=message>Of course, that's a wise mindset to have. I'll do my best to make sure that everything is in order.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. By the way, have you always wanted to become a lawyer?<p class=message>Actually, it was a childhood dream of mine. I never outgrew it, I guess! What about you, have you always wanted to be in business?<p class="message sent">Not really, but it's something I grew to love after getting my degree in Business Administration. You know what they say, "Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life".<p class=message>That's very true. It's important to have a passion for what you do, and I'm glad that we both found ours.<p class="message sent">Me too! I'm really glad to have you as my legal counsel. You're making everything so much easier for me.<p class=message>That's what I'm here for! It's my job to make sure that you get the legal advice and protection that you need.<p class="message sent">You're doing a fantastic job at that. Thank you so much!<p class=message>You're welcome, sir. It's a pleasure working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e9d845bf-f127-41b6-8b05-f0d8d1d46aee.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
