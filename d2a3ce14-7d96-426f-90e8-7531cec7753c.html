How's business been for you lately?<p class=message>It's been crazy busy, but I'm not complaining. There's been a lot of food orders lately.<p class="message sent">Well, that's definitely good to hear! Did you have any trouble finding us today?<p class=message>Not at all, your address was easy to find. Plus, the GPS on the delivery app was really helpful.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that! So, do you have any delivery horror stories?<p class=message>Oh boy, do I ever. Once, I delivered food to the wrong house and ended up in a completely different neighborhood.<p class="message sent">Yikes, that sounds like a nightmare. Did you ever find the right house?<p class=message>Eventually, after a lot of wandering around! Luckily, the customers were very understanding.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. Speaking of understanding customers, have you had any unusual orders lately?<p class=message>Hmm, let me think. I did have someone order a pizza with pickles and peanut butter once.<p class="message sent">Ew, that sounds absolutely disgusting. Did they say why they wanted that combination?<p class=message>Apparently it was a pregnancy craving. I try not to judge too much!<p class="message sent">I can only imagine what other strange food cravings pregnant people have. Well, thank you for the delivery and the entertaining conversation. Have a great day!<p class=message>No problem, thank you for ordering! Have a great day as well!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d2a0043f-1167-4533-b454-e5c91956f11e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
