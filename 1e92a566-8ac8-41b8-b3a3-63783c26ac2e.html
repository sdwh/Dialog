It's going pretty smooth so far. What do you think about our progress?<p class=message>I think we're on the right track. But we still need to iron out some bugs here and there.<p class="message sent">I totally agree. It's never an easy task. But with our knowledge and experience, we can certainly pull it off.<p class=message>You're right! And, it's always fun to work on something new.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! But I also hope that we can enjoy some downtime once this app is done.<p class=message>Hey, I heard that the new version of "Among Us" is coming out soon. Maybe we should plan for a game night with the team.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! We definitely need to unwind and let off some steam.<p class=message>Speaking of unwinding, have you watched the latest season of "Brooklyn Nine-Nine"?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. Is it any good?<p class=message>Yes! It's hilarious, and you'll definitely love it. You should give it a try.<p class="message sent">Okay, I definitely will. And you should try the new Thai restaurant that's just opened up. I heard their food is amazing.<p class=message>Really? I love Thai food. Let's plan for lunch there tomorrow?<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds like a plan. But we better finish this code first.<p class=message>Right. Let's get back to work then.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1e88f656-80b6-47dc-b8f4-e090513beef6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
