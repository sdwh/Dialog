What a lovely day to make candies, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! I'm excited to show you how we make traditional Chaozhou sweets.<p class=message>I am looking forward to it. What kind of candies are we making today?<p class="message sent">We'll be making "Kong Chai" candy, made from malt and peanuts. It's a unique and delicious candy.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. I've never tried this candy before.<p class="message sent">Don't worry; we'll make sure you get to taste it. Now, let's begin the process.<p class=message>Sure thing. I'm ready.<p class="message sent">First, we put the malt syrup into the pot and cook it until it becomes caramelized.<p class=message>Wow, that color looks amazing. It smells amazing too!<p class="message sent">Yes, the caramelization process brings out the sweet aroma. Now let's add the peanuts.<p class=message>It looks like it might be difficult to stir. Can I give it a try?<p class="message sent">Of course you can. Just be careful not to burn yourself.<p class=message>This is so much fun! I feel like a candy chef.<p class="message sent">You're doing great. Keep stirring until the mixture is evenly coated.<p class=message>Okay, it looks perfect. Now what do we do?<p class="message sent">We pour the mixture onto the table and use a metal scraper to flatten and stretch it out.<p class=message>This reminds me of playing with Play-Doh when I was a kid.<p class="message sent">It's a similar concept. We need to work quickly before the candy cools and hardens.<p class=message>Wow, we did it! This looks amazing. Can we try it now?<p class="message sent">Yes, let's have a taste. How do you like it?<p class=message>This is amazing! Thank you for showing me how to make this delicious candy.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. It was fun to work with you. Would you like to come back and make more candy with me sometime?<p class=message>Yes, I would love to! Thank you again for this wonderful experience.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ca92e07d-ca66-487d-bf13-c15d707be3f0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
