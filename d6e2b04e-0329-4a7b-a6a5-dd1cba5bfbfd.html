How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey, A. Just trying to get through this ISO 27001 audit. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. Say, have you found any interesting security vulnerabilities so far?<p class="message sent">Well, I did find one system where the password was set to 'password'. It was so bad it was almost funny.<p class=message>(laughs) Yeah, I can see why. Did you let them know they needed to change it?<p class="message sent">Of course! I sent a friendly reminder email immediately.<p class=message>Good call. Any other funny things you've run into?<p class="message sent">Actually, yeah. One of the employees had a Post-it note on their monitor with their password. Talk about a security risk!<p class=message>(chuckles) I guess some people need a little help remembering their passwords. But yeah, definitely not good.<p class="message sent">So true. Hey, have you seen the break room? They've got some pretty good snacks in there.<p class=message>(smiling) Oh yes, I made sure to check that out. Those chocolate chip cookies were divine.<p class="message sent">I've got my eye on those Doritos. But first, let's finish up this audit before we get too sidetracked.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's see what else we can uncover. Hopefully nothing too ridiculous.<p class="message sent">(laughs) No kidding. But hey, if we do find anything, at least it'll make for an interesting story to tell later.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d6e21c06-7547-4841-b70d-c02ce1e1ca1c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
