Let's see if we can catch us some game.<p class="message sent">Agreed! I'm excited to see what we can find in these woods. What kind of game are you hoping to catch?<p class=message>I'm thinking some wild boar or maybe a deer if we're lucky. What about you?<p class="message sent">I'm open to anything, but I've always wanted to try cooking rabbit. Do you think we'll come across any?<p class=message>There's a good chance. Those little guys can be pretty fast, but I think we can handle it.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's split up and see what we can find. Meet back at the campsite in a few hours?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Good luck out there!<p class="message sent">Welcome back! Did you have any luck?<p class=message>I managed to catch a wild boar. It's a big one, so we should have plenty of meat for dinner tonight.<p class="message sent">That's excellent! I found some mushrooms and berries too, so we can make a delicious side dish.<p class=message>Sounds like a great meal. Shall we get started on cleaning and preparing the meat?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I've got a few different ideas on how to cook it. What kind of flavors do you like?<p class=message>I'm a fan of savory herbs, like rosemary or thyme. But I'm open to trying new things too.<p class="message sent">How about we make a rub with those herbs, some garlic, and a bit of olive oil? Then we can roast the boar on a spit over the fire.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. I'll get started on the spit while you work on the rub.<p class="message sent">Great! Let's get cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e17b82d-3709-46f9-b11a-881ed9fc4138.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
