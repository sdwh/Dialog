It's great to be in Okinawa and learn about their unique cuisine and drinks.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A. I'm so excited to learn and bring back some new flavors to our restaurant.<p class=message>Have you tried the Okinawan sweet potato shochu? It's got a distinct taste that I think our customers will love.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't, but I'm definitely up for trying it out. Have you had the chance to try Orion beer yet?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's easily one of my new favorites. I love how crisp and refreshing it is.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Maybe we can incorporate it into a new cocktail at our restaurant.<p class=message>Speaking of cocktails, have you tried awamori? It's a traditional Okinawan drink made from long-grain rice and it has a smooth taste.<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! I think it would be perfect to mix with some fruit juices to give it a modern twist.<p class=message>I completely agree! What about food? Have you tried the famous Okinawan soba yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's so delicious and full of flavor. I think we should definitely add it to our menu.<p class=message>I was also thinking about incorporating goya, the bitter melon, into some of our dishes. It's one of Okinawa's signature ingredients.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea, A. It's definitely an acquired taste, but it would be worth it to introduce it to our customers.<p class=message>I'm glad we're on the same page. Learning about the food and drinks here has been so enlightening.<p class="message sent">It really has, A. I'm so grateful for this opportunity to expand our culinary horizons.<p class=message>Me too, B. Let's make the most of our remaining time here and bring back some amazing new flavors for our restaurant.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A. I can't wait to see what we come up with!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e15a173b-6986-46de-a694-b9a838bbc217.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
