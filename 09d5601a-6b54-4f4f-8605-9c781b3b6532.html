Welcome to the Statue of Liberty. Are you excited to take some photos in front of the iconic statue?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I am! This is my first trip to New York and I couldn't wait to see the Statue of Liberty up close.<p class="message received message-content">Well, you're in for a treat. Did you know that Lady Liberty is made of copper and stands at 151 feet tall?<p class="message sent message-content">Wow, I didn't know that.
