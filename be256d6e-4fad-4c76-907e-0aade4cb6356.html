I just can't wait to film today's vlog.<p class="message sent">Welcome to Kiyomizu-dera, my name is Takashi and I'll be your guide today. Are you ready to explore the temple?<p class=message>Definitely, I can't wait to see the amazing views from up here. By the way, your English is very good!<p class="message sent">Thank you very much, I've been practicing for a long time. So, what do you want to film first?<p class=message>Let's start with the main hall, and then we can film the famous three streams and try some tea at the teahouse. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That sounds great. The main hall is one of the most popular spots. You'll definitely capture some great shots there.<p class=message>Yeah, and I heard there's a special way of making a wish at the temple. Can you tell me more about that?<p class="message sent">Sure, it's called "neri-kiri" and it involves throwing a coin into a small shrine, then closing your eyes and walking to the other side. If you make it, your wish will come true.<p class=message>Wow, that's really interesting! I'll definitely include that in my vlog.<p class="message sent">Great, and don't forget to try some of the famous Kyoto sweets. You can find them at the shops on the way down.<p class=message>Of course, I won't miss that! This place is really amazing. I can't wait to share my experience with my followers.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you're enjoying it. Kyoto has so much to offer, and Kiyomizu-dera is just one of the many beautiful temples in the city.<p class=message>Absolutely, I'll definitely come back to explore more. And I have to say, your role as a guide has made this trip even more enjoyable. Thanks for everything!<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, I'm happy to show visitors like you the beauty of my city. Have a safe trip back home!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=be24b6d5-e872-4290-8fdb-ac0c4858918f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
