Where can I take you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Please take me to the Willis Tower.<p class=message>Sure thing! But before we head out, I'd like to make sure you're aware of the traffic rules in Chicago. Have you been here before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But I do know that the US drives on the right side of the road.<p class=message>That's right! Also, I should let you know that it's against the law to text while driving in Chicago. And if you're going to be driving here, watch out for the pedestrian crosswalks!<p class="message sent">Thanks for the heads up! What about turns?<p class=message>If you're making a right turn, make sure to stop at the stop line before the crosswalk. And for left turns, you can turn at any time as long as it's a one-way street.<p class="message sent">Got it! And what about parking? I've heard that it can be hard to find a good spot.<p class=message>Yes, especially downtown. Make sure to pay attention to the signs that tell you when you can and can't park. And if you see a yellow curb, that means no parking or stopping!<p class="message sent">Thanks for all of the info! I feel much more prepared now.<p class=message>No problem! Just want to make sure everyone stays safe on the road. Alright, we're off to the Willis Tower. Enjoy the view!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7a9830aa-d1a8-4e72-9bde-4202c91ee357.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
