The restaurant is busy tonight, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's been quite hectic, but I'm enjoying every moment serving our guests.<p class=message>That's great to hear. By the way, have you tried the new menu items that I've added this week?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes. I've tasted the duck confit and the lobster bisque, and they were both exquisite.<p class=message>Excellent. And have you paired them with any wines yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, for the duck confit, I chose a rich red wine, and for the bisque, I went with a crisp white wine.<p class=message>You really know your stuff, B. Speaking of wine, have you heard about the new wine bar that just opened down the street?<p class="message sent">Yes, I heard about it. But honestly, they'll have a hard time competing with our amazing wine selection.<p class=message>(laughs) I think so too. So, what's new with you? Have you planned any trips for the upcoming holidays?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm thinking of staying in town and exploring more of the city. Maybe I'll finally visit the Eiffel Tower.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. Don't forget to stop by the bakery next door for some delicious croissants.<p class="message sent">I definitely won't. Do you want me to bring some back for the kitchen staff?<p class=message>Absolutely. They deserve a treat. Well, we better get back to work.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It was nice catching up with you, A.<p class=message>Likewise, B. Have a great evening.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=67fae72c-7604-44c8-90fd-67436372f984.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
