Did the patients turn out okay?<p class=message>Thankfully, they did. The doctor and nurse quickly realized their mistake and switched back to their respective roles.<p class="message sent">That’s a relief. I can’t imagine being a patient and waking up to find the doctor holding a scalpel and the nurse holding a dosage of anesthetic.<p class=message>Yeah, it would be a bit disconcerting. But knowing those two, they probably made light of the situation and joked around to ease the tension.<p class="message sent">That’s one of the things I love about people in the healthcare industry. They have a great sense of humor and know how to make the best of any situation.<p class=message>Absolutely. They work hard, but they also know how to have fun and keep things light, even in the most serious of circumstances.<p class="message sent">That’s why I’m grateful for all the doctors and nurses out there. They’re a special breed of people who can turn a stressful situation into something that’s manageable and even enjoyable.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=33e02727-7b0e-4ed0-8e88-144f254bedb5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
