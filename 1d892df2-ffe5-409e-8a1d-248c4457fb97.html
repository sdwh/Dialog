Have you spoken with the seller about this?<p class="message sent">Yes, but they refuse to do anything about it. What legal options do I have?<p class=message>Well, we can certainly look into filing a lawsuit for breach of contract. However, before we go down that road, let's see if we can come to a resolution through mediation.<p class="message sent">Mediation? What's that?<p class=message>It's a process where a neutral third party helps facilitate a discussion between the two parties to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds like a good idea. How does it work?<p class=message>We would schedule a meeting with the seller and a mediator, and we would each have the opportunity to present our case and discuss possible solutions.<p class="message sent">Sounds fair. So, when can we get started?<p class=message>I'll reach out to the seller and see if they're interested in mediation. Once we have a date, I'll let you know.<p class="message sent">Great, thank you so much for your help.<p class=message>You're welcome. In the meantime, make sure to keep all relevant documents, such as the contract and any receipts for repairs you've had to make.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks again, I appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to reach out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1d86d298-ff13-4d36-bdcb-ecf8a06b89ef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
