Is there something wrong?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon, sir. Yes, unfortunately there appears to be a problem. I noticed you just drove past a DO NOT ENTER sign.<p class=message>Oh, I didn't even see it. My bad!<p class="message sent">It happens. But just so you know, that sign means that the road is closed off and you can't enter. It's for your own safety.<p class=message>I understand, officer. I'll make sure to pay closer attention from now on.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that. Safety should always be our top priority, don't you agree?<p class=message>Definitely. So, am I going to receive a ticket or something?<p class="message sent">No, I'm just going to give you a warning this time. But please be careful and watch out for those road signs. They're there to guide and protect us.<p class=message>Thank you for letting me off easy, officer. Can I ask you a question? What's the weirdest road sign you've ever seen?<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's a good question. I once saw a sign that said "Caution: Sloth Crossing." It was in a rainforest area where sloths are known to hang out. I thought it was pretty amusing.<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious! I've never seen a sloth in the wild before. Maybe the sign was just a trick to lure us in.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Who knows? In any case, be careful out there and always watch out for those road signs.<p class=message>Will do, officer. Thanks for the advice!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, and drive safe!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=63d6414a-7374-45af-bb19-4c2d93187351.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
