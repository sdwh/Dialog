How long have you been driving taxis?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Oh, it's been quite a while. I've been driving taxis for about 10 years now.<p class=message>Wow, that's quite an achievement. I'm headed to Kaohsiung for a business meeting. It'll be a long ride, but do you know any good spots to stop along the way?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! There's this great rest stop just a few kilometers from here. They have the best coffee and pastries in the area.<p class=message>That sounds great! I could use some caffeine to start the day. Have you tried their coffee before?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes. I'm a regular there. In fact, they know my order by heart.<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious. It must be nice to have a place that feels like home.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's the little things that make life enjoyable.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more! Speaking of little things, do you have any favorite hobbies outside of driving?<p class="message sent">As a matter of fact, I do. I love to fish whenever I have some free time. It's my way of relaxing and escaping from the city noise.<p class=message>That sounds really peaceful. I can imagine the calmness of the ocean has a soothing effect.<p class="message sent">Exactly, it's really therapeutic. Time seems to slow down when I'm waiting for the fish to bite.<p class=message>I can understand that. We all need a way to unwind after a long day. It's important to find what works for us.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! So, do you have any hobbies yourself, sir?<p class=message>Well, I'm a foodie. I love trying new restaurants and exploring the local cuisine wherever I go. It's always a fun adventure.<p class="message sent">That's cool! There are so many great restaurants in Kaohsiung. You're in for a treat.<p class=message>I can't wait! It's always exciting to try new dishes and flavors. Who knows? Maybe I'll find my new favorite cuisine.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's the spirit! You never know what you'll discover. Enjoy the ride, sir.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3eeec24e-76c8-4518-aa07-2755a3190d7b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
