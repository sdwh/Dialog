How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi A. I'm having a bit of an issue with my landlord.<p class=message>Oh no, what's going on?<p class="message sent">Well, we signed a lease and he's been raising my rent every month.<p class=message>Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Let me take a look at your lease agreement.<p class="message sent">Sure, here you go.<p class=message>Okay, it looks like there's no clause that allows for rent increases during the lease term. We can definitely bring this up with your landlord and get it sorted out.<p class="message sent">That's great news! I was worried I would have to move out.<p class=message>No need to worry, B. We'll make sure your rights as a tenant are protected.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. I really appreciate your help.<p class=message>Of course, that's what I'm here for. Now let's get to work on drafting a letter to send to your landlord.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Do you need me to do anything else?<p class=message>Just sit back, relax, and let me handle everything. And by the way, have you seen the latest episode of that legal drama show?<p class="message sent">Yes! I'm actually addicted to it. Do you watch it too?<p class=message>Absolutely. It's so unrealistic, but so entertaining.<p class="message sent">I know, right? I wish real cases were that glamorous.<p class=message>Me too, but unfortunately, the reality is less exciting than the TV version.<p class="message sent">Well, thanks again for your help, A. I'll see you soon.<p class=message>You're welcome, B. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0445b8ac-595d-45aa-bfad-2b2cddc0a41b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
