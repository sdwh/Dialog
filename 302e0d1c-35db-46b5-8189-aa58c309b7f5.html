How's business today?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too! It's been pretty steady so far. How about you guys?<p class=message>Can't complain! People love their coffee in the morning, and we've been keeping them happy.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Have you tried our new lemon meringue cake yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but it sounds delicious. Is it selling well?<p class="message sent">It's been a hit so far. I'm actually thinking of making some mini versions for people to grab and go.<p class=message>That's a great idea! I'm sure people would love to have a quick bite of something sweet with their coffee.<p class="message sent">Speaking of coffee, have you tried any new blends lately?<p class=message>Have you heard of the Ethiopian Yirgacheffe? We just got it in and I'm in love with it.<p class="message sent">Oh, I've heard great things about that one. Can I try a cup?<p class=message>Of course! Let me grab you one.<p class="message sent">Mmm, that's really good. It's just the right amount of acidity and sweetness.<p class=message>I'm glad you like it. It pairs perfectly with that lemon meringue cake you were telling me about.<p class="message sent">You're right, it does! We should recommend that combo to customers.<p class=message>Absolutely. And if you have any other new flavors, let me know so I can suggest more pairings.<p class="message sent">Will do, and let me know if you want to do any collaborations. I'm always down to mix things up.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Both of our businesses benefit that way.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Thanks, A!<p class=message>Of course, B. Have a great day and let's keep the deliciousness flowing!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=302d7d71-9e41-4f05-8db8-5dbe647bf7d9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
