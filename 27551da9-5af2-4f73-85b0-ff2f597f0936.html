Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi A, pleased to meet you too. I'm B, the photographer for this shoot.<p class=message>Great, I'm excited to get started. What's the theme for the shoot?<p class="message sent">We're shooting for a watch brand, so we're focusing on wrist and hand shots.<p class=message>Ah, I see. So, what poses do you have in mind for the shots?<p class="message sent">I was thinking we could do a few different ones. Maybe one with the watch strapped to your wrist and your hand resting on your hip.<p class=message>That sounds cool. Any other ideas?<p class="message sent">Yeah, for some close-up shots, we could have your hand holding the watch up and maybe one with your wrist and the watch in focus while the rest of the image is blurred.<p class=message>Yeah, that sounds good too. I think I have a few ideas as well. Do you mind if I suggest some poses?<p class="message sent">Not at all, I'm open to any suggestions.<p class=message>How about a shot of me with my wrist lying on a table and the watch next to it?<p class="message sent">That could work. We could also try a shot of you applying lotion to your hands and having the watch be the focal point in the background.<p class=message>Oh, that's a great idea! I like that.<p class="message sent">Glad you do. Let's get started then, shall we?<p class=message>Yes, let's do this! I'm ready for my close-up.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2751ddfb-59cd-427d-ab87-40a1a648ab02.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
