How's everyone feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, sir! I'm feeling great today. How about you?<p class=message>I'm feeling pretty good too. So, before we start with the lesson, does anyone have any fun plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">I'm planning to go on a weekend road trip with my family. We're going to the beach!<p class=message>Oh nice! Which beach are you headed to?<p class="message sent">We're going to Malibu. It's my first time there, so I'm pretty excited!<p class=message>That sounds like a great plan. Any other exciting plans?<p class=message>Wow, that's pretty adventurous! Be sure to stay safe and enjoy the experience.<p class=message>That's a good plan too. Sometimes a relaxing weekend is all you need. Okay, let's get started with today's lesson.<p class=message>Of course, we'll take a break halfway through the class. But make sure you're all paying attention!<p class=message>Great, let's begin. Today we'll be talking about the different parts of speech in the English language.<p class="message sent">Oh no, grammar lessons are always a nightmare for me!<p class=message>Don't worry, we'll take it slow and steady. By the end of this class, you'll all be experts in English grammar!<p class=message>Absolutely! We'll play some grammar games during our next class.<p class=message>Alright, let's begin with nouns...<p class=message>And that wraps up our lesson for today. Halfway break time, everyone!<p class="message sent">Oh thank goodness. This stuff is making my head spin!<p class=message>That sounds like a plan. I'd love to hear about how everyone's weekends went!<p class=message>Okay, time to get back to the lesson. Are you all ready?<p class=message>Great job, everyone! You all did really well. See you next week!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9aae99dd-091d-4a91-bf69-c916dddfb06e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
