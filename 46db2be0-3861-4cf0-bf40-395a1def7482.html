I heard that you're working on a new game for the Nintendo Switch. Can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Hi! Sure thing. We're working on a puzzle-platformer with a twist. The protagonist is a sloth who moves really slowly.<p class=message>A sloth? That's quite unconventional. How does that work exactly?<p class="message sent">Well, the sloth moves at a snail's pace, but players can control other aspects of the environment to help the sloth progress through the levels.<p class=message>Interesting! Can you give me an example?<p class="message sent">Sure. The player might have to manipulate trees or vines to create a path for the sloth to traverse. Or they might have to use a gust of wind to blow the sloth across gaps.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. Are there any other unique features in the game?<p class="message sent">Yes, there's a co-op mode where one player controls the sloth and the other player controls the environment. It's a great way to work together and find new solutions to the puzzles.<p class=message>Wow, that's really cool. I can see this becoming a hit on the Switch. When can we expect to see it released?<p class="message sent">We're hoping to release it in a few months. We're still fine-tuning some aspects of the game, but we're really excited to share it with the world.<p class=message>I can't wait to give it a try. Do you have any other games in the works?<p class="message sent">We're always working on new ideas! Right now, we're brainstorming a game where the player is a cat trying to catch mice. But there's a catch â€“ the player can only see in black and white.<p class=message>Oh wow, those are some really creative ideas. I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with next. Thanks for chatting with me!<p class="message sent">No problem, thanks for your interest in our games!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=46d7d4c2-ed48-4b17-8f3b-541c3ebd0f69.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
