How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm great, thank you for asking. So, let's talk about our upcoming shows.<p class=message>Sure thing! I'm excited to hear what you've got planned.<p class="message sent">Okay, so I've booked you for a stand-up comedy show next month. It's at a college campus, should be a fun audience.<p class=message>Awesome, that sounds like a blast. Any specific things I should keep in mind for this show?<p class="message sent">Be sure to avoid any offensive material, and try to tie in some jokes related to college life.<p class=message>Got it, definitely want to keep it clean and relatable. What else have you got in the works?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm trying to book you for a corporate event next week. They want you to perform some of your comedic songs, any suggestions?<p class=message>Maybe we could do a medley of songs that poke fun at office culture. I have a few ideas brewing.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect, I'll let them know. And last but not least, I'm in talks with a TV network about a potential sitcom for you.<p class=message>Wow, that's exciting news! What's the concept?<p class="message sent">It's still in the early stages, but they're looking for a show that showcases your comedic talents as a quirky and relatable character.<p class=message>That's fantastic, I can't wait to hear more. Thanks for keeping me busy, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A.
