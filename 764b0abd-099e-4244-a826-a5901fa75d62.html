I hope you slept well last night.<p class="message sent">Actually, Officer, the bed they gave me was as hard as a rock. I don't think I'll be requesting a reservation anytime soon.<p class=message>Well, it's not the Ritz, that's for sure. So, let's get down to business. What can you tell me about your whereabouts at the time of the crime?<p class="message sent">I was at home binge-watching Stranger Things. I have witnesses--Dustin, Mike, Lucas and Eleven.<p class=message>Uh-huh. And were any of these "witnesses" human beings?<p class="message sent">Well, no. But they're my friends.<p class=message>I see. Now, you do realize that lying to a police officer is a serious offense punishable by law, right?<p class="message sent">Of course, Officer. But in all honesty, I really was watching Stranger Things. It's my alibi.<p class=message>(chuckles) You know, I've been meaning to catch up on that show but I just don't have the time. Is it really that good?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's amazing. You'll get hooked after the first episode. Maybe we can watch it together before the trial.<p class=message>(laughs) I don't think that would be the best idea. But thanks for the offer. Now, let's get back to the investigation.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=76442207-3a6a-450f-9054-136fcd5b61ca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
