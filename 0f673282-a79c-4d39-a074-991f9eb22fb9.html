No, what's that?<p class=message>It's this Australian snack that's sort of like a spring roll, but with a meat filling.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting. Is it any good?<p class=message>Definitely! It's a popular snack down under. They're pretty tasty and easy to eat.<p class="message sent">I'm always up for trying new things. Where can I get some?<p class=message>There's a grocery store down the road that sells them. Want to grab some later and give them a try?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Are they spicy at all?<p class=message>Not really. They're seasoned with a blend of spices, but nothing too overpowering.<p class="message sent">Perfect. I can't handle too much heat.<p class=message>Same here. So, do you prefer your rolls with a dipping sauce or just on their own?<p class="message sent">I think a dipping sauce would add to the flavor. What do you recommend?<p class=message>I usually go for sweet chili sauce, but they're commonly served with soy sauce or even BBQ sauce!<p class="message sent">Sweet chili sauce it is! I can't wait to try these Chiko Rolls.<p class=message>They're a popular choice for parties and get-togethers. Who knows, maybe we'll start a new trend here in the States!<p class="message sent">I'm down for that. We'll have to spread the word.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0f618ad5-446b-4c4e-a29c-1a36ec4cb7b4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
