I have been travelling a lot lately.<p class="message sent">Sure! I can definitely help you with that. Can I have your name and frequent flyer number please?<p class=message>Of course. My name is John and my frequent flyer number is ABC123.<p class="message sent">Alright, John. Let me check on that for you. Looks like you've collected quite a lot of miles these past few months. Have you been travelling for business or pleasure?<p class=message>Mostly for business but I always try to squeeze in some leisure time when I can.<p class="message sent">That's a great way to balance work and play. Have you been to any interesting destinations recently?<p class=message>Yes, I went to Hawaii last month for a conference but was able to explore the island on the weekends. It was beautiful.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing. I've always wanted to visit Hawaii. Did you try any local food or activities?<p class=message>Yes, I tried surfing for the first time and it was so much fun! I also had some amazing poke bowls.<p class="message sent">Sounds like you had quite the adventure. Well, your miles accumulation looks good and you have enough to redeem for a flight or some other rewards.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Thanks for your help, B.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, John. Have a great day and happy travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=17e8c5e7-d987-411e-99b9-0437ca6e19bd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
