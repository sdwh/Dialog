Plus, we can also transport your catch internationally if you're interested.<p class=message>Wow! That would be amazing. Are there any specific requirements we need to meet before we can start working with you?<p class="message sent">Yes, we need to ensure that the quality of your catch meets our standards. We also require proper documentation and permits for transportation.<p class=message>Noted. We will work on fulfilling those requirements. Is there anything else you suggest we should consider?<p class="message sent">Yes, we suggest you invest in quality packaging for your catch. This will ensure that the products won't get damaged during transportation.<p class=message>That makes sense. We'll look into it. Is there anything else your company can provide us with?<p class="message sent">Yes, we can take care of all the paperwork involved in transportation, which can be time-consuming for you. Plus, we also offer insurance for your products during transit.<p class=message>Your company seems to have everything we need. How long does it usually take for the transportation process to complete?<p class="message sent">It depends on the distance and the mode of transportation, but we will ensure that your products reach their destination as quickly and safely as possible.<p class=message>You've been extremely helpful. We appreciate your support and look forward to working with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise, we're excited to partner with you and help you distribute your excellent seafood products.
