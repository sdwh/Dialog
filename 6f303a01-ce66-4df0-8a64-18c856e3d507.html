Joining me today is the lovely and talented B. How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thank you so much for having me here today.<p class=message>So, B, you've had quite the successful year so far. Can you tell us a little bit about that?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been really fortunate to have some exciting opportunities come my way. I recently finished filming a new movie and I also released a new album that has been doing really well.<p class=message>Wow, that's incredible. So, what can we expect from your new movie?<p class="message sent">The movie is a romantic comedy about two people who meet on a plane and fall in love. It's really cute and I had so much fun filming it.<p class=message>That sounds like the perfect date night movie! And your new album, what was your inspiration behind it?<p class="message sent">I wanted to explore some new sounds and styles with this album. I incorporated some pop and R&B influences and wrote a lot of personal lyrics. It was a really cathartic experience.<p class=message>I can't wait to listen to it. Let's switch gears a bit, shall we? I heard you're quite the foodie. What's your favorite cuisine?<p class="message sent">Oh, I love trying new foods and exploring different cultures through their cuisine. But if I had to pick a favorite, I'd say Italian food is my go-to.<p class=message>Good choice! Do you have a favorite dish?<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely. I love a classic spaghetti carbonara, but I also have a weakness for pizza.<p class=message>Same here, pizza is always a good idea! Well, it looks like we're out of time. B, thank you so much for joining us today and sharing your experiences.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, it was a pleasure to be here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6f2eeb64-9cec-45d5-82b3-671f4ba76b72.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
