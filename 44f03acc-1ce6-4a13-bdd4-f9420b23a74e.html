It's good to see you.<p class="message sent">Hi, A! Yeah, it's been a while. So, what are we discussing today?<p class=message>We're talking about protecting our company's network system from hackers. Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Well, first and foremost, we need to make sure our software and operating systems are up to date.<p class=message>Right, I've heard that hackers often target outdated systems. We should also make sure our firewalls are strong enough to ward off any unwanted breaches.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we can also implement multi-factor authentication for added security.<p class=message>That's a good idea. And we should also train our employees to be more aware of phishing scams and suspicious emails.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. They are often the weakest link in the security chain. On a lighter note, have you seen any good tech movies lately?<p class=message>Actually, I watched "The Social Dilemma" on Netflix recently. It was eye-opening about the dangers of social media and data privacy.<p class="message sent">I've heard about that one. I'll have to check it out. Speaking of data privacy, let's make sure we encrypt our sensitive files and use strong passwords as well.<p class=message>Definitely. And let's not forget to regularly back up our data, so we can quickly recover from any potential attacks.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And if all else fails, we can always call in a team of IT security experts to help us out.<p class=message>Ha, let's hope it doesn't come to that! But it's good to know we have that backup plan.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Well, it's been a great discussion. Thanks for chatting, A.<p class=message>Always a pleasure, B. Take care and stay safe out there!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=44eed49f-9038-4fb8-a8b8-9bb90f2b990f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
