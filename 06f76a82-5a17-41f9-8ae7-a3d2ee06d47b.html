How are you feeling?<p class="message sent">Oh, good morning, doctor. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest.<p class=message>That's understandable. But don't worry, we're here to take care of you. Is there anything you'd like to ask before we begin?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. Will I be awake during the surgery?<p class=message>No, we're going to give you some anesthesia, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure.<p class="message sent">That's a relief. Can I listen to music while you work?<p class=message>Of course! We have some headphones and a playlist ready for you.<p class="message sent">That's great. Any chance I can request some classic rock?<p class=message>Absolutely. What's your favorite band?<p class="message sent">Led Zeppelin.<p class=message>Ah, a man of good taste. We'll make sure to play some Zeppelin for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you, doctor. You know, this is my first time having surgery.<p class=message>I understand, but don't worry, you're in good hands. We do this every day, and we'll make sure everything goes smoothly.<p class="message sent">I appreciate your reassurance. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the surgery?<p class=message>Just follow our instructions regarding fasting and medication, and make sure you have someone to take you home afterwards. Oh, and try to relax and take deep breaths.<p class="message sent">I'll do my best. Thanks again, doctor.<p class=message>You're welcome, Mr. B. Are you ready to start?<p class="message sent">Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=06f5dea5-461f-4429-afe2-443355054ced.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
