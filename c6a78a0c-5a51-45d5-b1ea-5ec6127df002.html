How's your day going?<p class="message sent">Pretty good so far. Just getting started on some new development work. How about you?<p class=message>Same here - I'm just diving into our Github repo to see if there are any new pull requests that need my attention.<p class="message sent">Speaking of Github, have you seen the new dark mode they just added? It's so much easier on the eyes.<p class=message>Yes, I've been loving it ever since I switched over. I had to customize my editor and terminal color schemes to match though.<p class="message sent">Oh, nice! I've been meaning to do that too. Maybe you could send me your theme files so I can save some time?<p class=message>Sure thing, I'll message them to you later. Do you have any personal projects you're working on right now?<p class="message sent">Actually, yeah! I'm trying to build a small automated testing suite for one of our apps. It's been a bit of a challenge, but I'm learning a lot in the process.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. Maybe we can work together on it sometime. I've been wanting to improve my testing skills too.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Maybe we can grab some lunch first though. I heard there's a new ramen place that just opened up nearby.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let's finish up what we're working on now and head out in an hour or so.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I'm just glad we get to enjoy a little bit of work-life balance every now and then.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c6a60823-20d8-4345-8f8a-8ce4aa4ba826.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
