Actually, I'm from the car rental company and I wanted to ask about your procedures for renting a car here.<p class=message>Sure thing! We have a few rental companies around the area, but they usually have their own process. For instance, do you have a reservation already?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do. We have a few clients coming in from out of town and they would need a car to travel around.<p class=message>In that case, is it alright if I see your reservation details and guide you towards the pick-up location?<p class="message sent">That would actually be a great help, thanks! By the way, do you have any recommendations for places to visit around here?<p class=message>Definitely! There's a popular tourist spot about 20 minutes from here that has great views of the beach.<p class="message sent">That sounds lovely! Is there anywhere we can grab a bite to eat over there?<p class=message>Absolutely, there's a small but delicious seafood shack nearby that is a must-try.<p class="message sent">Wow, you really know your way around here! Thanks again for the tips.<p class=message>No problem, always happy to help out!<p class="message sent">Do you happen to know if there are any tolls we may encounter along the way?<p class=message>Yes, there is a toll on the highway, but don't worry as you can pay it through an automated machine with your rental car's license plate.<p class="message sent">Excellent, we'll make sure to keep that in mind. Once again, thanks a lot for your help!<p class=message>You're welcome! Have a great trip and do let me know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c41c3972-f7c3-413c-a100-642484cc27f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
