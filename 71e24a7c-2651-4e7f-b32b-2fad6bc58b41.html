Welcome to our yoga class. Let's all take a deep breath and begin.<p class="message sent">(breathing heavily) I'm sorry, I'm a little out of breath.<p class=message>No worries, just breathe at your own pace. Are you new to yoga?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've never done it before. I hope I don't embarrass myself.<p class=message>Nonsense, everyone starts somewhere. The important thing is to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard.<p class="message sent">That's reassuring. What benefits will I get from yoga?<p class=message>Well, it can help reduce stress and increase flexibility, among other things. But let's not focus on that too much. Let's just enjoy the movements and the music.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I'm definitely enjoying the music. It's so soothing.<p class=message>It's a Spotify playlist of my own making. I'm glad you like it. Okay class, let's move into downward-facing dog.<p class="message sent">(struggling) I don't think I can do that.<p class=message>No worries, just try your best. If you need to modify the pose, bring yourself down to your knees.<p class="message sent">(relieved) That's much better. I think I can manage this.<p class=message>And that's great! Remember, there's no competition in yoga. It's all about being present in the moment and listening to your body.<p class="message sent">(smiling) I'm starting to understand that now.<p class=message>(smiling back) That's the spirit. Let's finish up with one more deep breath.<p class="message sent">(inhales and exhales) I feel so relaxed now. Thank you, teacher.<p class=message>You're welcome, student. Keep practicing and you'll see more benefits over time. Namaste.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=71df9841-8748-4e33-915e-d06c64feab1d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
