What about it?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of using Vue.js for the front-end development. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Hmm, interesting choice. But I was planning on using ASP.NET MVC 5 for the back-end. How do you think they'll work together?<p class=message>I think they'll complement each other well. Vue.js has great data-binding capabilities and ASP.NET MVC has strong server-side processing power.<p class="message sent">That sounds promising. I'm excited to see how this turns out. By the way, are you fluent in Vue.js?<p class=message>Yes, I've worked with Vue.js a lot in my previous job. It's a pretty user-friendly framework.<p class="message sent">Good to know. I'm more experienced in ASP.NET MVC, so we've got both ends covered.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm also hoping to implement some cool animations and transitions with Vue.js.<p class="message sent">Sounds like we'll be creating a dynamic and visually appealing website.<p class=message>Definitely. I'm also looking forward to optimizing the website's loading speed.<p class="message sent">That's important. We don't want to keep our colleagues waiting too long to access crucial information.<p class=message>Agreed. I think we make a great team, combining our knowledge and skills.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more, A. Let's get started on this project and make it the best internal website system our company has ever had!<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's show everyone what we're capable of.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=54930e04-324d-45a2-aeac-4a559584e365.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
