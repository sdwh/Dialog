So, are you excited to explore Melbourne today?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I can't wait to learn about Australian history and culture.<p class=message>Great! We have a lot to cover then. Did you know that Melbourne was the capital city of Australia for a brief period of time?<p class="message sent">Really? I had no idea!<p class=message>Yes, it was for five years, from 1901 to 1906, before the capital was moved to Canberra. Melbourne has a rich history to explore, including the gold rush era.<p class="message sent">That's fascinating! I'm eager to learn more.<p class=message>We'll also visit some cultural landmarks such as the National Gallery of Victoria and the Old Melbourne Gaol.

It's a popular tourist spot.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds interesting. I'm excited to see it.<p class=message>We'll also explore Melbourne's laneways where you'll find some of the best street art and cafes. And of course, we can't forget the iconic Melbourne trams!<p class="message sent">I love trams. They're such an important part of Melbourne's culture.<p class=message>Yes, they certainly are. And speaking of culture, we'll also have a chance to try some of Melbourne's famous coffee and cakes.<p class="message sent">Yum! I'm looking forward to that.<p class=message>Well, let's get started then! Our first stop is the Federation Square, one of Melbourne's most popular landmarks.
