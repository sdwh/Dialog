Ready to dive into this book?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I've been looking forward to going through your manuscript.<p class=message>Great! Well, I hope it's not too much of a mess. I'm still trying to sort out some ideas.<p class="message sent">No problem. That's what I'm here for. So, let's start with the opening chapter. I think there's a bit of confusion with the timeline.<p class=message>Oh right, yeah. Thanks for reminding me. I knew something felt off.<p class="message sent">Don't worry about it. We'll work on the timeline together. And I have to say, I really love the character development in this section.<p class=message>Thank you! That means a lot coming from you. I was worried it was a bit cliche.<p class="message sent">No way! The characters are so relatable and unique. I personally love the quirky best friend.<p class=message>Haha, yeah she's a lot of fun to write. I'm glad you like her.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And I have a feeling readers are going to love this book. It has all the makings of a bestseller.<p class=message>Wow, that's high praise! But I don't want to get too ahead of myself. There's still plenty of work to be done.<p class="message sent">Of course. But hey, it's all part of the process. And I have to say, I'm excited to see where this story goes.<p class=message>Me too. And I couldn't have asked for a better editor to work with. Thanks for your help, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. Let's get to work and make this book the best it can be!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4aa57d04-b8f1-4314-91ff-357ba466eecc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
