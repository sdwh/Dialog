How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Doctor. I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks for asking. So what brings you here today?<p class="message sent">Just a routine checkup. I have to set a good example for our patients!<p class=message>Haha, good point. Let's get started then. How's your blood pressure looking?<p class="message sent">It's a little high, but I blame the coffee I had this morning. Sorry about that.<p class=message>No worries. Just make sure to cut back on caffeine, especially before appointments. How about your cholesterol levels?<p class="message sent">Everything is in the normal range. I've been watching my diet and exercising regularly.<p class=message>That's great to hear. And how's your mental health?<p class="message sent">Oh, I've been feeling a little stressed lately with all the workload, but I'm coping with it.<p class=message>Well, make sure to take some time for yourself and unwind when you can.<p class="message sent">That's good advice, thank you. How about you, Doctor A? How's your health been?<p class=message>I've been doing well, thanks for asking. I've been trying to stay active by running and biking in my free time.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. It's important for us healthcare professionals to take care of ourselves as well.<p class=message>Absolutely. And speaking of caring for ourselves, let's go grab some lunch after this. My treat.<p class="message sent">Aw, thank you! I was actually thinking the same thing. How about we go try that new sushi place down the street?<p class=message>Sounds perfect. Let's finish up here and head out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2b246202-fe01-4ba6-b2c8-61a1ff958fd3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
