I'm so excited to be here. I can't believe we're actually shopping for a ring together.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. It's kind of surreal. But we've got to make sure we choose the perfect one.<p class=message>Definitely! I like this one over here. It's so sparkly and glamorous.<p class="message sent">That is pretty, but I think this one suits you better. It's more elegant and timeless.<p class=message>Hmm, you might be right. Should we also get a necklace to match?<p class="message sent">Sure, let's look around. How about this one? It's subtle but adds a nice touch to any outfit.<p class=message>I love it! And it's so affordable too.<p class="message sent">Indeed. We don't want to go overboard with our spending, especially since we have a lot of other wedding expenses to think about.<p class=message>That's true. But I still want a ring that's unique and special.<p class="message sent">Of course, we want something that reflects our love for each other. How about we have it custom-made?<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can add our initials or a special engraving to make it even more meaningful.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And whenever you wear it, you'll be reminded of our special bond.<p class=message>And the necklace will be a nice complement to the ring. Thank you, B. I'm so glad we did this together.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. And I can't wait to see you wear them on our special day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=df368404-610c-439e-beaf-48fed42c0096.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
