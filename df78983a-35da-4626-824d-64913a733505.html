Plus, I'm trying to watch my figure.<p class=message>I understand, but it won't hurt to treat yourself once in a while. Remember, YOLO!<p class="message sent">Okay, you've convinced me. Let's order a pizza, but only if we can get some veggies on it.<p class=message>Deal! So what toppings should we go for?<p class="message sent">How about mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers?<p class=message>Sounds perfect to me. And while we wait for our pizza, do you want to catch up on some gossip?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Girl talk is always the best, especially over a good pizza.<p class=message>Agreed. So what's new with you lately?<p class="message sent">Well, I finally asked out my crush, and he said yes!<p class=message>That's amazing, congrats! When's your date?<p class="message sent">Next Saturday, we're going to an art exhibit downtown.<p class=message>Ooh, fancy. Don't forget to wear your cutest outfit and take lots of pictures for me to see!<p class="message sent">Haha, I won't. And what about you? Any juicy stories to share?<p class=message>Well, let's just say that my boss is not exactly my favorite person in the world.<p class="message sent">Uh oh, trouble at work?<p class=message>Yeah, but I'm trying to keep a positive attitude and focus on the things that make me happy, like pizza and good company.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. And speaking of good company, here comes our pizza!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=df748bb1-e966-4135-ae20-0ea6398e1c03.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
