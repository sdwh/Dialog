What do you recommend having with Kimchi?<p class=message>Well, it's usually served as a side dish, but I like to have it with rice or as a topping on my noodles.<p class="message sent">That sounds yummy. Do you have a favorite type of Kimchi?<p class=message>Oh, there are so many types! I love the classic Napa cabbage Kimchi, but I've also tried radish and cucumber Kimchi, and they are delicious too!<p class="message sent">Wow, I had no idea there were so many varieties!
