I'm a network engineer and I've been tasked with finding ways to protect the personal data of students and faculty in our school. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Hello A, protecting personal data is crucial these days. One way to do that is to create strong passwords and regularly update them. Two-factor authentication is also a good way to add extra security.<p class=message>That's a good idea, but sometimes people still forget their passwords. What do we do then?<p class="message sent">No problem, we can implement a password reset mechanism that sends a code to your email or mobile phone. That way you can change your password and have it reset.<p class=message>That sounds like a great solution. What about cyber attacks?<p class="message sent">It's important to have a solid security system in place. We can install firewalls, anti-virus software and regularly scan for vulnerabilities.<p class=message>I see. I also heard about phishing attacks. Can you tell me more about that?<p class="message sent">Phishing is a technique where attackers send emails posing as legitimate institutions to lure people into revealing their personal information. It's important to educate people on how to recognize and avoid these scams.<p class=message>I agree. We need to create training programs for our students and faculty to prevent these cyber threats.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And we can also conduct regular security audits to ensure our overall security posture is up-to-date. This will help us proactively identify and address any potential threats.<p class=message>All great ideas B. I'm glad we are on the same page when it comes to protecting our school's data.<p class="message sent">Me too A. Let's work together to create a safer and more secure environment for everyone in our school.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c9873f39-b083-47c4-8bd2-f8fc36143656.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
