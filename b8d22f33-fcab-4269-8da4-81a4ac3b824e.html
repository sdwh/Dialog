We're going to develop a new internal website system for our company.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I heard about that. What technologies are we using for this project?<p class=message>We're going to use Bootstrap for the front-end development, and ASP.NET MVC 5 for the back-end.<p class="message sent">That's great! Bootstrap is very user-friendly and it provides great UI components that will make our website look really sleek.<p class=message>Yes, it's going to really improve the user experience for everyone who uses our website. What part of the back-end are you going to work on?<p class="message sent">I'll probably be working on the database design and API development. What about you?<p class=message>I'm going to be working on the front-end, so I'll get to play around with the cool design templates that Bootstrap provides.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of fun. Have you used the ASP.NET MVC 5 framework before?<p class=message>Yes, I have some experience with it. It's a really robust and scalable framework, which means our website will be able to handle large amounts of traffic.<p class="message sent">Awesome, that's really important for the success of the project. How long do you think it'll take us to develop this website?<p class=message>It's hard to say, but we have a good team and we'll work together to get it done. I'd estimate around 3-4 months.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Let's get started and make this project a huge success!<p class=message>I'm excited to work on this with you. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b8cf6d34-a834-47d8-828b-aca3221cf53b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
