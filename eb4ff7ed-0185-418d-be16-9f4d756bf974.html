My flight was cancelled and I need to know what my options are.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'd be happy to assist you. Can you please provide me with your flight details?<p class=message>Sure thing. It was flight number XY123 from New York to London, scheduled for tomorrow morning.<p class="message sent">Thank you. Let me check that for you. Ah, I see here that the flight has been cancelled due to bad weather conditions. Is there a specific alternative you're looking for?<p class=message>Well, ideally I'd like to get to London as soon as possible. Are there any other flights departing tomorrow that I can be booked on?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do have a few other flights on the same day. Let me just check which ones have available seats for you.<p class=message>That would be great, thank you.<p class="message sent">Alright, we have one departing in the evening and another early morning the following day. Which one would you prefer?<p class=message>I think I'd rather take the morning one, so I can still have most of the day to settle in.<p class="message sent">Sure, that works. I can book you on that flight now. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>No, that's all. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Enjoy your trip to London and feel free to reach out if you need anything else.
