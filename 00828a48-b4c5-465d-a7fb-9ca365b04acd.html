You look like you have something on your mind.<p class="message sent">Hi A, yeah, I'm feeling a bit frustrated. We've had a lot of quality issues lately and I'm not sure how to solve them.<p class=message>I hear ya, B. It can be tough. One thing I've found helpful is to get a fresh perspective. Have you thought about bringing in some outside help or doing a code review?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I think that's a good idea. But where do we find outside help that we can trust?<p class=message>There are some great resources online for code reviews and software testing. We could also reach out to our network and see if anyone has a recommendation.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Another thing I was thinking about was implementing more automated testing. Do you think that would make a difference?<p class=message>Absolutely. Automated testing can save a lot of time and catch issues early on. We could start by looking into some testing frameworks and see what would work best for us.<p class="message sent">Okay, that makes sense. But what about the cost? Won't it be expensive to implement all these new processes?<p class=message>It's true that implementing new processes can sometimes come with a cost. But in this case, I think it's worth it to invest in our software quality. Plus, it's better to catch issues early on rather than having them come up in production, right?<p class="message sent">That's a good point. We don't want to have more headaches down the line. What are some other things we can do to improve our software quality?<p class=message>Well, one thing we could do is make sure our team is up to date on the latest software development practices. We could bring in a trainer or have some internal training sessions.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. I feel like I need a refresher on some of these practices myself.<p class=message>Yeah, me too. It's always good to keep learning and growing. Another thing is to make sure our communication is top notch. We want to avoid miscommunications that could lead to quality issues.<p class="message sent">Yes, absolutely. I think sometimes we assume too much and don't ask enough questions.<p class=message>Exactly. We should always strive to have clear, concise communication. And finally, we should make sure we're testing on as many devices and in as many environments as possible. That way we catch issues before they become problems.<p class="message sent">That's a great point. It can be easy to forget about testing in different environments, but it's so important. Thanks for all your help, A. I feel a lot better about tackling these quality issues.<p class=message>Of course! We're all in this together. Let's make sure our software is the best it can be.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=007cba54-d1d7-4cf0-b406-04df70cc5b17.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
