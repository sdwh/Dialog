As a car enthusiast, I've always found it interesting how some sedans could be turned into video game assets.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more, A. That's why I think it would be cool to design a sedan car model for a computer game.<p class=message>Definitely! But we need to start by establishing a solid database design. What kind of data should we include?<p class="message sent">We could include the car make and model, engine type, transmission type, horsepower, torque, and the number of gears. We could also include the car's top speed, acceleration, braking distance, and weight.<p class=message>That's a great list! How about car dimensions, fuel economy, and 0-60 mph time?<p class="message sent">Of course, we'll need those as well. Also, we should consider adding the car's aerodynamics and suspension setup. That's important for determining its handling and performance.<p class=message>Good point, B. How do you think we should organize all this data? By car make and model, perhaps?<p class="message sent">Yes, that would be a logical way to organize it. We could create separate tables for the different makes and models, and then include the corresponding data fields within each table.<p class=message>I see. What kind of database management system would be best suited for this kind of project?<p class="message sent">A relational database management system like MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server would work seamlessly with our database design.<p class=message>Sounds like we have everything under control. I'm excited to see the finished car model in the game!<p class="message sent">Me too, A! And who knows? Maybe this will inspire us to create more car models for future games.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b7c8516d-ea4e-43da-9cc0-e668890c7f5e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
