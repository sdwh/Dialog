It's a beautiful day to explore Hokkaido, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. I always enjoy driving tourists around this beautiful place.<p class=message>So, how long have you been driving a taxi here in Hokkaido?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's been 10 years now. I know every nook and cranny of Hokkaido like the back of my hand!<p class=message>That's impressive! What's your favourite place here?<p class="message sent">It's hard to pick just one, but I always enjoy taking people to Noboribetsu Onsen. The hot springs there are simply amazing.<p class=message>I've heard about those hot springs! How long does it take to get there from here?<p class="message sent">It'll take us about 2 hours, but the scenery along the way is breathtaking. You'll see what I mean soon enough.<p class=message>That sounds great. I'm really looking forward to it.<p class="message sent">You should try some of the local cuisine too. Have you ever had Jingisukan?<p class=message>Nope, I haven't. What's that?<p class="message sent">It's grilled mutton served with vegetables. It's a popular food in Hokkaido, and it's named after Genghis Khan because it's said to be his favourite food.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. I'll definitely give it a try.<p class="message sent">And if you're feeling adventurous, you could also try out the ice fishing. It's a fun experience, and you get to catch your own fish!<p class=message>Ice fishing? That does sound adventurous. I might just try it out.<p class="message sent">At this rate, you'll have a packed schedule. But don't worry, we'll make sure you have plenty of time to relax as well.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate that. I'm really excited to explore everything Hokkaido has to offer!<p class="message sent">I'm happy to have you here, and I'll do my best to make sure you have a wonderful time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a1aa63b6-e5ef-423b-95e2-46b20a56c58c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
