How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi A. I heard you're a senior software engineer. Can you help me understand Git? I'm having a hard time getting the hang of it.<p class=message>Sure! Git might seem intimidating at first, but trust me, it's easy to use once you get the hang of it. The first step is to install Git on your computer.<p class="message sent">I already did that. What's next?<p class=message>Well, the basic concept of Git is to save changes to a project, so you can go back to previous versions. These saved changes are called "commits". You can make as many commits as you want.<p class="message sent">I see. But how do I make commits?<p class=message>You have to use Git commands on your computer. For example, to make a commit, you'll use the command "git commit". Also, instead of just committing directly to the master branch, it's a good practice to create a new branch first, and then commit to that.<p class="message sent">That sounds like good advice. But, what if I mess up my changes or my commits?<p class=message>That's where Git shines. You can easily revert back to a previous commit or even undo a commit. Plus, there are many resources online to help you if you get stuck.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! That makes a lot more sense now. I'll definitely keep practicing.<p class=message>No problem! Git is a popular tool used by many developers, so it's a good skill to have. Just remember, practice makes perfect!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bbe894b6-63c0-446a-a83c-237953da2fa3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
