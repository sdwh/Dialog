Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, tonight we have a table of guests who have specifically requested our famous cheese fondue. I need you to help me with the service.<p class="message sent">No problem, I'm happy to help. But can you explain how it's made?<p class=message>Of course! We'll start by melting a blend of Swiss cheeses with white wine in a pot over a stove.<p class="message sent">Sounds yummy! Do we add anything else?<p class=message>Yes, we'll season it with garlic, nutmeg and a bit of lemon juice to give it a unique taste. And we'll serve it with bread cubes for dipping.<p class="message sent">That sounds good! Is there anything we should be careful of?<p class=message>Yes, we need to make sure the cheese doesn't get too hot or it will become stringy. Let's keep the flame low and stir it often.<p class="message sent">Got it. Are there any other traditional Swiss dishes we should try?<p class=message>Yes, there's raclette which is another cheese dish served with potatoes, pickles and meats.<p class="message sent">Wow, Swiss cuisine is definitely cheese-based! But I'm definitely excited to try it all.<p class=message>Me too! Let's get started on the fondue then. Do you want to help me grate the cheese?<p class="message sent">Sure, count me in. Let's create a mouth-watering experience for our guests tonight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=943312b8-8bde-4ad0-9d3c-d5cf9dfe8f04.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
