Are you joining us or just here to take some photos?<p class="message sent">Thanks for having me! Just here to capture some moments. You guys seem like pros!<p class=message>Haha, well we've been playing on this beach for years. But anyone can join in, it's all about having fun.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! So what's the plan for the game today?<p class=message>We usually play best out of three sets. Each team has three players on the court, and it's all about serving, passing, setting and spiking!<p class="message sent">Sounds exciting! Mind if I take some snapshots while you guys are playing?<p class=message>Not at all, in fact, we always enjoy having some action shots taken! Feel free to move around and snap some great shots.<p class="message sent">Awesome, thanks! So who's your biggest competition at this beach? Any rival teams?<p class=message>Well, there's a team of locals who come by every now and then. They're pretty good, but we always manage to hold our own against them!<p class="message sent">Got it. Looks like you guys are ready to go, shall I stand at the sidelines and take some pictures?<p class=message>Sounds good to me! Let's get this game started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=131a28a9-b48c-410a-b050-d71e821b7e74.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
