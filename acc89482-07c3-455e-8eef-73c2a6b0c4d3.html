Welcome to our restaurant. How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there. Thank you. I'm pretty hungry, so what do you suggest?<p class=message>Our specialty today is grilled salmon with lemon butter sauce or a succulent beef filet, which is also popular. But if you're feeling adventurous, we also have a spicy shrimp pasta that we highly recommend.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that all sounds really delicious. I'm thinking about the grilled salmon. Does it come with any sides?<p class=message>Yes, sir! You can choose two sides from our selection, which includes roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, Caesar salad, and French fries.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll have the roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes. And what do you recommend for drinks?<p class=message>For something refreshing, I suggest our signature lemonade or our iced tea. We also have a wide selection of wine and beer if you prefer.<p class="message sent">I'll go with the lemonade, please.<p class=message>Sure thing, sir. And do you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions we should be aware of?<p class="message sent">No, I don't have any. Thank you for asking though.<p class=message>Absolutely! Your order will be coming up shortly. In the meantime, can I get you any appetizers or desserts?<p class="message sent">Maybe just a small Caesar salad for starters. And can you tell me about your dessert options?<p class=message>Of course! Our most popular desserts are the chocolate lava cake and the crème brûlée. We also have a freshly baked apple pie and a cheesecake topped with fresh berries.<p class="message sent">Hmm, those all sound amazing too. I think I'll try the crème brûlée.<p class=message>Excellent choice, sir. Your Caesar salad and grilled salmon with roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes and a side of lemon butter sauce are coming right up. Can I assist you with anything else in the meantime?<p class="message sent">No, that's all for now. Thank you so much for your help.<p class=message>My pleasure, sir. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=acc751e4-8217-48a0-bc87-e0fe3ac45164.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
