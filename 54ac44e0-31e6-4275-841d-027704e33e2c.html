I would like to have a cup of Spanish coffee, but can you tell me more about it? I'm not sure what makes it different from other types of coffee.<p class="message sent">Of course! Spanish coffee is made by brewing fresh and strong espresso shots and adding a dollop of whipped cream on top. Do you want me to make you one?<p class=message>Yes, please! But I'm curious, why whipped cream? Does it affect the taste?<p class="message sent">The whipped cream gives a smooth and sweet flavor to the coffee, and it also balances the bitterness of the espresso.<p class=message>Ah, I see. And what about the beans you use? Are they specially roasted?<p class="message sent">Yes, to make authentic Spanish coffee, we use medium to dark roasted beans that are grown in Colombia or Brazil.<p class=message>That's interesting to know. Can you show me how to make one?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! First, I pull two shots of espresso and pour them into a cup. Then, I scoop a generous amount of whipped cream and put it on top of the espresso. Finally, I sprinkle some cocoa powder over the cream.<p class=message>It looks amazing! Can I take a picture of it?<p class="message sent">Of course, go ahead!<p class=message>Mmm, this is delicious! The cream makes it taste so much richer than regular coffee.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it! Spanish coffee is definitely one of my favorites.<p class=message>I can see why! I want to learn more about coffee now.<p class="message sent">Well, you've come to the right place! I also roast the coffee beans used in the cafe, so if you're interested, I can show you the roasting process.<p class=message>Absolutely! I would love to learn about that too.<p class="message sent">Great, let's go to the roasting room after you finish your coffee.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=54aa0dfe-e3b5-4c51-aff8-102b0b755710.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
