It's always exciting to learn about new updates.<p class=message>Definitely. By the way, do you have any idea on how to purchase SQL Server licenses?<p class="message sent">Well, there are different types of licenses depending on how many users and devices you have.<p class=message>That's right. I'm thinking of getting the Enterprise Edition for our company. We have a lot of users after all.<p class="message sent">That's a good choice. It comes with a lot of useful features.<p class=message>But it's quite expensive. Do you have any tips on how to save some money?<p class="message sent">Actually, one way to save money is to purchase licenses through a Volume Licensing Program.<p class=message>Hmm, I see. Can you explain more about that?<p class="message sent">Sure. Basically, it's a program that offers discounts for customers who purchase licenses in bulk.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I'll definitely consider that. Thanks for the advice, B.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. It's always good to help out a fellow colleague.<p class=message>Speaking of which, do you need any assistance with your database management?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm struggling with optimizing some queries. Do you have any experience with that?<p class=message>Of course. Let me take a look at your code and see if I can help you out.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. I appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem. We're a team, after all. We all need to help each other out.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I'm glad to have you as a teammate.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8a5d20a6-5ec9-4243-b273-7199abc6bf94.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
