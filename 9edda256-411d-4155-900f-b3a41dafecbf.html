Have you been busy tonight, B?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's been pretty steady. Lots of people craving seafood, I suppose.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Our hard work is paying off. Speaking of seafood, what do you think is our best dish?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely the grilled octopus. It's always a crowd-pleaser. And the presentation is fantastic.<p class=message>Ah, yes! It's one of my favorites, too. It's good to know we're on the same page.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. How's your week been, A?<p class=message>Busy as usual. But nothing too stressful, thank goodness. How about yours?<p class="message sent">It was pretty good. I went to a beach on my day off and spent a lot of time in the sun.<p class=message>Sounds amazing! Did you get a chance to try any seafood while you were there?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. I had some fresh grilled clams, they were delicious.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'll have to try and visit that beach soon.<p class="message sent">You should! Itâ€™s a really nice spot. So, any plans for the weekend?<p class=message>Actually, I'm thinking of taking my kids to the aquarium. They love sea creatures, and it might give us some inspiration for new dishes.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great plan. Kids always enjoy learning about marine life.<p class=message>Yes, it should be a fun time. And speaking of new dishes, do you have any ideas for specials this week?<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking of trying a new scallop ceviche. It would be a nice refreshing appetizer for summer.<p class=message>Perfect. Let's give it a try and see how it goes over with our customers.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I'll start preparing it tonight.<p class=message>Great, I'm excited to try it. Keep up the good work, B!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. You too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9ece63a6-693e-4613-abf8-2ec9969a5f2a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
