I'm looking for a way to store and transfer my files easily. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do! Have you considered using a USB flash drive? It's a compact and convenient solution that's perfect for your needs.<p class=message>That sounds great! How does it work?<p class="message sent">It's simple really. You just plug it into any computer or device with a USB port and you can access your files right away. Plus, it's fast and reliable.<p class=message>That's amazing. How much data can a USB flash drive hold?<p class="message sent">Well, it depends on the size you choose. We have options ranging from 16GB to 256GB for you to choose from.<p class=message>Wow, that's a lot of storage! Which brand do you recommend?<p class="message sent">We have a wide selection of brands, but I personally recommend SanDisk. They are known for their high-quality and durable flash drives.<p class=message>That sounds good. Are the flash drives compatible with both Mac and PC?<p class="message sent">Yes, they are compatible with both operating systems. So, it doesn't matter which one you use.<p class=message>That's great to hear. How much does a USB flash drive usually cost?<p class="message sent">Again, it depends on the size and brand. But, our prices start at around $10, which is very affordable.<p class=message>That's definitely within my budget. Thanks for your help, I'll take a SanDisk 64GB flash drive.<p class="message sent">Great choice! Would you like me to show you some cases to protect your flash drive as well?<p class=message>Yes, please. I want to make sure my flash drive stays safe and secure.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Let's take a look at some options.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99393646-fc86-486c-bbd2-7cc494b8c1be.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
