How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about yourself?<p class=message>Couldn't be better. We're getting quite a bit of business today! I think it's because of the fresh seafood we just got in.<p class="message sent">Oh definitely. The customers have been raving about it. How do you recommend they try it?<p class=message>Well, our specialty is the grilled octopus. It's delicious and tender with just the right amount of seasoning.<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing. I think I'll have to try that for myself on my break.<p class=message>You definitely should! Speaking of breaks, how's school going for you?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thanks. Just trying to balance work and studies.<p class=message>I know how that can be. I remember working and going to school at the same time. It's not easy, but it's worth it in the end.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And working here has given me some great experience in the restaurant industry.<p class=message>Glad to hear it. We've got a great team here, and we all learn from each other.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. By the way, do you have any recommendations for the customers who want to try something a little more exotic?<p class=message>Yes! Our sashimi platter is fantastic. We have a selection of different fish that are flown in fresh from Japan.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds really impressive. I'll definitely recommend it to our customers.<p class=message>Great! And if you need help with anything, just let me know. We're all here to support each other.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate it. It's really nice working with such a positive and helpful team.<p class=message>You're welcome. We're happy to have you. So, ready to get back to work and serve some more amazing seafood?<p class="message sent">Definitely! Let's do this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=12326bcc-45b2-41bb-82e9-5a8275ce5471.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
