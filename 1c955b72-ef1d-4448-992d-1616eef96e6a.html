How's the dough rising today?"<p class="message sent">"It's rising well, Chef! Our croissants are going to be top-notch today."<p class=message>"Glad to hear it. I'm whipping up a batch of baguettes myself. Gotta keep up with the French bread demand, you know."<p class="message sent">"Speaking of French bread, have you tried out that new recipe for pain de campagne? The customers are loving it."<p class=message>"Oh, I haven't had the chance yet. You'll have to give me a taste."<p class="message sent">"Absolutely. And by the way, have you ever tried adding bacon to your sourdough? It's a game-changer."<p class=message>"Bacon in bread? Now that's something I've got to try. We should do a collaboration with our bacon and bread skills."<p class="message sent">"I'm down for that. And what about some eclairs? Our pastry case is running a bit low."<p class=message>"Eclairs it is. I'll get started on the filling, you take care of the choux pastry."<p class="message sent">"Sounds like a plan, Chef. By the way, have you heard about that bread festival in Paris next month? We should definitely check it out."<p class=message>"Yes! I've got it marked on my calendar. I can't wait to try some of the best breads in France."<p class="message sent">"And of course, we'll have to bring back some new ideas to try out in our bakery."<p class=message>"Agreed. Who knows, we might come back with a new signature bread."<p class="message sent">"The possibilities are endless. Speaking of which, I should check on those croissants. Don't want them to overproof."<p class=message>"Good catch! And I'll get the baguettes in the oven. We're going to have some happy customers today."</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1c8d1508-323e-42eb-93a7-e291dd68264d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
