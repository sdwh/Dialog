How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing fine, thank you. Just a little nervous, as you might imagine.<p class=message>Don't worry, there's nothing to be afraid of. We just have a few questions to ask you about the robbery at the bank.<p class="message sent">I understand. But I have to tell you, I didn't do it. I was at home all day.<p class=message>That's what they all say. But we have some pretty damning evidence against you. Care to explain this photo of you inside the bank?<p class="message sent">Oh, that photo. Well, you see, I was just there to open a new account.<p class=message>Really? And what about this video of you holding a bag with money spilling out of it?<p class="message sent">Um, that's...well, you see...I found that bag on the street and was taking it to the police station.<p class=message>Come on, Mr. B. Do you really expect us to believe that?<p class="message sent">Okay, okay. I'll level with you. I did do it. But can you blame me? Times are tough and I needed the money.<p class=message>That's no excuse for breaking the law, Mr. B. But I appreciate your honesty. We'll have to take you in now, but at least you'll have a chance to make things right.<p class="message sent">I understand, officer. And I'm ready to face the consequences of my actions.<p class=message>That's the right attitude to have. Now, let's get you processed and start the paperwork.<p class="message sent">One question before we start, officer. Could I request a cup of coffee? I heard the coffee here is the best.<p class=message>(laughing) Sure thing, Mr. B. I'll see what I can do.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1037aa4b-5ae3-48af-901c-927aa248bbf1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
