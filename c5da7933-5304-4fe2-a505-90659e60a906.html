How about you?<p class=message>Pretty busy actually, just finishing up our ISO 27001 audit report.<p class="message sent">Ah yes, the joys of report writing. What did you think of this year's audit?<p class=message>It was pretty routine, nothing too unexpected. Although, one company did have a ping pong table in their break room, which was a nice surprise.<p class="message sent">Well, that definitely adds to the atmosphere! Did you test their information security policies while playing ping pong too?<p class=message>Haha, no, but I made a mental note to suggest some security protocols around the ping pong table.<p class="message sent">That's what we like to hear. Always on the lookout for vulnerabilities, even during recreational activities.<p class=message>Absolutely! We have to make sure these companies are protected from ALL angles.<p class="message sent">Speaking of angles, have you heard about the company with the pet-friendly policy? I audited them last month and was pleasantly surprised by the number of dogs in the office.<p class=message>No way! That sounds so fun. Did you interview the dogs for compliance with infosec regulations?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, dogs are not great at answering audit-related questions. But, I made sure to suggest some dog training on cybersecurity best practices to the HR department.<p class=message>Wow, we really are some helpful auditors, aren't we?<p class="message sent">Hey, information security is serious business, but that doesn't mean we can't have some fun along the way.<p class=message>Agreed! Alright, I better get back to finishing this report. Catch you later!<p class="message sent">Good luck! Don't forget to take some ping pong breaks.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5d8f284-38b5-4329-b431-7b6c5e8c0b3c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
