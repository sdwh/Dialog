How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks! So, let's get started with the audit. Have you prepared all the necessary documents?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have everything ready for you. But, I must warn you, it's not as exciting as the last time.<p class=message>(Laughs) That's alright. I bet we can make it interesting. So, what's new with your business?<p class="message sent">We've had some exciting growth this year, but with growth comes new financial challenges.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. With more success, of course comes more responsibility. But, don't worry, that's where we come in. So, let's get to work!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. (Pause) Hey, have you heard about the new coffee shop that just opened down the street?<p class=message>(Surprised) No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's great! They have the best cappuccino I've ever tasted.<p class=message>Wow, I'll have to check it out sometime. (Pause) Alright, let's refocus here. I noticed some discrepancies in these numbers. Can you explain these to me?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes. That was a mistake from our end. We have already fixed it and updated the numbers accordingly.<p class=message>Great, thanks for letting me know. Overall, I'm satisfied with the report. It looks like your business is doing well.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. We're grateful for all the hard work you put in to help us. We couldn't have done it without you.<p class=message>It's my pleasure! (Pauses) Actually, do you still have that coupon for that coffee shop?<p class="message sent">(Laughs) Sure, I can get it for you once we're done here.<p class=message>(Smiling) Thanks, B. Always a pleasure doing business with you.<p class="message sent">Same here, A.
