The seats are comfortable and they offer a lot of entertainment options.<p class=message>That’s good to know. Did you happen to try any of the food on the last flight?<p class="message sent">I did. The food was surprisingly good for airline food.<p class=message>Wow, that’s impressive. Did you also check out the bathrooms?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. They were pretty clean and well-stocked.<p class=message>That’s always a plus. Do they offer any special services for long-haul flights?<p class="message sent">Yes, they actually offer a sleep kit with a pillow, blanket, and earplugs.<p class=message>Nice, I always have trouble sleeping on flights. Has the airline ever lost your luggage?<p class="message sent">No, I haven’t had that problem yet. Knock on wood!<p class=message>Yeah, that’s definitely something to be thankful for. Have you ever had a delay with this airline?<p class="message sent">I have, but they handled it pretty well. They provided updates and vouchers for food and drinks during the delay.<p class=message>That’s great to hear. Overall, it seems like a good airline to fly with.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I’ve had good experiences with them and would recommend them.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=65b50cc8-766f-4732-a3d2-d6fe350959e1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
