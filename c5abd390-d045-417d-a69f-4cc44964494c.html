My little one has been having a runny nose and a slight fever. I was wondering if you could recommend some medication suitable for her?<p class=message>Of course! Before I recommend anything, may I ask how old your baby is?<p class="message sent">She's six months old.<p class=message>Alright, for a baby that young, it's important to use medications that are specifically tailored for infants. We have a few options that are safe for babies under a year old.<p class="message sent">That sounds good. Are there any specific ingredients I should avoid?<p class=message>Your baby's age is sensitive to medication ingredients, so I recommend avoiding any that contain aspirin or ibuprofen. Acetaminophen is a common ingredient in infant medication, so we do carry some options that contain it.<p class="message sent">Okay, thank you for letting me know. What about medication for nasal congestion?<p class=message>Saline drops are a great option for infants. It's a natural and safe way to help loosen mucus and make it easier for your baby to breathe. We also have a few vapor rubs for infants that can help relieve congestion.<p class="message sent">That's good to know, especially since I want to avoid medication with harsh chemicals. Thank you so much for your help!<p class=message>You're welcome. Always feel free to consult with your pediatrician or consult with me if you have any further questions or concerns. Is there anything else you need today?<p class="message sent">No, that's all. Thank you for your assistance.<p class=message>No problem, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5a54891-f04b-48a3-b6fd-f167db154eb0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
