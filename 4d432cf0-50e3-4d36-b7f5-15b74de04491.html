I heard your chicken rice is the best in the food court.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! But your soybean milk smells amazing too.<p class=message>Thank you! Have you tried our breakfast set with half boiled eggs?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Do you serve them with kaya toast?<p class=message>Yes, we do. Would you like to try one?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll take one. And can I have some chicken rice to go with it?<p class=message>Of course! What a perfect combination. Let me pack that for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you. Your chicken rice looks fantastic. How do you cook it?<p class=message>We use only the best quality chicken and cook it in a secret blend of herbs and spices. And the rice is cooked with chicken broth.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious. And your soybean milk is homemade?<p class=message>Yes, we make fresh soybean milk every morning. It's a traditional recipe passed down for generations.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. I love how authentic both of our dishes are.<p class=message>Yes, it's great to work together and provide customers with a taste of real Singaporean breakfast.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We should have a joint promotion and offer a discount for customers who buy both our dishes.<p class=message>That's a fantastic idea! Let's talk to the management and make it happen.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class=message>No problem. Let me know when you want to start the promotion.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks for the great conversation.<p class=message>Anytime, my friend. Enjoy your breakfast!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4d3f37e0-99b7-4ebc-8f6f-b80852f2d19c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
