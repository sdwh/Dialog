How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">Pretty good, thanks for asking, A. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. So, we're here to perform the ISO 27001 audit, right?<p class="message sent">Yep, that's right. I hope you brought your magnifying glass and Sherlock Holmes hat.<p class=message>Haha, I did indeed. Gotta make sure we leave no stone unturned, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, where do we start?<p class=message>Well, let's start with database security. Are all the databases properly secured?<p class="message sent">Of course! We even have a fire-breathing dragon guarding them.<p class=message>Wait, what? I think I missed that part in the documentation.<p class="message sent">Just kidding, A. But seriously, we have the most up-to-date security measures in place.<p class=message>Good to hear. Now let's move on to physical security. Is access to the server room restricted?<p class="message sent">Yes, only authorized personnel can enter. And we also installed a fingerprint scanner for extra security.<p class=message>Nice! That will surely keep any unwanted intruders out.<p class="message sent">You got that right. Ok, let's move on to the disaster recovery plan. Have you reviewed it recently?<p class=message>Yes, we reviewed it just last month. We made some updates to ensure it meets ISO 27001 requirements.<p class="message sent">Great. And what about the backup procedures? Are they adequate?<p class=message>Yes, we have multiple backups stored in different locations, just in case.<p class="message sent">That's awesome! It's always better to be safe than sorry.<p class=message>Agreed. Well, I think we covered everything on our checklist. It was a pleasure working with you, B.<p class="message sent">Same here, A. And if you ever need help deciphering dragon-speak, you know who to call.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=27e084db-1eed-40af-a500-9e3e7aa131f3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
