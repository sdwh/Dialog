Why do you ask?<p class=message>I just wanted to catch up on some of the security objectives. They seem pretty important.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's all about keeping personal information safe and secure.<p class=message>Right! And I know that one of the objectives is to protect against unauthorized access.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's true. You want to make sure that only the right people have access to private information.<p class=message>And what about the objective to ensure information is accurate and complete?<p class="message sent">That's about making sure everyone follows the same guidelines and that information is always up to date.<p class=message>Got it. What about protection against external threats?<p class="message sent">You want to have measures in place to protect against things like hacking and cyberattacks.<p class=message>That makes sense. How do you make sure you meet all the objectives?<p class="message sent">You need to do regular risk assessments and make sure you have the right policies and procedures in place.<p class=message>I see. So, what are some of the challenges youâ€™ve faced while implementing ISO 27001?<p class="message sent">One of the biggest challenges is getting everyone in the organization on board and following the same standards.<p class=message>Ah, I can imagine that could be tough. Have you had to train people on it?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we had a whole training program set up to get everyone up to speed.<p class=message>That's great. It seems like a lot of work, but definitely worth it in the end.<p class="message sent">Definitely! It gives everyone peace of mind knowing their information is safe and secure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9f4eb4ee-7c96-42fd-bfc3-507aeaeb7af3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
