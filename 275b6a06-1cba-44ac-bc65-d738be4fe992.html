Welcome to our French restaurant. Have you eaten with us before?<p class="message sent">Bonsoir! Yes, I've been working in the kitchen for several months and the food here is amazing. What can I get started for you?<p class=message>We were hoping for five courses, starting with something light and refreshing. Any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Of course! How about our classic French onion soup to start? It's always a crowd-pleaser.<p class=message>That sounds great. And for the main course?<p class="message sent">Our lamb chops with herb-roasted potatoes and grilled asparagus never disappoints.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds delightful. And a red wine to go with it?<p class="message sent">I would suggest a Bordeaux. It pairs perfectly with the richness of the lamb.<p class=message>Perfect. And for dessert?<p class="message sent">Our crème brûlée is a popular choice, but we also have a chocolate mousse that is divine.<p class=message>Tough decision! We'll have to try both.<p class="message sent">Why not? You can't go wrong with a little indulgence.<p class=message>Absolutely. This is our first time dining out in quite a while, and we're excited to try something new.<p class="message sent">Well, you came to the right place. We pride ourselves on using fresh, authentic ingredients to create traditional French dishes.<p class=message>It certainly shows. The ambiance and presentation are spot on.<p class="message sent">Thank you. We strive for perfection in every aspect of the dining experience.<p class=message>Well, we appreciate your efforts. This has been a lovely evening, and we can't wait to come back.<p class="message sent">Merci beaucoup! We look forward to serving you again soon. Bonne nuit!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2756de91-3456-4c95-9010-bca7cf78e8fb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
