Are you excited to see the Statue of Liberty up close?<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely! It's been on my bucket list for years.<p class=message>Great! Let's head over there and snap a photo in front of the Statue. It's a picture-perfect moment.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect to me! Do people usually pose in front of the statue?<p class=message>Of course, they do! You can strike a silly pose or a serious one, it's totally up to you.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I want to do a jumping photo. What do you think?<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can position the camera to make it look like you're jumping over the Statue.<p class="message sent">Awesome! Do you have any tips on how to make the jump look good in the photo?<p class=message>Sure thing, just jump as high as you can and make sure to land on the same spot. I'll help you with the timing.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. Let's do this!<p class=message>Okay, on the count of three, jump! One, two, three!<p class=message>That was awesome! Let's take a look at the photo.<p class="message sent">Wow, it turned out better than I expected! Thanks for all your help.<p class=message>No problem, glad I could assist. Do you want to explore the rest of the island, or are you good for now?<p class="message sent">I think I'll head back to the mainland for now. But thanks for the amazing experience!<p class=message>You're welcome, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a6df7057-c106-4659-a9b1-551e36810375.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
