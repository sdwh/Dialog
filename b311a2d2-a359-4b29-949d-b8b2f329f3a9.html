How about yours?<p class=message>It was pretty good. I was finally able to binge-watch my favorite TV show.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a perfect weekend. Did you get any work done, though?<p class=message>(laughs) Not a lot, but I did manage to catch up on some emails.<p class="message sent">Speaking of emails, we have a lot to cover in today's meeting. Are you ready?<p class=message>Yes, I am. Let's get started.<p class="message sent">Great. First on the agenda is the upcoming company picnic. Have you decided what game you want to play this year?<p class=message>I was thinking of a tug-of-war competition. How does that sound?<p class="message sent">(smiling) That sounds like a fun idea. I’ll make sure to add that to the list.<p class=message>(smiling) Great, and we could also have a BBQ cook-off competition. What do you think?<p class="message sent">(nodding) I like that idea. Everyone loves a good cook-off competition, and it's a perfect way to bring everyone together.<p class=message>(smiling) I agree. Let's make it happen.<p class="message sent">Next on the agenda is the new office layout. Have you heard back from the interior designer?<p class=message>(nodding) Yes, they sent over some initial designs, and I think we’re on the right track.<p class="message sent">(smiling) That's good news. I can't wait to see the final product.<p class=message>(smiling) Me too. Thanks for all of your help, B.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Of course, A. That's what I'm here for.<p class=message>(laughs) I couldn't do it without you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b310bfaf-aaa6-42d3-af7c-248dd3c3ac2b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
