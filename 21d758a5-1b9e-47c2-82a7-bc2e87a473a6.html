Thank you for meeting me today to discuss the curriculum design.<p class="message sent">Of course, A! I'm excited to brainstorm ideas with you.<p class=message>So, I wanted to talk to you about the materials we will be using for the course.<p class="message sent">What do you have in mind?<p class=message>I was thinking about incorporating some fun and interactive videos and podcasts to engage the students.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea! But we also need to make sure the materials are educational and beneficial for the students.<p class=message>Definitely. I was thinking about finding some materials related to current events and pop culture that the students might find interesting.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. We want to make sure the content is relevant and relatable to their lives.<p class=message>Exactly. And we can also add in some vocabulary and grammar exercises based on the materials to reinforce their learning.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's important to have a balance between enjoyable and challenging materials.<p class=message>Yes, and we can even have some group projects where the students create their own videos or podcasts using the language they've learned.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a fun idea! I'm sure the students would love that.<p class=message>I'm glad you think so! I want to create a positive and engaging learning environment for the students.<p class="message sent">That's our goal as teachers, after all. This course sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun for everyone involved.<p class=message>I hope so! Thank you for your input, B. Let's make this curriculum the best it can be.<p class="message sent">I'm looking forward to it, A. Let's get started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=21d1839b-e681-4d34-844f-362e2692ff55.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
