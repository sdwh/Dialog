We could also try to incorporate some customer feedback into our testing process.<p class="message sent">That's a good point, speaking of customers, have you seen our recent feedback surveys?<p class=message>No, I haven't, what do they say?<p class="message sent">It looks like a lot of customers have been having trouble with our software crashing unexpectedly.<p class=message>Yikes, we definitely need to address that. Maybe we could prioritize that issue and focus on fixing it first.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And hey, on a lighter note, have you seen the latest funny memes making their rounds in the tech world?<p class=message>Haha no, show me!<p class="message sent">(pulls up a meme on their phone) Check this one out. "The only QA engineer in the room is the coffee machine."<p class=message>(laughs) Oh my gosh, that's too real.<p class="message sent">Gotta keep things light sometimes, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. Alright, let's get back to work and start tackling these quality issues.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=81bc72ec-947f-44a4-a7ba-a5a93c21352f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
