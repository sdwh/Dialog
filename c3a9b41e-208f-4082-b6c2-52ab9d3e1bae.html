How are you doing?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks. What brings you here?<p class=message>Well, as a network engineer, I'm always concerned about network security. I was hoping to get your input on how we can better protect our network against online attacks.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! As a cybersecurity specialist, I'm always looking for ways to fortify systems against threats.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Maybe you can tell me about some common tactics that you've seen hackers use?<p class="message sent">Well, one common tactic is phishing emails. Hackers will send emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, but they contain links that direct users to fake websites that steal their login credentials. It's important to educate our employees about these types of scams.<p class=message>Yeah, I agree. Another tactic I've seen is a Distributed Denial of Service attack, which floods our network with traffic until it crashes. What can we do to prevent that?<p class="message sent">One thing we can do is implement firewalls and intrusion detection software. We can also limit the amount of traffic coming into our network from outside sources.<p class=message>Makes sense. How about malware, have you seen that used often?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Malware is a big problem because it can give hackers remote access to our systems. It's important that we keep our antivirus software updated and that we scan our systems regularly.<p class=message>Great advice, thanks. Any final thoughts?<p class="message sent">Just remember that it's important to stay vigilant and to always be looking for ways to improve our security protocols.<p class=message>Thanks for your help, I feel more confident that our network will be safe against online threats.<p class="message sent">Glad I could assist. Let's continue to work together to keep our network secure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c3a792be-29b4-461d-9ce9-4951d7f6b11e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
