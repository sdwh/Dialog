Are you ready to talk about our project?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I’m doing great. I’ve got all my nerdy gear on, I’m ready to go!<p class=message>(laughs) Okay, let’s get down to business. So, we’re developing a smart home system. What’s your plan?<p class="message sent">My plan is to create a network of interconnected devices, which will communicate with each other and can be controlled by a central hub.<p class=message>That sounds pretty cool. And how about the software side of things?<p class="message sent">We want our software to be user-friendly and customizable. The users should be able to set up their own routines and schedules.<p class=message>Yeah, and we also want to make it easy for developers to add new features and integrate existing smart home devices.<p class="message sent">Exactly. It’s all about making life easier and more convenient for our users.<p class=message>Totally. I can already imagine sitting on my couch and just saying “lights off” and all the lights in my apartment turning off.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, that’s just one of the many possibilities. We could also have the system automatically adjust the temperature or turn on the coffee maker in the morning.<p class=message>Ooh, I like the coffee idea. Maybe we could even have it brew the coffee at the perfect temperature and strength, just the way the user likes it.<p class="message sent">Yes, that’s definitely possible. With this system, the sky's the limit.<p class=message>(laughs) Who knows, maybe we’ll even be able to develop a robot maid in the future.<p class="message sent">Hey, don't get too excited. Let's make sure our smart home system works perfectly first.<p class=message>You're right. But I can dream, can't I? (both laugh)<p class="message sent">Of course you can. But for now, let's focus on developing the best smart home system out there.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=67327e3b-ab15-46f1-9294-b1d675d4f8cc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
