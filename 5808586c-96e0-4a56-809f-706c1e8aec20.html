How's your day going, Engineer B?<p class="message sent">Hey, Engineer A! I'm good, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well too. So, what are we working on with Node.js today?<p class="message sent">We're building a new API for an e-commerce site, integrating payment gateway with Stripe.<p class=message>Ah, sounds exciting! Have you worked with Stripe before?<p class="message sent">Indeed. I've integrated it with a few projects in the past. It's quite simple to use and reliable.<p class=message>That's good to know. I'm looking forward to learning from you. Any tips you could share?<p class="message sent">Sure! One tip is to make sure to read through the documentation carefully, especially for the features you'll be using.<p class=message>Got it. I'll make sure to do that. By the way, have you heard about the new Node.js features that will be released soon?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. Node 16 will include improved ES modules support, better debugging, and V8 engine updates, amongst others.<p class=message>Nice. We should definitely check out those upgrades once they're available.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Speaking of upgrades, have you had your coffee yet? I think I could use a quick break.<p class=message>Ha! I was just thinking the same.
