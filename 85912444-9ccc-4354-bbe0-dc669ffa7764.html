What can I get for you?<p class="message sent">Hi, just a black coffee for me please. Thanks.<p class=message>Sure thing. So, let's get started. Can you tell me a little bit about your background?<p class="message sent">Well, I grew up in a small town and always had a passion for technology. After getting my degree in computer engineering, I began working for a software company and eventually started my own company.<p class=message>That's impressive. What kind of software does your company specialize in?<p class="message sent">We focus on developing mobile apps for various industries, from healthcare to finance.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. What's been your biggest challenge as a business owner?<p class="message sent">I would say balancing work and personal life. It can be tough, but I make sure to take breaks and spend time with my family whenever I can.<p class=message>That's a great mentality to have. Speaking of breaks, do you have any hobbies or interests outside of work?<p class="message sent">I love to travel and try new foods. I've been fortunate enough to visit some incredible places and explore different cultures.<p class=message>That's amazing. Have you tried any noteworthy dishes or cuisines recently?<p class="message sent">Actually, I recently tried a Korean dessert called bingsu. It's basically shaved ice with various toppings like fruit and condensed milk. It was delicious!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. I'll have to try it sometime. Well, thank you so much for your time and insights. I appreciate it.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Thanks for having me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=85909f8d-36e0-4f74-aaff-657db9fe91a9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
