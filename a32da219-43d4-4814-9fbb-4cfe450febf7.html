I'm excited to discuss our upcoming fish sandwich menu for our new fast food joint.<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Yes, I've been experimenting with different fish types and batter recipes.<p class=message>Awesome, so what have you come up with so far?<p class="message sent">Well, I think using cod fish with a crispy panko breadcrumb coating would be delicious. And serving it on a brioche bun with tartar sauce and lettuce would hit the spot.<p class=message>Sounds tasty! But what about those who might not want a breaded fish sandwich? Maybe we can offer a grilled option too?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We could marinate the fish in lemon juice and herbs and grill it to perfection. Then serve it on a whole wheat bun with avocado and tomato.<p class=message>Yum, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. And what sides could we offer to go with the fish sandwiches?<p class="message sent">How about some classic french fries or sweet potato fries? And we could also do a coleslaw or a side salad for those who prefer something lighter.<p class=message>Great ideas! And speaking of lighter options, do you think we should offer a fish taco or wrap option as well?<p class="message sent">Definitely! We could use the grilled fish and serve it with a tangy salsa and a soft tortilla or wrap. It would be a perfect alternative for customers who are looking for something more refreshing.<p class=message>Perfect, so it looks like we've got a solid plan for our fish sandwich options. Thanks for your help, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. I always love a good challenge in the kitchen. Let's get to work and make some amazing fish sandwiches!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a32c76f4-85a8-467e-8b34-dfaecb4cfd2a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
