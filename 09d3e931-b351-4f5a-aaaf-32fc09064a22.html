No, what is that?<p class="message received message-content">Oh, it's a Vietnamese sandwich filled with different things like meat, vegetables, and spices. It's really tasty!<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, that sounds interesting. Where can I try it?<p class="message received message-content">There's a Vietnamese restaurant near my place that sells the best Banh Mi.<p class="message sent message-content">Great! What fillings would you recommend?<p class="message received message-content">My favorite is the traditional one with roasted pork, pickled carrots, cucumbers, cilantro, and a spicy sauce. But they also have vegetarian options with tofu and mushrooms.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds delicious! Do you know how to make it at home?<p class="message received message-content">Actually, I've tried to make it before but it didn't turn out as good as the one in the restaurant.<p class="message sent message-content">Maybe we should have a Banh Mi-making party and compete for the best one.<p class="message received message-content">That's a fun idea! Let's do it.<p class="message sent message-content">But we need to find a good recipe and ingredients first.<p class="message received message-content">Don't worry, I have a friend who's Vietnamese and she can give us some tips.<p class="message sent message-content">Perfect! I can't wait to taste your failed attempt at Banh Mi.<p class="message received message-content">Hey, it wasn't that bad! But I'm sure we'll do much better next time.<p class="message sent message-content">I believe you. It's not the end of the world if we fail, we'll just end up ordering from the restaurant again.<p class="message received message-content">And trying their other dishes too! Have you had their pho?<p class="message sent message-content">Nope, but I'm down to try it. Vietnamese food seems to be a hidden gem.<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely! It's worth exploring and expanding our taste buds.<p class="message sent message-content">Thanks for introducing me to Banh Mi. I can't wait to try it out and have our Banh Mi-making party.<p class="message received message-content">My pleasure! It's always fun to discover new foods together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=09c9883d-50e4-475d-b204-2f584aea5af4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
