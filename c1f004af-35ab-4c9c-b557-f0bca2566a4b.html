I just got back from a trip to Japan.<p class=message>No way! I’ve always wanted to go there. Where did you visit?<p class="message sent">My favourite place was Kyoto. The cherry blossom season was just wrapping up and it was incredible.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. What did you do there?<p class="message sent">I visited a lot of temples and shrines, but my favourite was Fushimi Inari Shrine. It was so peaceful and had the most beautiful torii gates.<p class=message>I’ve heard about that shrine. Did you try any Japanese food?<p class="message sent">Yes, I ate so many different things! One of the most interesting things I had was octopus balls, which are called takoyaki.<p class=message>That sounds… interesting. What else did you see?<p class="message sent">I also went to Osaka and Tokyo. In Tokyo, I visited the famous Robot Restaurant, which was a really unique experience.<p class=message>I’ve heard mixed reviews about that place. Was it worth it?<p class="message sent">It was definitely a tourist trap, but it was so entertaining that I don't regret going.<p class=message>So where are you planning to go next?<p class="message sent">I’m thinking about heading to Europe! Any suggestions?<p class=message>Well, if you love food, you have to go to Italy. The pizza and pasta are incredible.<p class="message sent">Oh, I already love Italian food. That’s definitely on my list.<p class=message>And if you’re into history, Prague is an amazing city to visit. The architecture is stunning.<p class="message sent">That sounds really interesting. I’ll have to do some research on Prague.<p class=message>Absolutely! Let me know if you need any more recommendations.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I definitely will!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c1edc8b5-b283-47bd-ad7a-9ddcec5f98be.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
