I'm the F&B Manager for the hotel here. Nice to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Hi, A! Pleasure to meet you too. Thanks for inviting me to try your new cocktails.<p class=message>Of course! We always love to collaborate with local bartenders. So, shall we start the tasting?<p class="message sent">Definitely! What do you recommend starting with?<p class=message>How about our newest creation, the "Seoul-Mate"? It's a mix of soju, peach liqueur, lemon juice and soda water.<p class="message sent">Sounds refreshing! Let me give it a try. *takes a sip* Wow, that's surprisingly delicious.<p class=message>I'm glad you like it. What do you think of the balance? Is there anything you would tweak?<p class="message sent">Honestly, it's perfect as is. The sweetness from the peach liqueur compliments the acidity of the lemon juice really well.<p class=message>Excellent! Now, let's move on to the next one. This one's called "Jeju Sunrise". It's made with Jeju orange-infused gin, Aperol, honey syrup, and orange bitters.<p class="message sent">Ooh, I'm excited for this one. *takes a sip* Mmm, the orange flavor really shines through. And the bitterness of Aperol gives it a nice complexity.<p class=message>That's exactly what we were going for! Our goal was to make a cocktail that captured the essence of Jeju Island's citrus fruit.<p class="message sent">You definitely succeeded. This would be perfect for a sunny day at the beach in Jeju.<p class=message>That's what we were thinking when we named it. Okay, last one. It's a twist on a classic gin fizz. We call it the "Busan Fizz"<p class="message sent">I'm always down for a good gin fizz. Let's see how your twist compares. *takes a sip* Wow, that's really unique.<p class=message>We added a touch of gochujang to give it a subtle kick at the end. It's meant to be a nod to the spicy food culture of Busan.<p class="message sent">That's really clever. The heat is definitely there but it doesn't overpower the other flavors.<p class=message>You're a natural at this, B! I'm glad we could collaborate on this tasting. I think we have a real winner with these three new cocktails.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's been a pleasure working with you as well, A.
