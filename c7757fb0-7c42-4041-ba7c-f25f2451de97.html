Thank you for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm excited to explore Mumbai. Have you lived here your whole life?<p class="message sent">Yes, sir. Born and raised in Mumbai. It's a great city. You're going to enjoy it.<p class=message>That's awesome. I can't wait to taste some authentic Indian food. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Of course! You should try butter chicken and naan bread. It's a must-try for first timers.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll definitely give that a try. What's your favorite thing about Mumbai?<p class="message sent">Well, there's so much to love about this city, but I think it's the chaos and energy. There's always something happening here.<p class=message>I can imagine. It's definitely a change of pace from my quiet hometown. Hey, do you have any good music recommendations?<p class="message sent">You should check out Bollywood songs. They are very catchy and upbeat.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard of Bollywood before. I'll definitely listen to some. Say, have you ever been to any Bollywood movie sets?<p class="message sent">Yes! As a matter of fact, I've worked as an extra in a few movies. It's really exciting to see how everything comes together.<p class=message>Wow! That's impressive. You're the first taxi driver I've met who's also a Bollywood actor.<p class="message sent">Haha, well, I'm not exactly famous, but it's a fun little side gig.<p class=message>That's so cool. You seem like a really interesting person. Thanks for the conversation and for driving me around.<p class="message sent">The pleasure was mine, sir. Enjoy your stay in Mumbai!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c775136a-36b9-46b2-b20e-76431fa5a9a7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
