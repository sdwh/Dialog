How about you?<p class=message>Not bad at all. I've sold out of all my lavender macarons, they're a hit here.<p class="message sent">Oh, I've heard about those. I suppose people here really enjoy their lavender.<p class=message>Absolutely! And what about your products? Are they all locally-made?<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed. We use only the best fruits and honey from the farms around here.<p class=message>That sounds great. Which of your sweets is the most popular?<p class="message sent">Well, our fig jam is definitely a crowd-pleaser. It's made with fresh, ripe figs that are grown locally.<p class=message>Yum! I'll have to try some later. By the way, have you had any interesting encounters with customers today?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. One customer offered me a trade: his homemade goat cheese for a jar of my honey. I couldn't refuse!<p class=message>Ha, that's hilarious! You never know what kind of trades you'll get at a market like this.<p class="message sent">That's true. It's always an adventure. Speaking of adventure, have you had a chance to explore the city yet?<p class=message>I have! I went for a little bike ride earlier this morning. It's such a beautiful place.<p class="message sent">I agree. And the food here is fantastic too, isn't it?<p class=message>Oh, definitely. Have you tried any of the local cafes or restaurants?<p class="message sent">Yes, I went to this little bistro last night and had the most amazing ratatouille. I'm still thinking about it!<p class=message>Now you're making me hungry. I might have to take a little break and grab something to eat myself.<p class="message sent">Same here. I think it's time for a little snack break. Enjoy the rest of the market day!<p class=message>You too! It's been great chatting with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9529b531-5c3a-4d6d-9352-b993ec0e9582.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
