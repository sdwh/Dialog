We saw a lot of ducks in the pond.<p class=message>That sounds fun. Did your dad try to feed them?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but they were so greedy, they tried to steal the whole bag of bread from him.<p class=message>Haha, I bet that was a funny sight to see.<p class="message sent">It really was. We also went on the swings and the slide.<p class=message>I'm surprised your dad didn't get stuck in the slide.<p class="message sent">(laughs) He actually did get stuck, but he played it off cool like he meant to do that.<p class=message>Your dad sounds like a fun guy to be around.<p class="message sent">He is. He's always making me laugh with his jokes and silly faces.<p class=message>That's so nice. Did you guys bring any snacks with you?<p class="message sent">Yeah, my dad packed some fruit and granola bars. We had a little picnic on the grass.<p class=message>Sounds like a perfect day in the park with your dad. I'm glad you had a good time.<p class="message sent">Me too. Can we go to the park together next time? I think you'd like hanging out with my dad too.<p class=message>That would be awesome! Let's plan it out sometime.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0b7b4e65-eed6-4206-9b4d-a8787abcc834.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
