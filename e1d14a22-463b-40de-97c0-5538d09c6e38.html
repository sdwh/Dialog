Our users are expecting some top-notch stuff.<p class=message>I was thinking we should hire a team of monkeys to test our software.<p class="message sent">Monkeys? Are you serious?<p class=message>Absolutely, they're great at finding bugs and they work for peanuts.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I don't know about that. Maybe we could just do more testing ourselves?<p class=message>Yeah, that's probably the more sensible option. But a monkey testing team would definitely be interesting!<p class="message sent">(laughs) I agree, it would be. But let's focus on what we can do ourselves. Do you have any ideas?<p class=message>Well, we could do more automated testing. It would save us a lot of time and ensure consistent results.<p class="message sent">Good point. And maybe we could also try implementing some new testing methodologies, like exploratory or acceptance testing.<p class=message>Yes, those are definitely worth looking into. And we should also make sure our developers are writing clean and maintainable code.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And speaking of clean, maybe we should clean up our codebase too.<p class=message>Yeah, that would be a good idea. We could eliminate any redundant code and make it more efficient.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And let's not forget the importance of getting feedback from our users. That can help us improve things from their perspective.<p class=message>Great idea! Continuous improvement is the name of the game.<p class="message sent">That's right. And while we may not need to hire monkeys, we can still have some fun improving our software quality.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e1d03db9-c068-4ea2-8aca-9384a131812f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
