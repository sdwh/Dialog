I'm doing well, how about you?<p class=message>I'm good too, thanks. I was thinking, we should create a new dessert item for the menu.<p class="message sent">I like your idea! Any suggestions?<p class=message>How about we make a twist on the classic egg tart? Maybe add a new filling or a different crust?<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea, we could try using a cocoa crust or adding some fruit to the filling.<p class=message>Yes, that could really make it stand out. Speaking of which, have you tried the new tea we just got in stock?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it like?<p class=message>It's a delicate jasmine tea, perfect for pairing with our desserts.<p class="message sent">That sounds lovely, I'll have to try it out.<p class=message>Great! And while you're at it, can you teach me how to make your famous red bean soup?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, it's really simple. All you need are some red beans, rock sugar and some water.<p class=message>That sounds easy enough! You know, working with you has really broadened my knowledge of Chinese desserts.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. It's been such a pleasure to work together and share our passion for delicious treats.<p class=message>Absolutely! And hey, how about we start preparing for the upcoming Chinese New Year event next week?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a great idea. We can offer some special dishes and desserts for the occasion.<p class=message>Perfect, let's get to work then. Thank you for being such a wonderful partner, B.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, A. It's always a joy to work with someone as enthusiastic as you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7b74d903-d6dc-434c-9c60-7192bada65fb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
