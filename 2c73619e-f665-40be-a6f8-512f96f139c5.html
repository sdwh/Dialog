Hey, did you hear about that new hacking technique they've been using lately?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it all about?<p class=message>Apparently, hackers are using trained monkeys to hack into systems. They feed them bananas as a reward for success.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's hilarious! I guess we'll have to start putting up signs that say, "no monkeys allowed in the server room."<p class=message>(laughs) Definitely! Hey, speaking of bizarre things, have you ever heard of that company that created a helmet that can read your thoughts?<p class="message sent">What?! No way. That sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie.<p class=message>I know, right? I'm just glad we don't have to audit their security protocols.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Agreed. Although, I wouldn't mind an audit assignment on a tropical island instead of being cooped up in an office all day.<p class=message>(laughs) Yeah, that does sound nice. We could bring our own trained monkeys as backup security!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Perfect. We'll make sure to pack plenty of bananas. But for now, let's focus on this audit.<p class=message>(nods) Absolutely. Let's make sure we're doing our due diligence to keep our company's information secure.<p class="message sent">(smiles) Let's do it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2c72917f-2066-4644-80d9-5e9b15ef0dad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
