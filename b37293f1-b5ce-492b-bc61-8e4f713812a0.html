I hope not! But I can definitely take you to wherever you need to be in NYC, no problem."<p class=message>"Awesome, thanks! Do you have any recommendations for places to visit in the city?"<p class="message sent">"There's so much to see and do here, you can't go wrong. The Empire State Building, Central Park, Statue of Liberty, just to name a few!"<p class=message>"Sounds like a plan, but I also want to try some authentic New York pizza. Any suggestions?"<p class="message sent">"Absolutely! Joe's Pizza on Carmine Street is a classic spot. Or you can try Di Fara Pizza in Brooklyn, but be ready for a long wait!"<p class=message>"Great, thanks for the recommendations. Do you enjoy driving in New York City?"<p class="message sent">"Honestly, it can be a bit crazy at times, but I love it. You'll never know what you'll see or who you'll meet when driving around here."<p class=message>"That's true! Have you ever had any interesting encounters while driving?"<p class="message sent">"Oh yeah, I have plenty of stories! I once had an opera singer sing me a solo during a ride, and another time, a celebrity hopped in the backseat. You never know!"<p class=message>"Wow, that's amazing! Do you have a favorite type of music you listen to while driving?"<p class="message sent">"I actually love listening to talk radio, especially political shows. It keeps me up-to-date on current events."<p class=message>"Interesting, I prefer music. What's your favorite genre?"<p class="message sent">"I'm a big fan of jazz, it's so relaxing and sets the tone for a great ride. But I also enjoy some classic rock from time to time."<p class=message>"I see! What's the craziest thing you've ever seen on the streets of New York City?"<p class="message sent">"Hmm, that's a tough one. I've seen it all! But one time, a group of people dressed in superhero costumes were chasing each other down the street. That was definitely a sight to see!"<p class=message>"Sounds like a scene straight out of a movie! Well, thanks for the ride and the lively conversation. You truly are a New York treasure."<p class="message sent">"Thank you, it was my pleasure. Enjoy your stay in the Big Apple!"</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b370df4a-8422-43ca-8006-dc3913f2be5b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
