How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm just passing through this town and I was intrigued by your little store. What kind of local specialties do you have here?<p class=message>Well, we have some really delicious smoked salmon that's caught fresh right off the coast here in Hokkaido. We also have some handmade crafts made by the locals.<p class="message sent">That sounds great, I'll definitely take some of that smoked salmon. What else do you recommend?<p class=message>Our Hokkaido milk candies are really popular. They’re made with fresh milk from local farms.<p class="message sent">That definitely sounds worth a try. How long have you been running this place?<p class=message>I’ve been running this store for about 10 years now. Business is good, and I love meeting all the different people who come through town.<p class="message sent">It must be quite an experience to live in a small town like this.<p class=message>Yes, it definitely has its charms. We all know each other here, and there’s always something going on in town.<p class="message sent">That sounds delightful. Do you have any recommendations for local restaurants or cafes?<p class=message>Yes, there's a great little cafe down the street that serves amazing Hokkaido-style ramen. It's a must-try if you're in town.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds perfect. Thank you so much for your help. I'll definitely come back here if I'm ever in the area again.<p class=message>You're welcome! Have a safe trip, and enjoy your Hokkaido specialties!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=92544a4d-0a6b-4bc8-bc1e-99bca2770a61.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
