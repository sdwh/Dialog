Yes, I'm having some trouble with my landlord. He's been ignoring my requests for repairs.<p class=message>I see. Have you tried sending him a written notice?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did, but he still hasn't done anything about it.<p class=message>Alright, let me take a look at your lease agreement. Hmm... it looks like there's a clause that requires him to maintain the property.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's what I thought!<p class=message>Well, we can send him a formal demand letter and if he doesn't respond, we can take legal action.<p class="message sent">Great, let's do that. On a different note, have you seen any good movies lately?<p class=message>Actually, yes! I watched The Godfather for the first time last week.<p class="message sent">Wow, really? What did you think?<p class=message>It was amazing. The writing, directing, and acting were all top-notch.<p class="message sent">I know, right? It's a classic for a reason.<p class=message>Definitely. Speaking of classics, have you ever read To Kill a Mockingbird?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's one of my favorites.<p class=message>Mine too! In fact, I named my dog Atticus after the main character.<p class="message sent">That's so cool! I'm thinking about getting a pet myself.<p class=message>Oh, what kind?<p class="message sent">I'm not sure yet. Maybe a cat or a dog.<p class=message>Well, if you need any advice on that matter, I can definitely help you out. But for now, let's focus on getting your landlord to make those repairs.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e08c9c13-b8c6-4be3-87cf-17ce7ff88adb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
