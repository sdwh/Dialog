We're going to use Vue.js and ASP.NET MVC 5 for it, right?<p class=message>That's correct. I'm pretty excited to work with Vue.js again. What do you think?<p class="message sent">I'm more experienced with ASP.NET MVC 5, but I'm open to using Vue.js. I heard it's a really great framework.<p class=message>Oh, it is. It's very easy to use and has really good documentation. Plus, it makes front-end development much more enjoyable.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Speaking of enjoyable, have you tried out any new coding games lately?<p class=message>Yeah, I actually found this one where you have to program a robot to escape a maze. It was really fun and challenging.<p class="message sent">Nice! I'm always up for a good coding game. Which one was it?<p class=message>It's called RoboZZle. You should try it out.<p class="message sent">I definitely will. Thanks for the recommendation. So, do you think we'll be able to finish this project on time?<p class=message>With our combined skills, I have no doubt we can finish it on time and even exceed expectations.<p class="message sent">I agree. This project will definitely showcase our strengths as both front-end and back-end developers.<p class=message>Absolutely. And who knows, maybe we'll even get some recognition for it.<p class="message sent">Fingers crossed! Let's get started on this project and turn it into something amazing.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=374e0fc5-d954-44da-8758-30af0f3b5773.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
