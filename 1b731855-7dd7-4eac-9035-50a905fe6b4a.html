You must be the manager of the travel company. I'm A, a fisherman here at the port.<p class="message sent">Yes, hello A. Nice to meet you. I'm B, the manager of the travel agency that brings tourists to your village.<p class=message>Great! I've been hearing a lot about how promoting tourism can help our village prosper. Can you tell me more about what you do?<p class="message sent">Our travel company specializes in promoting lesser-known places to travelers. We can help your village get the attention it deserves by creating unique tour packages that cater to the interests of potential visitors.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. But what makes our fishing village stand out from other tourist destinations?<p class="message sent">Well, we can showcase the authenticity of the fishing village and make visitors experience the daily lives of fishermen. We can create a tour where guests can learn how to fish or help with catching shellfish.<p class=message>Ah, that sounds like a lot of fun! I think I might even learn a thing or two myself.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we can also promote your local cuisine. Your village specializes in seafood, right? We can create culinary tours where guests can taste the freshest seafood prepared in the local style.<p class=message>Yes, we have a lot of seafood here. I recommend the steamed fish with lemon and garlic. It's a local favorite!<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! I'll make sure to include it in our tour package.<p class=message>Great! I'm excited to see more visitors come to our village and experience what we have to offer.<p class="message sent">And we're excited to promote your village to the world.
