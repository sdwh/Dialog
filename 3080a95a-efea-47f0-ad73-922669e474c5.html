He has been very fussy lately.<p class=message>Sure thing, what are his symptoms?<p class="message sent">Well, he has a bit of a cough and also seems to be teething.<p class=message>Okay, for the cough, I recommend this cough syrup specifically made for babies. And for teething, we have some teething gel that can help soothe his gums.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Are there any side effects we should be aware of?<p class=message>The cough syrup may cause drowsiness, so it's best to give it to him before bedtime. As for the teething gel, just make sure not to apply too much and keep an eye on him in case of any allergic reactions.<p class="message sent">Thank you for the advice. I was also wondering, what's the dosage for his age?<p class=message>For the cough syrup, about 2.5 ml for every 5 kg of body weight. And for the teething gel, just a pea-sized amount.<p class="message sent">Got it, thank you. I really appreciate your help.<p class=message>No problem at all. Do you need anything else?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. Do you have any recommendations for a good diaper rash cream?<p class=message>Yes, we have this one that's really popular with parents. It's made with natural ingredients and is gentle on the skin.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I'll take that too. Thank you again!<p class=message>You're welcome, happy to help. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=307ed0ab-f8cc-4769-b706-a93a353d25a8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
