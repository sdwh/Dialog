How's the manuscript coming along?<p class=message>I think it's coming together nicely. I just need to add a few more finishing touches.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Have you thought about any illustrations to include?<p class=message>Yes, actually. I have a friend who is a talented artist and I think she would be perfect for the job.<p class="message sent">Fantastic. Let's see if we can get a budget set aside for that.<p class=message>That would be excellent. By the way, have you read any good books lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I just finished a mystery novel that kept me on the edge of my seat.<p class=message>Oh, I love a good mystery. Care to share the title and author?<p class="message sent">It's called "The Silent Patient" by Alex Michaelides.<p class=message>Sounds intriguing. I'll have to check it out.<p class="message sent">You should. Speaking of mysteries, did you see the latest episode of that show we were discussing last week?<p class=message>Yes, it was great! I can't wait to see what happens next.<p class="message sent">Me too. All right, back to business. Is there anything else you need from me today?<p class=message>No, I think that's all for now. Thanks for your help, as always.<p class="message sent">Of course. Let me know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=69940ddf-915c-46f4-98c8-4b6ff3343bbc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
