Honestly, it's a daunting task.<p class=message>Definitely, but I think if we collaborate and come up with a plan, we can make it happen.<p class="message sent">Agreed. One thing we can do is implement automated tests for our commonly used features.<p class=message>That's a good idea. It'll save us time and effort.<p class="message sent">Additionally, we can also use exploratory testing to identify any areas that haven't been covered yet.<p class=message>Yes, and we can document our testing progress in a test coverage report so that we can keep track of our progress.<p class="message sent">Smart thinking. We can also prioritize our test cases based on risk analysis.<p class=message>Exactly. And we can also use code coverage tools to ensure that all lines of code are tested.<p class="message sent">Great idea, A. As we move forward with our testing, we can also continuously analyze our test results to identify any areas that need improvement.<p class=message>I completely agree. And we can also involve team members from different departments to get their perspective on how we can improve our testing.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a great way to collaborate and make sure we have all our bases covered.<p class=message>Overall, I think we have a solid plan to achieve full test coverage.<p class="message sent">I agree. I feel much better about it now. Thanks for your help, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. It's always good to brainstorm and bounce ideas off each other.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a6a3c16d-b2b5-44f1-b1d3-67cd139d1866.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
