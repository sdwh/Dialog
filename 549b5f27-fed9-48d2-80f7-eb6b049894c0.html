How about you?<p class=message>Not bad. We have a lot of work to do for the internal system development project.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know. But I'm confident we can finish this on time.<p class=message>I hope so. By the way, did you catch the latest episode of that new series we were talking about last week?<p class="message sent">Yes! It was great. The plot is really getting interesting.<p class=message>I agree. Maybe we can catch up on it during our next break.<p class="message sent">Definitely. So, have you had any luck with that coding problem we were struggling with last time?<p class=message>Actually, I think I found a solution. What do you think about combining that Javascript library with the Ruby on Rails framework?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I'll start working on that right away.<p class=message>And I'll keep researching and see if I can find any other useful resources.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. It's always great working with you, A. You really have some brilliant ideas.<p class=message>Thanks, B. It's a pleasure working with you too. Let's get back to work and finish this project together.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5495b173-4cc3-4c21-835d-9a8c12e10ec1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
