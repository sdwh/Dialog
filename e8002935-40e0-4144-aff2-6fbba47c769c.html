But overall, the code quality seems decent.<p class=message>Great, thanks for checking. What issues did you find?<p class="message sent">Mostly some syntax errors and a few unused variables. Oh, also some potential memory leaks.<p class=message>Hmm, that doesn't sound too bad. How do you suggest we go about fixing these issues?<p class="message sent">It might be best to start by addressing the syntax errors first. That should help us avoid bigger problems down the line.<p class=message>That makes sense. Do you think we should write some unit tests to help us catch these kinds of errors in the future?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Writing tests can save us a lot of headache and time. Plus, it's always satisfying to see the tests pass.<p class=message>Agreed. By the way, did you see that article about the developer who accidentally deleted all their code?<p class="message sent">Yeah, that was crazy. I'm glad we have a good backup system in place.<p class=message>Me too. But it's always a good reminder to be careful with our code.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Speaking of which, have you taken any steps to prevent code injection attacks?<p class=message>Funny you should mention that. I've been reading up on best practices for preventing those kinds of attacks. I'll send you some links.<p class="message sent">Thanks, that's great. As they say, "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."<p class=message>Very true. Well, it looks like we have our work cut out for us. But I'm confident we can make our code even better.<p class="message sent">Yeah, with you on the team, I'm sure we'll come out on top.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e7f4f7ce-a676-4051-8958-e5c46ab0ad01.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
