Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm the system administrator. Nice to meet you too.<p class=message>I heard we're here to discuss how to build a safe and reliable corporate network infrastructure?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. Our company needs a network that can withstand cyber attacks.<p class=message>Absolutely. Have you had any experience dealing with security breaches before?<p class="message sent">Yes, unfortunately. We had an incident where hackers penetrated our previous network security protocols.<p class=message>Oh no. Well, I'm here to make sure that doesn't happen again. We can start by creating a multi-level security protocol.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Our system is complex, so that would definitely provide multiple layers of protection.<p class=message>Exactly. We also need to make sure that all the employees are trained in cyber safety and understand the importance of strong passwords.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's often where the biggest threat to security comes from: human error.<p class=message>Exactly. We should also consider backup and disaster recovery measures in the event of a major breach.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We need to have plans in place to quickly get back up and running in case of an attack.<p class=message>Yes, having regular backups and testing those backups regularly is essential.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And we should also monitor our network traffic for suspicious activity.<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's work together to develop a comprehensive cyber security plan to keep our company and its data safe.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great plan, A. Looking forward to working with you!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=344024b5-aecd-41dd-8ae2-026c6e10fb95.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
