How's the development going?<p class="message sent">It's going well. I'm working on implementing a new feature using Node.js.<p class=message>Nice, what kind of feature is it?<p class="message sent">It's a feature that automatically sends an email notification to users after they make a transaction.<p class=message>That sounds great! Have you encountered any challenges?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been struggling a bit with integrating with the email API, but I'm making progress.<p class=message>Don't worry, you'll get there. On a different note, what did you do over the weekend?<p class="message sent">I went hiking with some friends. It was great to get some fresh air and exercise after being cooped up indoors.<p class=message>Oh, I envy you. I've been spending most of my weekends indoors working on side projects.<p class="message sent">That's important too, but you should take breaks and enjoy some outdoor activities. It's good for the body and mind.<p class=message>That's true. Maybe I'll plan a hiking trip soon. By the way, have you watched any good shows lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been watching a comedy series on Netflix. It's hilarious, you should check it out.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation. I'll definitely give it a watch. Anyway, let's get back to work. We have a deadline to meet.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's crush it and get this feature implemented on time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=237fa2a8-bdcc-47ae-b9e8-b488636112c4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
