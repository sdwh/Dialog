My name is A, and I will be your sushi chef for tonight.<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you, A. I'm B, the sake bartender. I'm excited to work with you tonight.<p class=message>Same to you, B. Let's get started. What would you like to serve first?<p class="message sent">How about we start with some edamame? The perfect appetizer for sake.<p class=message>Great idea! I'll prepare the edamame while you pour our first round of sake.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. So, A, how long have you been working as a sushi chef?<p class=message>I've been making sushi for about 10 years now. It's been quite the journey, but I absolutely love it.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. Your love for sushi definitely shows in your work. So, what's your personal favorite type of sushi to make?<p class=message>That's a tough one. I'd have to say my favorite is the classic salmon roe sushi. It's simple yet so flavorful.<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. I love salmon roe too. It's so satisfying to pop in your mouth. Speaking of satisfying, have you tried our signature sake cocktail yet?<p class=message>I have not. What's in it?<p class="message sent">It's a mix of sake, peach liqueur, and fresh peach juice. It's refreshing and sweet. Perfect for summer.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll have to try it when we finish preparing these orders.<p class="message sent">Definitely do. So, what do you like to do outside of work, A?<p class=message>I enjoy hiking and practicing martial arts. Keeps me active and centered.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's really cool! Do you have any favorite spots to hike around Shanghai?<p class=message>Definitely the Sheshan National Forest Park. It's a great escape from the city and has amazing scenery.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. I'll have to try it someday. Alright, our orders are ready for serving. Let's wow our guests with our skills and delicious food.<p class=message>Agreed! Let's do this, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=81550bfc-e86f-44ae-84d4-14f166beb640.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
