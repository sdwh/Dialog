Can I see your license and registration, please?<p class="message sent">Of course, officer. Here you go.<p class=message>Thank you. Do you know why I pulled you over today?<p class="message sent">Not really, officer. Was I speeding?<p class=message>No, but you were veering a bit in your lane. Have you had enough rest today?<p class="message sent">Oh, sorry about that. Yes, I had a good night's sleep, but I guess I got a bit distracted.<p class=message>That's okay. Just remember to stay focused while driving. We don't want accidents on the road, do we?<p class="message sent">Absolutely not. I'll try to keep my eyes on the road from now on.<p class=message>Great. By the way, I love the design of your car. Is it a vintage model?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. It's a 1970 Pontiac GTO.<p class=message>Wow, that's really cool. My grandpa used to have one like that.<p class="message sent">Really? It's a classic muscle car. I love taking it out for a spin on weekends.<p class=message>I can imagine. It must be fun to drive.<p class="message sent">It sure is. But I'll try to be more careful next time, officer. Thanks for reminding me.<p class=message>No problem, sir. Just doing my job. Drive safe and have a good day.<p class="message sent">You too, officer. Have a good one.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1dab7c2e-b7fe-4cbb-ad98-5e629d048549.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
