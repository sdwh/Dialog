My name's Sarah. Thanks for picking me up, driver. How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent message-content">Hi Sarah! My name is Jack. I've been driving a taxi for about 5 years now. It's been a good job for me.<p class="message received message-content">That's great to hear. You seem like you're enjoying it. Do you like driving through the busy streets of Guangzhou?<p class="message sent message-content">It can be a bit hectic, but I'm used to it by now. Plus, I get to meet interesting people like you along the way.<p class="message received message-content">Speaking of interesting people, have you met any famous people in your taxi?<p class="message sent message-content">Actually, I did have a celebrity passenger once. Can you guess who it was?<p class="message received message-content">Hmm, maybe a singer or an actor?<p class="message sent message-content">Close, but it was actually a famous athlete. It was Yao Ming, the basketball player.<p class="message received message-content">Wow! That must have been so exciting! Was he tall in person?<p class="message sent message-content">He was definitely taller than me! But he was very friendly and down-to-earth. It was a great experience.<p class="message received message-content">That's amazing. I don't think I'll ever get to meet a celebrity in a taxi. Unless, of course, you count me as a celebrity!<p class="message sent message-content">Of course, Sarah! You're the most important passenger I've had today.<p class="message received message-content">Haha, thanks Jack. You're such a nice taxi driver. Do you have any favorite hobbies or interests outside of driving?<p class="message sent message-content">I actually really enjoy playing basketball. I used to play in a local league, but I don't have as much time for it now.<p class="message received message-content">That's cool! Do you have a favorite team or player?<p class="message sent message-content">I'm a big fan of the Houston Rockets, so I always root for them. But my favorite player is actually a retired one - Michael Jordan. He was just amazing to watch.<p class="message received message-content">Wow, you really know your basketball! I'm more of a casual fan, but I enjoy watching the games too.<p class="message sent message-content">Maybe we should go see a game together sometime. I could be your personal taxi driver!<p class="message received message-content">That sounds like fun. Maybe when I come back to Guangzhou, we can make it happen.<p class="message sent message-content">Great idea, Sarah. I'll look forward to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0393053d-6248-4f3f-aa95-01774eaebe52.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
