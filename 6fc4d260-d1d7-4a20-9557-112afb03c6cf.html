Just working on some math problems.<p class=message>Math can be tough, do you need any help?<p class="message sent">No, I think I'm okay for now. But maybe later if I get stuck.<p class=message>Sure, just let me know. What other assignments do you have?<p class="message sent">I have some reading to do for English class and a history worksheet to complete.<p class=message>Ah, history was always my favorite subject in school. What period are you studying?<p class="message sent">The American Revolution. It's interesting but there's a lot to remember.<p class=message>Yes, there certainly is. But it's important to know our country's history. Can I quiz you on some of it?<p class="message sent">Sure! Let's see if I'm ready for the test.<p class=message>Okay, who was the first president of the United States?<p class="message sent">George Washington.<p class=message>Great job! And who wrote the Declaration of Independence?<p class="message sent">Thomas Jefferson.<p class=message>Excellent! I think you're going to do great on your assignment. Oh, and don't forget to take breaks and have some fun too.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Mom. Can we take a break and watch a movie later?<p class=message>Of course! What do you want to watch?<p class="message sent">How about that comedy we rented last week?<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let's finish your homework first and then we can relax and have a laugh.<p class="message sent">Deal! Thanks for helping me, Mom.
