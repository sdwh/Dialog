Welcome to our car rental company. We have a wide range of vehicles to choose from. What type of vehicle are you looking for?<p class=message>I think something spacious and comfortable would be great for the tourists. Do you have any SUVs or vans available?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have both. Is there a specific make or model that the tourists would prefer?<p class=message>Well, they would really love something eco-friendly. Do you have any hybrid vehicles in your fleet?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do have some hybrid SUVs available. I can show you a few options if you'd like?<p class=message>That would be fantastic. Also, do you have any suggestions for scenic routes that they should take while exploring Melbourne?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! The Great Ocean Road is an absolute must-see. It's about a 3-hour drive from Melbourne, but you'll see breathtaking views of the coastline and get a chance to visit beautiful beaches along the way.<p class=message>Sounds perfect. Do you have any other recommendations?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. The Yarra Valley is another beautiful destination that is about an hour's drive from Melbourne. It's a wine region, so if your group loves wine and beautiful landscapes, they will definitely enjoy the Yarra Valley.<p class=message>Great! I'll definitely recommend those places to my group. Thank you so much for your help.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It was a pleasure helping you. Let me know if you need any more assistance or have any further questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b6cbf834-7320-4309-9da4-a32a951a14f2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
