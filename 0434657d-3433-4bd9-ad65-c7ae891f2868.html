What's up? Are you ready to play some Switch?<p class="message sent message-content">Of course, I am! I just got a new game yesterday. Have you heard of "Animal Crossing?"<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, I've heard of it. My sister is addicted to that game. How is it?<p class="message sent message-content">It's really fun! You get to build your own little village and interact with these adorable animal characters. I can't believe how much time I've spent on it already.<p class="message received message-content">Hmm, maybe I should try it out. Speaking of games, have you tried "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" yet?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh yes, I have! I love playing as Bowser Jr. and wrecking everyone's kart.<p class="message received message-content">Haha, I'm more of a traditional Mario player myself. Super Mario Odyssey was amazing.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, definitely. I loved exploring all the different kingdoms and collecting Power Moons. And the final boss battle was epic.<p class="message received message-content">Agreed. Hey, have you ever played "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild?"<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, it's one of my top favorites. I love how expansive the game is and how many secrets there are to discover.<p class="message received message-content">Me too! But I still haven't gotten around to finishing it yet.<p class="message sent message-content">Same here, I get distracted by side quests a lot.<p class="message received message-content">Haha, same. What other games do you recommend?<p class="message sent message-content">"Splatoon 2" is a really unique and addictive shooter game. And "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" is always a good time, especially when playing with friends.<p class="message received message-content">"Splatoon 2" sounds interesting. I've never been a big fan of shooter games, but maybe I'll give it a try.<p class="message sent message-content">You definitely should! And if you need any tips or tricks, just let me know.<p class="message received message-content">Thanks, I appreciate it. It's always fun playing Switch with you, B.<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, it's nice to have someone to talk to about these games. Let's play again soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0430f35c-aa65-4e43-83b4-d292dde6b4ae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
