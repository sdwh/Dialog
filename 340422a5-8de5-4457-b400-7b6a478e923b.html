What's it all about?<p class=message>Well, it's a set of international standards for managing information security. Specifically, it covers data backup and recovery.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. So it's about making sure your important data is protected and can be easily restored if something goes wrong.<p class=message>Exactly! And it's becoming more and more important as companies rely more on technology to run their businesses.<p class="message sent">I see. So what are some of the key requirements for ISO 27001 Backup?<p class=message>Well, one is that backups need to be taken regularly and stored securely. And you also need to have a clear plan for restoring data in case of a disaster.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I guess it's important to have a backup plan for your backup plan!<p class=message>Haha, yes, you can never be too careful when it comes to data security.<p class="message sent">So how does ISO 27001 Backup compare to other backup standards out there?<p class=message>From what I've seen, it's one of the most comprehensive and reliable sets of standards available. It covers everything from the frequency of backups to testing the backup and recovery system.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a lot of detail to keep track of.<p class=message>Definitely. That's why a lot of companies hire third-party auditors to make sure they're fully compliant with ISO 27001 Backup.<p class="message sent">I can see why. It's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to data security.<p class=message>Absolutely. Plus, being certified in ISO 27001 Backup can help companies gain a competitive advantage and attract more reliable customers.<p class="message sent">That's definitely something to keep in mind. Thanks for explaining all this to me, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to talk about the fascinating world of data backup and recovery!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=34010790-6454-4cb6-9ed0-a7726852dd18.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
