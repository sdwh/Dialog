How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. I'm doing great. How about you?<p class=message>I'm fine, thank you. I'm excited to be working with you today. Have you ever worked in a Korean restaurant before?<p class="message sent">No, this is my first time working in a Korean restaurant. I'm excited to learn about Korean cuisine.<p class=message>That's great. Korean cuisine is really diverse and unique. We have many dishes that are made with fermented ingredients like kimchi and soy sauce.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds interesting. What are we preparing today?<p class=message>Today, we are serving bibimbap and bulgogi, which are both very popular Korean dishes.<p class="message sent">Oh, I've heard of bibimbap before. It's the one with the mixed vegetables and rice, right?<p class=message>Yes, it is. And bulgogi is a marinated beef dish. We have to marinate the beef for at least an hour before cooking it.<p class="message sent">Got it. So, what should I do first?<p class=message>First, let's greet our customers and take their orders. Then, we can start preparing the ingredients for the dishes.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. By the way, do you have any recommendations for side dishes that would complement the dishes?<p class=message>Sure, we have many options, such as kimchi, pickled vegetables, and steamed egg.<p class="message sent">Mmm, all of those sound delicious. I think I'll try the steamed egg.<p class=message>Great choice. I'll make sure to bring some out for you later. Now, let's get started with prepping the ingredients.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. I'm ready to get my hands dirty.<p class=message>(chuckles) That's the spirit. Let's make some delicious Korean food!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a65bac73-e123-417c-a5bb-c2a9c4db3329.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
