Speaking of which, have you tried our new oolong blend?<p class=message>No, not yet. I've been too busy prepping these orders. Those shrimp tempura rolls aren't going to make themselves!<p class="message sent">Ha, I know the feeling. Hey, did you hear about our lunchtime bento special?<p class=message>No, what is it?<p class="message sent">It's a chicken teriyaki bento with a side of miso soup and a green tea for only 800 yen.<p class=message>Wow, that's an amazing deal.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and the customers seem to love it. I can barely keep up with their tea orders.<p class=message>Well, I'm glad we have each other to help out. Can you pass me the soy sauce?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. By the way, did you see that article about the best bento shop in Osaka?<p class=message>No, I haven't. We made the list?<p class="message sent">We sure did! The writer praised your sushi rolls in particular.<p class=message>Aw, thanks. That means a lot to me. Speaking of sushi rolls, can you taste this one and tell me if it needs more wasabi?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Mmm, just the right amount. You always have a good sense of flavor balance.<p class=message>Well, that's because I love food. And making people happy with it is even better.<p class="message sent">Agreed. There's nothing like seeing a customer's face light up when they take that first bite.<p class=message>Exactly! Now, let's finish up these orders and then take a well-deserved break with some tea and bento boxes of our own.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1384f1f9-2371-4bb8-9cc0-15c610101cd8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
