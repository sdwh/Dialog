How's it going with the repairs?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, A. This tractor just needed a new spark plug and air filter, so it's good to go now.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I was worried we might need to replace some major parts.<p class="message sent">Nah, this old girl is in pretty good shape overall. How about that plow you were working on earlier?<p class=message>I replaced a couple of worn-out blades and greased up the bearings, so it's running smoothly again.<p class="message sent">Nice work. It's always satisfying to see the results of a good repair job.<p class=message>Speaking of repairs, have you ever had to fix anything on your own vehicle?<p class="message sent">Sure have. I once had to replace the starter motor on my pickup truck in the middle of a camping trip. Not the most pleasant experience, but it got the job done.<p class=message>Impressive. I once tried to change my own oil and ended up covered in grease from head to toe. Needless to say, I stick to farm machinery now.<p class="message sent">Haha, I hear you. Farm equipment can definitely be a bit more forgiving than some vehicles.<p class=message>Yeah, and at least the cows don't complain if we take a little longer to get things fixed.<p class="message sent">Can't argue with that. It's always good to have some understanding customers.<p class=message>Well, I think we've covered everything we needed to. Thanks for your help, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Always happy to work with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8d0b42af-5807-41e2-a7f8-c4bad080c79b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
