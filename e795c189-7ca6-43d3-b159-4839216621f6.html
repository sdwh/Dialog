What's the objective of the game?<p class=message>We have to solve different puzzles by using logic and critical thinking skills.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. Do you have any tips for me before we start?<p class=message>Just make sure to pay attention to every detail and think outside the box.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's start. Hmm, this first puzzle seems tricky. Do you have any ideas?<p class=message>Let's try to break it down into smaller pieces and see if we can figure it out step by step.<p class="message sent">Good idea. I think we're getting closer. Wait, what's that noise coming from outside?<p class=message>I have no idea. Let me check. It's just my neighbor practicing their trombone again. Let's just ignore it and keep solving the puzzle.<p class="message sent">Yeah, let's do that. I think we're almost there. Just a few more pieces to put together.<p class=message>Yes, we did it! The puzzle is solved. High five!<p class="message sent">Awesome! That was really fun. Do you want to try another level?<p class=message>Definitely. Let's see if we can solve it even faster this time.<p class="message sent">Challenge accepted. I'm ready when you are.<p class=message>Okay, let's do it.
