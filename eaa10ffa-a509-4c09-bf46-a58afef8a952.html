I couldn't help but notice that some of the fish you're selling here don't look as fresh as they should be.<p class="message sent">Oh, is that so? I always make sure to get my fish directly from the source.<p class=message>That's great to hear, but unfortunately, freshness is not the only criterion for high-quality fish.<p class="message sent">Really? What else matters?<p class=message>Well, for one, the way the fish are stored after they're caught can greatly affect the taste and texture.<p class="message sent">I see. So what can I do to improve my fish's quality and value?<p class=message>You could invest in a better storage system, like a refrigerated truck, to keep the fish fresh for longer. Additionally, you could try catching rarer or more exotic fish species to attract high-end customers.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I appreciate the advice. Although, I'm not sure I could get my hands on those types of fish.<p class=message>Don't worry, there are plenty of other things you can do. How about taking better care of the fish before they're caught, like giving them a proper diet and environment?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I never thought about that before. Thank you for your help. I'll be sure to implement some of these changes.<p class=message>You're welcome! And remember, high-quality fish not only taste better, but they can also fetch a higher price in the market.<p class="message sent">I'll keep that in mind. Thanks again for your suggestions. It's always refreshing to learn something new about my line of work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ea9dec9a-8780-4393-81bb-d0638bf04ba1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
