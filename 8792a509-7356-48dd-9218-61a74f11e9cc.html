There's like five different hot dog stands on this block.<p class=message>The one with the neon green and orange cart.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I think I've seen it. Is it any good?<p class=message>It's amazing! The bun is soft, the sausage is juicy, and the toppings are on point.<p class="message sent">Sounds like you really liked it. What kind of toppings did they have?<p class=message>There were so many options! I went for the classic ketchup and mustard, but they had sauerkraut, onions, relish, chili, and even cheese!<p class="message sent">Cheese on a hot dog? That's a new one for me.<p class=message>Yeah, it was a little weird, but it actually tasted pretty good.<p class="message sent">Interesting. So, how much does it cost?<p class=message>The basic hot dog starts at $3, but if you add toppings or want a meal deal, it can go up to $8 or $10.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's not too bad for a quick lunch option.<p class=message>Exactly! It's tasty, affordable, and you don't have to sit down for a formal meal.<p class="message sent">Have you tried the other hot dog stands around here though? Maybe we should do a taste test.<p class=message>Challenge accepted! Let's make it a hot dog crawl.<p class="message sent">Wait, we should probably invite more people or else it'll be a competition between just two of us.<p class=message>Good point. We can turn it into a hot dog party!<p class="message sent">Yes! We can bring some beers and make it a whole afternoon activity.<p class=message>This might be the best idea we've ever had.<p class="message sent">Cheers to that and to hot dogs!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8790231d-82ab-4b39-95c3-072e1c0eb476.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
