How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. Have you ordered anything yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've ordered a burger and fries. What about you?<p class=message>I went for the fish and chips. Can't resist a good British classic.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. So, A, what brings you to this restaurant today?<p class=message>Just needed to get out of the office for a bit. Plus, I heard they have some great desserts here.<p class="message sent">Oh really? Have you tried the cheesecake yet? It's out of this world.<p class=message>No, I haven't. Maybe I'll have to try it before we leave. How's work been treating you, B?<p class="message sent">Not too bad. Just trying to keep up with all the emails and meetings. But it's all good.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I don't envy you with all the emails though.<p class="message sent">Ha, yeah. It's just part of the job. So, any exciting plans for the weekend, A?<p class=message>Not really. Just some errands to run and maybe catch up on some Netflix. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm actually going to a concert on Saturday. Pretty excited about that.<p class=message>Nice! Who are you going to see?<p class="message sent">A local band called The Strangers. They're supposed to be really good.<p class=message>That sounds awesome. I'll have to check them out sometime.<p class="message sent">Definitely. They're worth a listen. Oh, and here comes our food.<p class=message>Great, I'm famished. Let's dig in.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And don't forget about that cheesecake afterwards!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8560f862-1c66-4660-81aa-1188beccf15e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
