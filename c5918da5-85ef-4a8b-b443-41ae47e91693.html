Are you excited for today's session?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I have been feeling quite stressed out lately and I heard yoga can help with that.<p class=message>Definitely. Yoga is not just about physical exercise but also about mental relaxation. Let's start with some breathing exercises.<p class="message sent">(taking deep breaths) Wow, that already feels so calming.<p class=message>Great job. Now let's move on to some poses. We'll start with the downward-facing dog.<p class="message sent">Whoa, this is harder than it looks!<p class=message>It takes time and practice. One of the most important things in yoga is to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard.<p class="message sent">Got it. (struggling to hold the pose)<p class=message>(giggling) And remember, it's okay to fall over. We all do it at some point.<p class="message sent">(laughing) That's good to know.<p class=message>Alright, let's move on to some hip openers. These can be a little uncomfortable at first, but they're great for releasing tension.<p class="message sent">(grimacing) I can definitely feel that!<p class=message>Just breathe through it. And remember, it's not about achieving the perfect pose, it's about doing what feels good for your body.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I needed to hear that. (smiling)<p class=message>You're doing great, B. Let's end with some final stretches and a relaxation pose.<p class="message sent">(sighing) That feels amazing.<p class=message>Glad to hear it. How do you feel overall?<p class="message sent">I feel so much more relaxed and at ease. I can't wait for the next session.<p class=message>That's great to hear. See you next time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c58fa299-e633-4eb2-b9d0-dbbaaa77f652.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
