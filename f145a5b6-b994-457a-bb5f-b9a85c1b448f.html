How do you manage to keep them so fresh?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's all in the way they're harvested and stored. We make sure to pick only the ripe fruits and store them in a cool place.<p class=message>That's interesting. I'm a farmer, and I've been trying to improve my sales of fresh fruits lately. Do you have any tips for me?<p class="message sent">Sure, first of all, you should make sure your fruits are visually appealing. People tend to buy what looks good.<p class=message>That's true. What about the pricing, though? Should I match your prices or go lower?<p class="message sent">It really depends on your target customers. If they're willing to pay more for quality, then you can set a higher price. But if they're more price-sensitive, you might want to go lower.<p class=message>Got it. And how do you attract customers to your stall?<p class="message sent">We offer free samples to let them taste and experience the freshness for themselves. And we always make sure to have a clean and eye-catching display.<p class=message>That sounds like a great strategy. Thanks for the advice!<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help a fellow seller. Good luck with your sales!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f1429f86-ff4b-4c28-bd6a-b418239a23df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
