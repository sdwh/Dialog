How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I feel a little better, thank you. The pain in my leg is not as bad as it was yesterday.<p class=message>That's good to hear. You're making progress then. I noticed you have a book with you. What are you reading?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a romance novel. It helps distract me from my pain and the hospital environment.<p class=message>Ah, I see. I enjoy reading romance novels too. Who's the author of the book you're currently reading?<p class="message sent">It's by Nora Roberts. Have you read any of her books?<p class=message>Yes, she's a great author! I love her books about strong female characters. Do you have any recommendations for me?<p class="message sent">Yes, I highly recommend "High Noon" and "The Witness". Both have strong female leads and gripping plots.<p class=message>Thank you for the recommendations. I'll make sure to check them out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was wondering if I could get some fresh fruit for breakfast. Do you know if that's possible?<p class=message>Of course! Our kitchen has a fresh fruit program. I'll make sure to put in a request for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you, that's very kind of you. You're such a helpful nurse.<p class=message>It's part of my job to make sure you're comfortable and happy during your stay here. Is there anything else you need or want to discuss?<p class="message sent">No, that's all for now. Thank you again for your help.<p class=message>You're welcome. Please let me know if you need anything else. Have a pleasant day and keep reading that book!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e2360498-1e71-4128-8ac3-217a213013b5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
