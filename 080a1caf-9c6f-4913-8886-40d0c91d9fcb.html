I heard you're working on a new puzzle game, can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent message-content">Hey A, yeah I am! It's going to be a brain teaser packed with all sorts of challenges.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds like fun! What made you decide to design a puzzle game?<p class="message sent message-content">Well, I love puzzles myself and think they're a great way to exercise your brain while having fun.<p class="message received message-content">I totally agree. So, what's the premise of the game?<p class="message sent message-content">The idea is to solve a series of complex puzzles and earn points to unlock the next level. Each level will be more challenging than the last.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds like a good challenge. Will there be any bonuses or power-ups to help players along the way?<p class="message sent message-content">Of course! I've included a few secret bonuses that will really up the player's score if they can find them.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds intriguing. Will the game have a storyline?<p class="message sent message-content">It won't have a traditional storyline, but there will be a theme tying the puzzles together. I don't want to give too much away, though!<p class="message received message-content">Fair enough. When do you think it will be ready for release?<p class="message sent message-content">Hopefully in a few months. There's a lot to do, but I'm excited to share it with the world!<p class="message received message-content">I can't wait to try it out. Do you need any beta testers?<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely! I would love some feedback before the official launch. I'll send you a beta version once it's ready.<p class="message received message-content">Awesome, thanks B! I'm really looking forward to it.<p class="message sent message-content">My pleasure, A. I hope you have fun playing it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0807ad7a-3355-44ce-a458-a5b21ae01e51.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
