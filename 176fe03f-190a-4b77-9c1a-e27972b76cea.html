Nice to work with you again.<p class="message sent">Yeah, good to see you too, A. Ready to get our noodle making on?<p class=message>Absolutely. So, what's our plan for today's special?<p class="message sent">I was thinking we could make a spicy seafood udon noodle soup. How does that sound to you?<p class=message>That sounds great. What kind of seafood were you thinking of using?<p class="message sent">Well, we have some fresh shrimp and squid that we could use. And for the soup base, I'll use a combination of miso and gochujang.<p class=message>Perfect. I'll start on the noodle dough while you work on the soup. Do you have any special requests for the dough?<p class="message sent">Just make sure it's nice and elastic, but not too chewy. Oh, and maybe add some spinach for a pop of color.<p class=message>Got it. I'll add that in. So, I saw on your Instagram that you went on a hiking trip last weekend. How was it?<p class="message sent">It was amazing! We hiked up a mountain and had a gorgeous view of the city. I even picked some wild mushrooms along the way.<p class=message>That sounds like a fun adventure. Did you get to cook with the mushrooms?<p class="message sent">Yes, I made a delicious mushroom risotto with them. It was heavenly.<p class=message>Wow, I'm impressed. I bet it was better than any restaurant risotto.<p class="message sent">Haha, thank you. I do love cooking in my free time too. Speaking of free time, any plans for the weekend ahead?<p class=message>Nothing too exciting. I might catch up on some Netflix and try out some new baking recipes.<p class="message sent">Sounds relaxing. Well, the noodles are ready to be cut and boiled. Shall we start assembling the dish?<p class=message>Let's do it. I can't wait to try our creation.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=176fdf96-fd12-4787-9034-a5f2f89b7b30.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
