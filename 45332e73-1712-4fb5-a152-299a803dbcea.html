How's your day been so far, B?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. It's been pretty good. Can't complain. How about yours?<p class=message>Good as well. Just excited to explore Marseille. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, many times actually. It's a beautiful city with great food and culture.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've been looking forward to trying the seafood and visiting the old port.<p class="message sent">You're in for a treat. Make sure to visit the Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde too. The view is amazing!<p class=message>Oh, thanks for the recommendation. I'll definitely check it out. Do you have any favorite spots in Marseille?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love the Palais Longchamp and the Calanques. It's a bit of a hike to get there, but it's worth it.<p class=message>Sounds like it. How long have you been driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for over 10 years now. It's a great way to meet people and hear their stories.<p class=message>That's true. Do you have any interesting stories you'd like to share?<p class="message sent">One time, I gave a ride to a famous celebrity. He was really nice and tipped me really well.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like an unforgettable experience! Who was the celebrity, if you don't mind me asking?<p class="message sent">Sorry, I can't disclose that information. Privacy is important when you're a taxi driver.<p class=message>No problem, I understand. Thanks for the fun conversation and the tips on Marseille, B. Have a good day!<p class="message sent">You too, A. Have a great time in Marseille and take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=45300b9a-5e3a-42b0-b304-93c2b34ab314.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
