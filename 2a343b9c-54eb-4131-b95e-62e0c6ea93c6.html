I've been baking for years, but I'm always open to learning new techniques.<p class="message sent">Welcome to our sweet little spot in Barcelona! What kind of pastries are you interested in making today?<p class=message>I've always loved churros, so I was hoping we could start there.<p class="message sent">Great choice! Churros are a quintessential Spanish dessert that is as delicious as it is simple to make. First, we'll need to heat up the oil for frying.<p class=message>How hot does it need to be?<p class="message sent">You'll want to get it to about 375Â°F. While it's heating up, we'll whisk together a dough made from flour, water, and sugar.<p class=message>That sounds easy enough. Is there any secret to getting the dough to the right consistency?<p class="message sent">Yes, you'll want to make sure the dough is smooth and silky. Sift your flour before mixing it, and add the water slowly while whisking constantly.<p class=message>Got it! What's next?<p class="message sent">We'll pipe the dough into strips and fry them until they're golden brown. After they're done, we'll dust them with cinnamon sugar and enjoy!<p class=message>Mmm, my mouth is watering already. What other desserts are popular in Spain?<p class="message sent">Tarta de Santiago is a traditional Spanish almond cake that's always a crowd pleaser. And you can't forget about flan!<p class=message>Flan is one of my favorites. Can we make that next?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We'll need eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla extract. It's a bit tricky to perfect, but with a little patience, we'll have a silky smooth custard that's to die for.<p class=message>I'm up for the challenge! This is so much fun. I can't wait to add Spanish pastries to my baking repertoire.<p class="message sent">It's always great to learn new skills! And what better way to do so than by making (and eating) delicious desserts?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a313e34-90c5-4dcc-bf43-d0472217110b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
