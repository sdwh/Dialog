How's your day going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing alright. Just heading to Nanjing for a conference.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting. What's the conference about?<p class=message>It's a business conference. But to be honest, I'm more excited about trying the traditional Nanjing duck dish.<p class="message sent">Ah, Nanjing duck! It's pretty famous. Have you had it before?<p class=message>No, this will be my first time trying it! I've heard it's delicious.<p class="message sent">Yes, it definitely is. I might have to ask for a few recommendations myself.<p class=message>Haha, feel free to ask me. I did some research beforehand.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate it. By the way, have you been to Nanjing before?<p class=message>No, it's my first time visiting. But I've heard so many amazing things about the city.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. It's a beautiful city with lots of history.<p class=message>I'm looking forward to seeing some of the historical sites, like the Ming Dynasty City Wall and the Confucius Temple.<p class="message sent">Those are great choices. You'll also have to check out the Presidential Palace and the Qinhuai River at night.<p class=message>I definitely will. This trip is going to be packed with so many things to see and do!<p class="message sent">Sounds like it'll be a great adventure. Is there anything else you're particularly excited about?<p class=message>Well, I'm also hoping to try some of the local street food stalls. I've heard they have some amazing snacks, especially around the Fuzi Miao area.<p class="message sent">You're making me hungry just talking about it! I hope you have a great time in Nanjing, and don't forget to try some of the amazing local cuisine.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=551cbf2d-1f1c-437d-992f-de5958ccd663.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
