How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Oh, hello Nurse. I've been better but I cannot complain.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I'm here to check your vitals and make sure everything is okay.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Go ahead, poke and prod like usual.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, I'll try to be gentle. So, have you been keeping up with your exercises?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's tough but I know it's necessary.<p class=message>Yes, it is. It's important to stay active, especially now that you're recovering.<p class="message sent">Speaking of recovery, when can I go back to eating my favorite foods?<p class=message>(smiling) I know how much you love your pizza. Soon enough, Mr. B, soon enough.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Thank you, Nurse. You always manage to make this place a little less miserable.<p class=message>Aww, that's so sweet of you to say. It's all part of the job, though.<p class="message sent">You do your job well, that's for sure. So, have you heard the latest joke going around the hospital?<p class=message>(curious) No, I haven't. Do tell.<p class="message sent">Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? Because it was two-tired!<p class=message>(laughs) That's a good one. You never fail to brighten my day, Mr. B.<p class="message sent">(smiling) I try my best. So, do you have any favorite jokes?<p class=message>Hmm, let me think. How about this one: What did the grape say when it got stepped on? Nothing, it just let out a little wine.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I like that one. You definitely have a talent for telling jokes.<p class=message>Thanks, I'll keep them coming. Now, let me finish up checking your vitals and then you can take a nap.<p class="message sent">Okay, sounds like a plan. Thanks for being such a great nurse, Nurse A.<p class=message>(smiling) It's my pleasure, Mr. B.
