How about a comedy?<p class=message>Sounds good. Let me check Netflix.<p class="message sent">Have you seen the new show "The Good Place"?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it good?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's hilarious. It's about a woman who accidentally ends up in heaven.<p class=message>Alright, let's give it a try. *presses play*<p class="message sent">*giggling* This is hilarious.
