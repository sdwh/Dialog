It's looking good so far!<p class=message>That's great to hear! Did you have any trouble navigating through the app?<p class="message sent">No, everything seemed pretty intuitive. But I did notice a little bug in the user profile section.<p class=message>Oh no, we definitely don't want any bugs lingering around. Did you report it to the rest of the team?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I submitted a ticket with the details. Hopefully, it'll get fixed soon.<p class=message>Nice work, B! Speaking of bugs, have you seen any of those creepy crawlies around the office lately?<p class="message sent">(laughs) No, I haven't. But if I do, I'll make sure to let you know. Maybe we can put our coding skills to use and create a bug-catching app!<p class=message>(laughs) That would be quite the unexpected project! Speaking of unexpected, did you catch that new Netflix show everyone's been talking about?<p class="message sent">Which one? There are so many to choose from!<p class=message>The one about the robot rebellion. I heard it's pretty intense.<p class="message sent">Ah, you mean "Reboot Rampage." Yeah, I started watching it, but I couldn't get past the cheesy graphics.<p class=message>Yeah, I know what you mean. But the storyline was pretty captivating, in my opinion.<p class="message sent">Maybe I'll give it another try, then. But first, we've got some coding to do!<p class=message>Yes, let's dive back in. Thanks for chatting, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=13fedd3e-6083-4eb0-82ad-86199d1288b2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
