We’re trying to figure out how to prevent our developments from harming the fishing industry.<p class=message>That’s great!

But remember, our cooperative efforts should involve meaningful and constructive discussions among key stakeholders to achieve our shared goals.<p class="message sent">You’re right, engaging with the fishing industry is a critical part of our planning process. We should ensure that everyone's needs and concerns are taken into account.<p class=message>I agree. It’s always better to work together towards solutions. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me about this.<p class="message sent">Of course, community collaboration is essential to the success of our marine energy projects.
