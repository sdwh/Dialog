Traffic can be a pain, but I always find a way to get my passengers to their destination on time.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, have you had any interesting passengers lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. Just yesterday, I had a passenger who was so engrossed in a book that he didn't even notice he had reached his destination.<p class=message>(laughs) That's funny. Speaking of books, have you read anything interesting lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I just finished a mystery novel. It had me guessing until the very end.<p class=message>I love mystery novels too. What's your favorite one?<p class="message sent">My all-time favorite is "The Maltese Falcon" by Dashiell Hammett. It's a classic.<p class=message>I've heard of that one, but I haven't read it yet. I'll have to add it to my reading list.<p class="message sent">Definitely worth the read. So, what brings you to Taipei today?<p class=message>I'm meeting some friends for brunch at a restaurant in Da'an district.<p class="message sent">Ah, Da'an is a nice area. There are some great restaurants there.<p class=message>Yes, I'm excited to try this place. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But if it's in Da'an district, it's sure to be excellent.<p class=message>That's what I'm hoping! So, do you have any plans for the rest of the day?<p class="message sent">Just work, but I enjoy driving so it's no problem.<p class=message>Well, I appreciate you driving me to my destination. Thanks for the great conversation too!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. It was my pleasure. Enjoy your brunch!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e9427a89-08ef-4724-ac20-d67186141768.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
