It's great to see you again. So, what brings us here today?<p class="message sent">Hi A! We're here to talk about how we can ensure the security of our clients' financial information.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. We've been having a lot of online security breaches these days. What do you suggest we do to prevent these?<p class="message sent">Well, as a network security engineer, I suggest we use the latest encryption technology to secure our clients' data.<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea, but since I'm a cloud infrastructure engineer, I think we should also have a robust disaster recovery plan in place.<p class="message sent">Absolutely right! We can't afford to take any risks when it comes to the security of our clients' financial data.<p class=message>Speaking of risks, have you heard about the recent ATM fraud incidents happening around the city?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's pretty scary. We should definitely tighten our security measures to prevent such frauds from happening.<p class=message>That's true. We could also consider educating our clients about safe online practices like not sharing their passwords with anyone.<p class="message sent">I totally agree. We can conduct regular client awareness programs to keep them informed about the latest security threats and best practices.<p class=message>It's great to work with someone who takes cybersecurity seriously and thinks outside the box.<p class="message sent">Likewise. With a well-coordinated effort, I'm sure we can keep our clients' financial data safe and secure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=454de211-c2b7-4443-aa1a-b6377c10ae99.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
