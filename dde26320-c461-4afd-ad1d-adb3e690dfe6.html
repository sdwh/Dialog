Nice to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Hi, A. I'm the chef who will be teaching you the traditional seafood recipes. I'm excited to have you here.<p class=message>Thank you for having me. I've been fishing for years, but I'm always eager to learn new cooking techniques.<p class="message sent">Great attitude! So, let's start with the basics. Can you tell me about the fish you caught today?<p class=message>Sure thing. We've got some lobsters, shrimps, and scallops. They're fresh and ready to be cooked.<p class="message sent">Excellent choices. Let's start by preparing the lobsters. Do you know how to remove the meat from the shell?<p class=message>I'm afraid not. I usually just sell them off to the local restaurants.<p class="message sent">No worries. I'll teach you how to do it properly. And once we're done with the lobsters, we can move to the shrimps.<p class=message>Sounds good. I'm excited to learn.<p class="message sent">That's a good mindset to have. You know, I can tell you're passionate about fishing. What's your favorite fish to catch?<p class=message>Hmm, tough question. I'd say the bluefin tuna. It's a challenging catch, but it's worth it.<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. The bluefin tuna is a delicacy that's highly sought after. Maybe we can incorporate it into one of our dishes in the future.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I'd love to learn more about that.<p class="message sent">It's settled then. For now, let's focus on perfecting these traditional recipes.<p class=message>Agreed. I can't wait to see what we can cook up together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ddddd237-2b73-41ba-b887-d824fb9477c9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
