I had no idea I could swerve like that.<p class=message>Yeah, I was trying to avoid getting wet, but it was impossible.<p class="message sent">I think getting wet was half the fun. Did you manage to bump into anyone?<p class=message>Actually, I did, but I couldn’t tell who it was since we were all wearing helmets.<p class="message sent">Haha, that’s the best part. It’s like a mystery game of who you’re hitting.<p class=message>I was surprised at how fast these boats could go. I didn’t expect it to be so exciting.<p class="message sent">Same here. I thought it’d be a slow ride around the pond, but it turned out to be a wild adventure.<p class=message>I’m glad we tried it out. Have you ever done any other crazy rides like this before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I’ve been on a few roller coasters, but this one was definitely unique.<p class=message>It’s a good thing we’re not too old for these types of rides yet, haha.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It’s nice to take a break from the serious stuff and just let loose for a bit.<p class=message>Couldn’t agree more. This trip has been a blast so far.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Let’s see what other adventures this amusement park has in store for us.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a81aa70-84d4-4c54-b647-af3a735a8bc3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
