What can I do for you today?<p class="message received message-content">I need to go to the airport. I'm off to Miami for a vacation.<p class="message sent message-content">Great! Miami's a fun place. You'll have a blast.<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, I can't wait to soak up the sun and hit up the beach.<p class="message sent message-content">You're definitely in the right place for that. It's been hot and sunny all week.<p class="message received message-content">Do you have any recommendations on where I should go to get some good food?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, definitely hit up Joe's Stone Crab Restaurant. They've been around for over 100 years and serve up some of the best seafood in the city.<p class="message received message-content">Wow, that sounds amazing! I'll have to check it out.<p class="message sent message-content">You should also visit Little Havana.

I'll add it to my list of places to go.<p class="message sent message-content">No problem at all. Have you been to Miami before?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, a few times actually. But it's been a few years since I've been back.<p class="message sent message-content">Well, you'll be happy to know that the city has changed quite a bit over the years. There's always something new and exciting to check out.<p class="message received message-content">That's great to hear.
