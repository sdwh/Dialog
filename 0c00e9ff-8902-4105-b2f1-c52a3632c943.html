What can I do for you today?<p class=message>I need to go to the airport. I'm off to Miami for a vacation.<p class="message sent">Great! Miami's a fun place. You'll have a blast.<p class=message>Yeah, I can't wait to soak up the sun and hit up the beach.<p class="message sent">You're definitely in the right place for that. It's been hot and sunny all week.<p class=message>Do you have any recommendations on where I should go to get some good food?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely hit up Joe's Stone Crab Restaurant. They've been around for over 100 years and serve up some of the best seafood in the city.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing! I'll have to check it out.<p class="message sent">You should also visit Little Havana. It's a vibrant neighborhood filled with Cuban culture and great food.<p class=message>Thanks for the tip. I'll add it to my list of places to go.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Have you been to Miami before?<p class=message>Yes, a few times actually. But it's been a few years since I've been back.<p class="message sent">Well, you'll be happy to know that the city has changed quite a bit over the years. There's always something new and exciting to check out.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm excited to see what's new.<p class="message sent">Just remember to stay hydrated, wear lots of sunscreen, and have fun!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0bfab57f-8ae4-46ed-b03f-9a0c9db0ceef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
