It's a beautiful day for a seafood cooking class, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! I'm excited to teach you some traditional recipes from this area.<p class=message>I can't wait to learn! I've been fishing for years, but I could always improve my cooking skills.<p class="message sent">Well, you've come to the right place. Our local cuisine is all about fresh seafood and simple preparations.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. What's on the menu for today?<p class="message sent">We're going to make a classic seafood chowder and grilled scallops with garlic butter.<p class=message>Yum! I've never made chowder before, but I love to eat it.<p class="message sent">It's not too difficult, just cook the potatoes and seafood in milk and cream and add some herbs. For the scallops, we'll marinate them in a mixture of garlic, butter and lemon juice.<p class=message>That sounds easy enough. Can we get started?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Follow me to the kitchen and we'll start prepping our ingredients.<p class=message>Wow, look at all these fresh seafood options. I can't decide what to pick!<p class="message sent">Don't worry, we'll use a variety of seafood in the chowder, including clams, mussels and shrimp.<p class=message>This smells amazing already. I can't wait to taste it.<p class="message sent">Me too! Let's get cooking and experience the delicious flavors of Tasmanian seafood firsthand.<p class=message>Thank you for teaching me these recipes, Chef. I feel much more confident in my seafood cooking skills now.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, it was my pleasure. And anytime you're in the area and want to try new recipes, I'm here to help!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1c8c47b5-1639-4062-848b-c0bcf162494b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
