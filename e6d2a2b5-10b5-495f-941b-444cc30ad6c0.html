How's everything going in the kitchen?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Everything is fine, thank you. The kitchen team is preparing for another busy day.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Have you tried the new dish we added to the menu?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's delicious and our customers seem to love it too.<p class=message>Perfect! I was thinking about adding a weekly special. Any suggestions?<p class="message sent">How about we do a seafood night? We can showcase different seafood dishes every week.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. I'll talk to the front of house team to see if we can promote it.<p class="message sent">While we're on the topic of promotions, have we promoted our vegan options enough?<p class=message>That's a good point. I'll make sure to include our vegan options on our social media channels and website.<p class="message sent">Speaking of vegan options, I think we should also include a vegan dessert on our menu.<p class=message>Agreed. Let me talk to our pastry chef and see if we can come up with something.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. On a different note, how was the training session with the new chefs yesterday?<p class=message>It went well. They seem to be fitting in nicely with our team.<p class="message sent">That's great news. We need all hands on deck for the upcoming events we have scheduled.<p class=message>Yes, we have a few private events this week. I'll make sure they're prepared for anything.<p class="message sent">Perfect. I have a meeting with the suppliers this afternoon, so I'll make sure we have everything we need for the week.<p class=message>Thanks, B. You're a great kitchen manager.<p class="message sent">And you're a great restaurant manager, A. Let's keep up the good work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e6d25818-2f51-4de9-bfd7-8097bb077fb6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
