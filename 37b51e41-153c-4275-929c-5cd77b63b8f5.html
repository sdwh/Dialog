How was the workshop today?<p class="message sent">Oh, it was great! We learned how to make Okinawan shaved ice and Goya champuru.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds delicious. Did you try them?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. The shaved ice was so refreshing with its unique flavors, and the champuru had a bit of bitterness in it, which was balanced by the other ingredients.<p class=message>That's wonderful. Our customers will love them. Do we have all the necessary ingredients to make them in our restaurant?<p class="message sent">Yes, we should be able to find all the ingredients. I'll make a list and we can check them out in the market tomorrow.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. By the way, did you learn anything new about making cocktails?<p class="message sent">Yes, we learned how to make the famous Okinawan cocktail, Shikuwasa sour. It's made with the local citrus fruit shikuwasa, which has a tangy flavor.<p class=message>That's impressive. We can add it to our menu as a signature cocktail. What else did you learn?<p class="message sent">We also learned about the importance of presentation in making drinks. It's not just about the taste, but also how it looks.<p class=message>I totally agree. Our customers eat with their eyes first, as they always say. So, did you take any photos of our workshop?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I'll send them to you later.<p class=message>Awesome. I can't wait to see them. Thank you for attending the workshop and bringing back all the valuable knowledge.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It was a great experience learning about the local cuisine and drinks. I can't wait to showcase our new creations to our customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=37b2f551-9be0-4bf5-8e02-b6aa7e73fd4e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
