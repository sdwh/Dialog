Which airline did you arrive on?<p class=message>I flew in from Miami on American Airlines.<p class="message sent">Okay, you'll want to head towards baggage claim area number four. It should be pretty easy to find from here.<p class=message>Thank you so much! I wasn't sure if I needed to go through customs still or not.<p class="message sent">Nope, since you're coming from a domestic flight, you won't have to go through any additional screenings.<p class=message>That's great to hear. How long does it typically take for the baggage to come out?<p class="message sent">It really depends on how busy the airport is and how quickly the baggage handlers are able to unload the plane. But typically, you should expect your luggage to arrive within 20-30 minutes of landing.<p class=message>Gotcha. Looks like I've got a little bit of time to kill then!<p class="message sent">Yeah, the great thing about this airport is that there's plenty to see and do while you're waiting for your bags. Did you know there's a museum exhibit just around the corner from here?<p class=message>No, I had no idea!<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's really interesting. They have exhibits on the history of aviation and even an interactive flight simulator. You should definitely check it out!<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestion. I think I'll go explore a little bit while I'm waiting.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. And if you have any more questions or need any more help, just let me know. I'm here to make your experience as smooth as possible.<p class=message>Awesome, thank you so much!<p class="message sent">No problem, enjoy your stay here in our city!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cdf619c6-33a2-49e1-8a59-8ea140d484f9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
