Have you planned your trip yet?<p class="message sent">Not really, I have heard that there are a lot of things to do there.<p class=message>Definitely. I suggest you start with visiting the Great Barrier Reef. It's breathtaking.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Do you have any other recommendations?<p class=message>Well, you can also visit Daintree Rainforest and do some hiking there.<p class="message sent">Hiking sounds great, but what else?<p class=message>I think you should also check out Kuranda Village. It's a cute little town with lots of unique shops and restaurants.<p class="message sent">That does sound like a good place to relax. Any more suggestions?<p class=message>Yeah, if you have time, visit the Atherton Tablelands. It's a beautiful and unique landscape.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a really full itinerary. Do you think we should get a rental car?<p class=message>I definitely recommend it. It will give you the freedom to explore all these places on your own schedule.<p class="message sent">Good point. How many days do you think we need there?<p class=message>I think you should plan for at least 5-7 days to really see and experience everything.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for your recommendations!<p class=message>No problem. Have a great trip and take lots of pictures!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=852dc13e-c725-4686-85fc-c65d0ff16d6f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
