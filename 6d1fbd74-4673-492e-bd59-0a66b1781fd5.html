We had a science experiment in class.<p class=message>That sounds fun. What did you do?<p class="message sent">We were testing the acidity of different liquids.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds interesting! Did you make any discoveries?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we found out that orange juice is more acidic than lemon juice.<p class=message>That's great! Maybe next time you can test the acidity of some condiments we have at home.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that would be cool. Oh, Dad, did you hear about the new pizza place that opened up in town?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">I don't know, but they have a pizza that has hot dogs on the crust.<p class=message>Hot dogs on the crust?! That sounds... interesting.<p class=message>Speaking of interesting food, did you know that in some countries, people eat bugs?<p class="message sent">Gross! I can't even imagine eating a bug.<p class=message>Well, some people say they are a good source of protein.<p class="message sent">I'll stick to my chicken and veggies, thank you very much.<p class=message>Agreed. So, what do you want to order for dinner tonight?<p class="message sent">Can we get the chicken Alfredo and a side of garlic bread?<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let's also get some salad to balance it out.<p class="message sent">Okay, Mom. Can we get ranch dressing for the salad?<p class=message>Of course, B. And maybe we can even make our own homemade ranch dressing one day.<p class="message sent">That would be fun! Maybe we can experiment with different spices and see what we like best.<p class=message>Definitely. Speaking of experiments, do you have any science projects coming up at school, B?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we have to build a bridge and test how much weight it can hold.<p class=message>That sounds like a fun challenge. Maybe Dad can help you build it.<p class=message>Absolutely, I'd be happy to help. And who knows, maybe we'll even get inspired to build a real-life bridge one day.<p class="message sent">That would be so cool! Your ideas are always so creative, Dad.<p class=message>Aw, thank you, B. I'm glad you think so.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6d1cb4ff-e768-4db1-b294-8c45fa080cb7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
