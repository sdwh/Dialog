Can we start by confirming your name and address?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Officer. My name is Jack Johnson, and I live at 123 Main Street.<p class=message>Thank you, Jack. Can you tell me where you were on the night of the robbery?<p class="message sent">Well, Officer, I was at home all night. I watched some TV and then went to bed. I didn't know anything about the robbery until you guys arrested me.<p class=message>I see. We have some witnesses who claim they saw you at the scene of the crime. Can you explain that?<p class="message sent">That's impossible, Officer. I was at home all night. Besides, I don't even know where the robbery took place.<p class=message>Hmm, I find that hard to believe, Jack. Do you have any alibi or witnesses who can confirm you were at home?<p class="message sent">Yes, my girlfriend was with me all night. You can ask her.<p class=message>Okay, we'll look into that. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to tell us?<p class="message sent">Just that I'm innocent, Officer. I didn't do it.<p class=message>Well, we'll continue our investigation, and hopefully, we can clear this up soon. Thanks, Jack, for your cooperation.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Officer.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=963ee1cc-6e85-4cc3-a65e-092d20b6cff5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
