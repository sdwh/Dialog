I went to the beach and enjoyed some fresh seafood. How about you, sir?<p class=message>Oh, I just stayed home and caught up on some reading. Speaking of reading, let's talk about a new word today - Ambivalent. Have you heard of it?<p class="message sent">Nope. What does it mean, sir?<p class=message>Ambivalent is when you have mixed feelings or emotions about something. You can't decide if you like it or not. It's like being undecided.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. So, like when I can't decide between pizza or pasta for dinner, I am ambivalent.<p class=message>That's right, B! Now you've got the hang of it. Can you give me an example of a situation in which you might feel ambivalent?<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe when I have to choose between studying for a test or hanging out with my friends.<p class=message>Yes, that's a great example! It's not easy to choose between two important things.<p class="message sent">I understand now. Thanks for explaining it so well, sir.<p class=message>No problem, B. Remember, it's important to expand your vocabulary and learn new words every day. You never know when you might need to use them.<p class="message sent">I will definitely keep that in mind, sir.<p class=message>Good work today, B. Keep up the good work and have a great day ahead!<p class="message sent">Thanks, sir. You too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1a79fd46-c821-4bc2-bfb4-c3afd35e50c8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
