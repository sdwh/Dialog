How's the frontend coming along?<p class=message>It's been a bit of a challenge, but I think we're getting there. By the way, have you tried that new Thai restaurant down the street yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class=message>Yeah, I went there last week with some friends and it was delicious. We should check it out together.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. But first, do you need any help with the UI design? I noticed that the font size was a bit too small.<p class=message>Actually, that would be great. Do you have any suggestions for a better font size?<p class="message sent">I did some research and found that a font size of 16px is the most readable for web content. We can try that and see how it looks.<p class=message>Okay, let's give it a shot. Thanks for your help.<p class="message sent">No problem. Hey, did you hear about that new programming language that's been gaining popularity?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class="message sent">It's called Rust. It's designed for safe and concurrent programming, and it's supposed to have excellent performance.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. We should take a look at it sometime.<p class="message sent">Definitely. But for now, let's focus on getting this system up and running. We're in the home stretch.<p class=message>Agreed. And after we finish, we can celebrate with some delicious Thai food.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I can't wait.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7b8f0beb-301d-4d7e-bc7c-feddd8ccfad3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
