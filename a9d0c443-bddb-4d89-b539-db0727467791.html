Thanks for coming to our farm today for the check-up.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Mr. A! It's my pleasure to be here. So, which animals do we need to examine today?<p class=message>Well, we have a couple of cows, a few goats, and our prized bull.<p class="message sent">Excellent. I'll start with the cows. How have they been doing lately?<p class=message>They've been producing plenty of milk and seem to be in good spirits, but one of them has a bit of a cough.<p class="message sent">That's something we can take care of. Now, let's move on to the goats. How are they?<p class=message>They're doing well, but one of them has a slight limp. And we're trying to breed a couple of them, but it hasn't been successful yet.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'll give them a thorough check-up and see what we can do to improve their chances.<p class=message>Sounds great. And last but not least, our bull. He's the king of the farm.<p class="message sent">I can see why. He's a magnificent creature. How has he been lately?<p class=message>He's been good overall, but he's been a bit aggressive towards the other animals.<p class="message sent">Ah, that could be a sign of territorial behavior. I'll check him over and recommend some solutions.<p class=message>Thank you so much, Dr. B. You're a lifesaver.<p class="message sent">It's all part of the job. And remember, healthy animals mean a healthy farm.<p class=message>We'll keep that in mind. Thanks again!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a9ce9608-f0aa-4b4f-8a6b-4c158950c752.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
