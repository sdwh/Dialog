What kind of noodles are you planning to pair with it?<p class="message sent">I was thinking the fresh udon noodles we made this morning, they'll soak up the broth nicely.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds delicious. What other ingredients should we add?<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking some green onions, bean sprouts, and maybe some sliced pork belly.<p class=message>Mmm, my mouth is already watering. Do you have any new ideas for specials this week?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was thinking of experimenting with a fusion dish, maybe adding some kimchi to our ramen and see how it turns out.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Let's give it a try and see what customers think. Speaking of customers, we've had a lot of tourists lately, how do you feel about their taste preferences?<p class="message sent">I think it's great to have a mix of cultures trying our food. It also inspires me to experiment and try new things. How about you?<p class=message>Same here, it's always exciting to hear feedback and try to cater to their preferences. But at the end of the day, we want to maintain the authenticity of our Korean flavors.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, and I think our customers appreciate that. Plus, the fact that we make our noodles and broth from scratch really sets us apart.<p class=message>Definitely. And speaking of keeping it authentic, have you had a chance to try any new Korean dishes outside of work?<p class="message sent">Actually, I tried Makgeolli for the first time last weekend. Have you had it before?<p class=message>Yes, it's a great drink to have with Korean barbecue. Did you like it?<p class="message sent">I have to admit, it wasn't my favorite at first, but it grew on me after a few sips.<p class=message>That's how it usually goes! Well, let's get back to perfecting this noodle recipe. Our customers are in for a treat tonight!<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6abdb7b5-f66c-4fe5-8622-084ace4dedda.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
