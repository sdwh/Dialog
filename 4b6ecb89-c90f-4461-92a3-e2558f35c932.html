I'm a food critic and I've been looking forward to trying some of the best street food here in Guangzhou. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Welcome to Guangzhou! You must try our famous Shui Kao or grilled skewers. They are especially popular here on this street.<p class=message>Sounds great! I'll definitely give it a try. How about something sweet for dessert?<p class="message sent">Ah, our Egg Tarts here are very popular! They are flaky and creamy; you'll definitely love them!<p class=message>Mmm, they look delicious! What about that big pot of soup I see over there? What is it?<p class="message sent">That's our traditional Cantonese soup, Sam Guk Juk. It's made with pork, fish, and tripe. Very nutritious and filling!<p class=message>I think I'll have to save that for later. I don't want to get full too quickly! What's that dish over there that's cooking in a wok?<p class="message sent">That's our famous stir-fry. We use fresh vegetables and your choice of meat, all cooked to perfection in our special sauce.<p class=message>Oh wow! That looks amazing! There are so many dishes to choose from, I can't decide what to order!<p class="message sent">Don't worry, we have a sampler platter that you can try. It has a little bit of everything so you can taste everything in one dish.<p class=message>Brilliant! That's a great idea. And how about a drink to wash it all down?<p class="message sent">May I suggest you our locally made pearl milk tea? It's creamy, sweet, and with a nice texture. You'll love it!<p class=message>That sounds perfect! You are a gem, thank you for your recommendations. I'm excited to try everything!<p class="message sent">We take pride in our food here, we hope you enjoy every bit of it. Bon appetit!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4b6a9696-4de4-4751-ae07-d348911f9172.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
