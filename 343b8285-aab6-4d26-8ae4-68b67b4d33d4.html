How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hello, Nurse A. I'm feeling a bit better, thank you. How are you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thank you! Did you sleep well last night?<p class="message sent">I did, thanks for asking. But the mattress here is not as comfortable as mine at home.<p class=message>I understand. But did you know that hospitals have come a long way in terms of patient comfort? We have special therapeutic mattresses that prevent bedsores.<p class="message sent">Really? That's interesting. Can I try one?<p class=message>Of course! I'll arrange it for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Nurse A. You're always so helpful.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. And speaking of comfort, have you tried our hospital food yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's not bad, but I miss my wife's cooking.<p class=message>I can imagine. But did you know that some hospital food has actually won awards?<p class="message sent">No way. What kind of awards?<p class=message>The HCAHPS Best Practices Award for Patient Satisfaction. Our hospital has won it for three years in a row.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. Maybe I should give it another chance.<p class=message>Definitely! And while you're at it, why not try the Jell-O? It's a patient favorite.<p class="message sent">Ha! Alright, I'll give it a shot.<p class=message>Great! And don't forget your morning exercises. It's important for your recovery.<p class="message sent">Oh, do I have to?<p class=message>Yes, you do. But I'll make it more fun for you. We can put on some music and dance while you exercise.<p class="message sent">Alright, you've convinced me. Let's do it.<p class=message>That's the spirit, B! Alright, let me put on some music and we'll get moving.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=343b30f7-3a6e-45f5-b53b-dee0dc062834.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
