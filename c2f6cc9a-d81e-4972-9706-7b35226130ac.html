Thanks for agreeing to this interview.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, happy to be here.<p class=message>So, first things first, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?<p class="message sent">Sure. I'm a graphic designer and I run my own company.<p class=message>That's really impressive! What made you want to get into graphic design?<p class="message sent">I've always been interested in art and design. When I was younger, I used to draw all the time. As I got older, I started to explore graphic design as a way to take my skills to the next level.<p class=message>That's really cool. What do you think sets your work apart from other graphic designers?<p class="message sent">I think I bring a really unique perspective to my work. I'm always looking for new and interesting ways to approach each project. Plus, I'm pretty quick on my feet!<p class=message>That's definitely a valuable skill to have. So, do you have any exciting projects in the works at the moment?<p class="message sent">Yeah, actually. I'm working with a big new client on a branding project. It's going to be a lot of work, but I'm really excited to get started.<p class=message>That sounds like a fantastic opportunity. So, switching gears a little bit, have you tried the coffee here before?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I come here all the time. The coffee is really good.<p class=message>I definitely agree. Do you have a go-to drink?<p class="message sent">Usually just a plain latte. I'm pretty boring when it comes to coffee, to be honest.<p class=message>Hey, no judgment here. Sometimes keeping it simple is the way to go.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Plus, then I can focus on my work instead of deciding what type of coffee to get.<p class=message>Ha, fair enough. Well it's been really great chatting with you. Thanks for taking the time to talk with us today.<p class="message sent">Of course, thanks for having me!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c2f56932-2134-42b7-8a43-b4df85d35a4f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
