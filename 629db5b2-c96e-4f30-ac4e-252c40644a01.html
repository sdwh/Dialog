It's a security standard that helps organizations develop a strong cybersecurity framework.<p class=message>Exactly! I was wondering if you knew anything about intrusion detection systems.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've worked with them before. They're a vital component of any cybersecurity system.<p class=message>Cool! Can you give me a brief overview of how it works?<p class="message sent">Sure. IDS analyzes and monitors network traffic for any irregularities or suspicious activities.<p class=message>Okay, that makes sense. Is there anything else that we should know?<p class="message sent">IDS can alert security teams in real-time if there is a threat and they can take action to mitigate the attack.<p class=message>Got it. Is it expensive to implement IDS in a company's cybersecurity system?<p class="message sent">It can be, but it's definitely worth the investment to ensure the safety of sensitive data and networks.<p class=message>I agree. I guess it's better to be safe than sorry.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And with ISO 27001, organizations can ensure that their cybersecurity framework is up to par with industry standards.<p class=message>Wow, I'm really learning a lot from this conversation.<p class="message sent">I'm glad I could help! Do you have any other cybersecurity questions?<p class=message>Not at the moment, but I'll definitely keep you in mind if I do.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. It's always better to address and mitigate cybersecurity concerns sooner rather than later.<p class=message>I completely agree. Thanks for chatting with me about this!<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=629933d9-4c1d-4e71-b38a-fed103416683.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
