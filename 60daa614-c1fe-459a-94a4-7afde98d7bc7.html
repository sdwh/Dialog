How's everything going in the pastry kitchen today?<p class="message sent">Hi there, A! All is well, thank you. Just finished up a few new desserts for the case.<p class=message>That's great to hear! I have a feeling they're going to pair perfectly with our coffees today.<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. Speaking of which, have you tried our new roast? It's a single origin from Ethiopia.<p class=message>I have! I love how it has notes of blueberry and chocolate. It really brings out the flavors in my espresso shots.<p class="message sent">That's exactly why I picked it for our Tiramisu. It's going to be a real treat!<p class=message>I'm excited to try it. And speaking of treats, did you happen to save any of that raspberry tart for me?<p class="message sent">Only if you make me a cappuccino first.<p class=message>Deal! I'll make it extra foamy for you.<p class="message sent">Perfect. I'll go grab the tart while you're at it.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. By the way, have we noticed any new faces in the shop recently?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. There's been a lot of foot traffic lately. It's great to see so many people enjoying our delicious offerings.<p class=message>Agreed. It's moments like these that make me really appreciate working in this industry.<p class="message sent">Same here. We get to make people happy every day, one cup of coffee and slice of cake at a time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=60d9b044-b860-4b04-a448-2743dfb422d4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
