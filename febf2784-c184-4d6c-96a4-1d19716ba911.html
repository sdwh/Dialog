Where would you like to go today?<p class=message>I'm heading to Seoul for a weekend getaway. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's a beautiful city with lots of things to do. Do you have any plans for your stay?<p class=message>I'm planning to visit the historic palaces and try some delicious Korean food. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">You should definitely try some bibimbap and kimchi! They're traditional Korean dishes that you're sure to enjoy. Have you tried Korean food before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I really like bulgogi and japchae. Do you have a favorite Korean dish?<p class="message sent">I would say my favorite dish is tteokbokki. It's a spicy rice cake dish that's very popular in Korea. Have you tried it before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. I'll have to give it a try while I'm there. How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been a taxi driver for about 10 years now. It can be tough, but I really enjoy meeting new people and helping them get to their destination.<p class=message>That's great. Do you have any funny or interesting stories from your time as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Well, I once had a passenger who left their dog in the backseat of my taxi! It was a little chihuahua that had been sleeping the whole ride. They came back within a few minutes to get it, but it was definitely a surprise.<p class=message>Wow, that's quite a story. Thanks for sharing. We're almost to the airport now. How much do I owe you?<p class="message sent">Your fare comes out to 50,000 KRW. Thanks for riding with me, and have a great time in Seoul!<p class=message>Thanks, I will. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=feb85dfa-0109-48c9-95b7-e82c9364ca44.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
