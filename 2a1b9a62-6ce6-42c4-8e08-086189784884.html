You must be excited to visit this vineyard. What's your favourite type of wine?<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you, A. Yes, thrilled to be here. You know, I usually go for reds, but I'm open to try anything new.<p class=message>Great! We have some fantastic reds here. But I recommend trying the Chardonnay, which is renowned in this region.<p class="message sent">Oh, really? I thought Chardonnay was a much lighter wine. I never thought of it as a popular choice.<p class=message>That's the beauty of exploring new vineyards. You can discover new favourites. Here, try this one. It's made with a mix of oak and steel barrels, which gives it a unique flavour.<p class="message sent">Wow, this is delicious! I never knew a Chardonnay could taste this good.<p class=message>Yes, and did you know that South Australia is the largest wine producing state in Australia? It has over 18 wine regions, and they all produce distinctive varieties of wines.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. I've always thought that France and Italy were the wine producers of the world.<p class=message>They are, but we're not too far behind. South Australian vineyards are famous for their world-class Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon too.<p class="message sent">I must try those as well. By the way, how long does it take for the grapes to turn into wine?<p class=message>It usually takes around six to eight months for fermentation to occur, depending on the variety. And then the wine is aged for a few years before it's ready to be bottled and sold.<p class="message sent">So much time and effort goes into making a bottle of wine, and we just gulp it down.<p class=message>That's the beauty of it. Wine brings people together and creates amazing memories. Speaking of which, let's cheers to that.<p class="message sent">Cheers to that indeed! Thanks a lot for showing me around, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a13e386-a415-45dc-8b87-730a324cf6ed.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
