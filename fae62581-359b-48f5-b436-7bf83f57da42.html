How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, A. Just knee-deep in this ISO 27001 audit. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. It's a never-ending process, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Ha! You got that right. But I'll tell you what, I'm learning a ton about our IT systems.<p class=message>Me too. Did you know we have a server in the break room closet? Who knew?<p class="message sent">Really? I didn't know that. I'll make sure that's added to our inventory.<p class=message>Speaking of the break room, have you visited the new vending machines? They take credit cards now.<p class="message sent">No kidding! I'm going to have to try that out. I always forget to bring cash.<p class=message>Yeah, it's pretty convenient. But make sure you don't store any sensitive information on those machines.<p class="message sent">Noted. We'll make sure to include that in our security policy.<p class=message>Hey, have you seen the new security cameras in the parking lot?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What do they look like?<p class=message>They're those dome-shaped ones. Like something out of a spy movie.<p class="message sent">Cool! Maybe we can use them for some kind of team-building activity.<p class=message>Ha! I don't think our employees would appreciate being spied on like that.<p class="message sent">Good point. Let's stick to the trust exercises.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Well, back to the audit we go.<p class="message sent">Right. Let's hope we find more interesting tidbits along the way.<p class=message>Definitely. See you later, B.<p class="message sent">Take care, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fae36a6b-4356-44de-9bc9-208e8a21a652.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
