We've been working on designing the SQL Server database tables based on the system requirements.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear. Are there any new features or requirements that we should be aware of?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. We will need to add a table to record the customer's preferred payment method. That way, it'll be easier to provide payment processing options for them.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. Do you need any help getting started on that new table?<p class="message sent">Thanks for the offer, A. I think I've got it covered. But if I need any assistance, I know where to go.<p class=message>No problem, B. It's always good to make sure we're all on the same page. What other tables do we need to create for this new system?<p class="message sent">Well, we've got the customer, orders, and products tables in place already. We just need to establish relationships with the payment and shipping information tables.<p class=message>Got it. And based on our previous conversations, we'll need to add a table to track stock levels and availability, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. That table will be essential for inventory management and restocking efforts.<p class=message>Sounds like we're making great progress. Are there any challenges or concerns you see with the table designs?<p class="message sent">I'm confident in the design choices we've made so far, but we will need to make sure we're scaling the database properly. We don't want it to become overloaded when traffic and transactions increase.<p class=message>Understood. We'll need to keep an eye on that and make sure we're optimizing our queries and indexing as necessary.<p class="message sent">Exactly. But overall, I'm excited about this new system and the potential it has for our customers.<p class=message>Me too, B. It's great to be working on a project that will have a positive impact and help us stay ahead of the competition.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=edcca5d0-5096-4644-b47f-a21b4121bd84.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
