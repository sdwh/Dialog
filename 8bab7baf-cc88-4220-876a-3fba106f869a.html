I got a sweet tooth, what can I say?<p class=message>Well, we don't condone theft here, regardless of the reason.<p class="message sent">I understand, officer. Can I at least have a slice of that cake while I wait?<p class=message>(Laughs) Nice try, Mr. B. But no, you'll have to wait for your trial for that.<p class="message sent">(Sighs) Are you sure? It's a really good cake.<p class=message>(Chuckles) Yeah, I'm sure. Now, let's get down to business. Why did you steal the cake?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I couldn't afford it. I lost my job and I haven't been able to find a new one.<p class=message>That's tough, but it still doesn't give you the right to steal.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know. I just got desperate.<p class=message>Well, we may be able to help you out. We have a program that helps people in your situation find jobs.<p class="message sent">Really? That would be great.<p class=message>Yes, but you'll have to complete a program and stay out of trouble. No more stealing.<p class="message sent">I understand, officer. Thank you.<p class=message>No problem. It's always better to help someone turn their life around than to just lock them up.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I appreciate it. And if I ever want cake again, I'll make sure to save up for it.<p class=message>(Laughs) Sounds like a plan, Mr. B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8bab0515-bb86-4dc3-9d14-b6bff303e23a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
