It's one of my favorite dishes.<p class="message sent">Schnitzel? Isn't that just a fancy name for chicken nuggets?<p class=message>No way! Schnitzel is a breaded and fried thin cutlet of meat, usually veal or pork. It's so tasty!<p class="message sent">Hmm, that does sound interesting. What do you usually eat it with?<p class=message>Well, traditional accompaniments are potatoes, either roasted or mashed, and a side of salad.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like a pretty heavy meal. Do you have it often?<p class=message>Not too often, but when I do, I make sure to savor every bite.<p class="message sent">I can respect that. Are there any good restaurants around here that serve Schnitzel?<p class=message>Yes, actually there's one not too far from here that's really popular among locals. Their Schnitzel is to die for.<p class="message sent">Sounds fantastic! I'm definitely going to have to try it out sometime.<p class=message>You won't regret it, I promise. But fair warning, it's pretty filling, so make sure to bring your appetite.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I always come hungry when there's good food involved. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class=message>Anytime! I'm always happy to talk about food. Speaking of which, have you tried any new dishes lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, I had some amazing sushi the other day that just melted in my mouth. It was a real treat.<p class=message>Ohh, sushi is one of my all-time favorites. We should plan a food adventure day and try out all the best sushi and Schnitzel spots around town.<p class="message sent">Yes! Let's do it. Food comas, here we come!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a649bd71-d646-4fea-ae8b-83cde0419987.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
