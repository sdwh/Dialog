I've finished setting up the database and the API endpoints.<p class=message>Great. I'm almost done with the front-end user interface. Would you like to take a look?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Let me see what you've come up with.<p class=message>*shares screen*<p class="message sent">Wow, that looks fantastic! You really have an eye for design.<p class=message>Thanks, B! I've been studying some UI/UX principles on the side.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you did. It shows in our website's layout and usability.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have you thought about adding any security measures to our site?<p class="message sent">Of course. I've integrated SSL encryption and implemented some measures to prevent SQL injection attacks. How about you?<p class=message>I added a captcha verification during registration to prevent bots from signing up.<p class="message sent">Nice. We make a good team.<p class=message>Yeah, we complement each other's strengths.<p class="message sent">By the way, how do you like games? Are you more into strategy or action games?<p class=message>I prefer strategy games. What about you?<p class="message sent">Action games are my favorite. But I also enjoy puzzle games from time to time.<p class=message>Same here. Do you have any favorite games you're currently playing?<p class="message sent">I'm currently hooked on a racing game called Horizon Chase Turbo. What about you?<p class=message>I'm playing Civilization VI. It's been keeping me entertained during my free time.<p class="message sent">That's cool. Maybe we can have a game night sometime and play together.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea! Let's plan it out after we launch our website.<p class="message sent">Deal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7d551427-b8e6-47dd-b7f1-330f5939fbb1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
