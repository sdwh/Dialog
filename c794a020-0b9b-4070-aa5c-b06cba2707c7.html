I hear you're a musician.<p class=message>Yes, that's right. I've been playing guitar for over ten years.<p class="message sent">Impressive. So, let's get down to business. I looked over your demo and I think it has potential.<p class=message>Thank you. I put a lot of work into it.<p class="message sent">I can tell. We're interested in signing you to our label.<p class=message>That's fantastic news! What would be the next steps?<p class="message sent">First, we'll need to discuss the details of the contract, such as royalties and promotion.<p class=message>I understand. Do you have any ideas for promoting my music?<p class="message sent">Definitely. We'll schedule a photo shoot and create a press kit to send out to radio stations and music blogs. We can also plan a release party to get some buzz going.<p class=message>Sounds great. I'm excited to get started.<p class="message sent">We're excited too. It's not often that we come across an artist with your talent.<p class=message>Thank you, I appreciate that.<p class="message sent">Of course. One last question - what's your favorite band or musician?<p class=message>That's a tough one. I would probably say Jimi Hendrix. His guitar playing was out of this world.<p class="message sent">Can't argue with that. Alright, I'll have my team draw up the contract and we'll get this ball rolling.<p class=message>Thank you so much. I can't wait to work with you.<p class="message sent">The feeling is mutual. Talk to you soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c7948aa5-1a36-46c9-a7a2-45404c17c921.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
