It’s about discussing the protection of our nation's secrets.<p class=message>That sounds serious. Who are we meeting?<p class="message sent">We’re going to meet an information security engineer and a network security expert. They are supposed to enlighten us on how to safeguard our nation's classified information.<p class=message>That sounds like a job for James Bond, doesn't it?<p class="message sent">Yeah! We’ll have to bring out our inner spy to understand their lingo.<p class=message>Do you think they’ll be like those cyber security experts in the movies who can hack into anything?<p class="message sent">Who knows! But what we can hope for is that they’ll reveal some amazing security tricks that we can use to protect our secrets.<p class=message>I think this is an important meeting, and we'll have to be extra cautious with our questions.<p class="message sent">Let's not forget to pack our spy glasses and earpieces.<p class=message>Hahaha! It's not about playing spy games, but I do agree that we need to keep our ears sharp to learn from these experts.<p class="message sent">You're right! I'm looking forward to the meeting. It sounds intriguing and informative.<p class=message>Me too! Let's get ready to be attentive, to ask smart questions and, most importantly, to have fun while learning about national security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=02902a66-8600-4814-abad-2790d80e0181.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
