We have to build a scalable data processing system for our cloud platform.<p class="message sent">Yes, I heard about it. It sounds exciting! We will need a data engineer like you and a cloud architect like me to make it happen.<p class=message>That's right. My job is to make sure the data is properly structured, cleaned and stored.<p class="message sent">And my job is to design a platform that can handle a large volume of data and provide efficient processing power.<p class=message>What about the language we should use for the platform?<p class="message sent">We can use whatever language works best for the job. Python, Java, SQL, etc. The important thing is that it's a language we are both familiar with.<p class=message>That makes sense. How about the storage? Should we use a relational or non-relational database?<p class="message sent">We could use both. A NoSQL database like MongoDB to handle unstructured data and a relational database like MySQL to handle structured data.<p class=message>That's a good point. How about the security of the data?<p class="message sent">We should make sure that the data is encrypted and that there are proper access controls in place. We can also implement a backup system to prevent data loss.<p class=message>I agree. What about the computing power? How do we make sure that our system is scalable?<p class="message sent">We can use a distributed computing system like Hadoop or Spark, which allows us to process large volumes of data in parallel across multiple machines.<p class=message>That sounds impressive. I can't wait to see the final product!<p class="message sent">Me too. With our skills combined, we can build an awesome scalable data processing system that will benefit our cloud platform and our customers.<p class=message>Alright, let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1c6099ee-034e-41fa-97ba-2fdac485a680.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
