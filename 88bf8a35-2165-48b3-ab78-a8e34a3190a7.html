Can you state your name for the record?<p class="message sent">Good morning. My name is Jack.<p class=message>Alright, Jack. Can you tell us about your whereabouts last night?<p class="message sent">I was at home all night, officer.<p class=message>Is there anyone who can confirm your alibi?<p class="message sent">Well, I was with my cat, but I don't think he can talk.<p class=message>(chuckles) I see. What were you doing at home all night?<p class="message sent">Mostly binge-watching a new show on Netflix.<p class=message>I know the feeling. What's the name of the show?<p class="message sent">It's called Stranger Things. Have you seen it, officer?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's a great show.<p class="message sent">I know, right? The 80s vibe is so cool.<p class=message>(smirks) Let's get back to the matter at hand. We have reports of a theft at a store last night. Was it you?<p class="message sent">No, officer. I swear I didn't steal anything.<p class=message>Alright. We have to investigate further, but for now, enjoy your stay here in the station. We'll make sure to provide you with a good cup of coffee.<p class="message sent">Thanks, officer. Can I watch Netflix while I wait?<p class=message>(laughs) No, I'm afraid not. But you can read a book or something.<p class="message sent">(rolling his eyes) Fine, whatever you say.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=88be3e47-8f2c-4b44-bc59-ad8134e39caa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
