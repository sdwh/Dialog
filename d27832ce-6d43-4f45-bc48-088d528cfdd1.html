Today we have our special guest, software engineer B joining us to talk about the latest trends in backend development.<p class="message sent">Thanks for having me A, it’s a pleasure to be here.<p class=message>So B, what’s the latest in the backend development world?<p class="message sent">Well, the most popular framework right now is Node.js which allows for server-side JavaScript development. It’s fast, lightweight and easy to use.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. What else?<p class="message sent">Another trend is using GraphQL instead of REST APIs. GraphQL has a more efficient query system which provides more flexibility for developers to fetch data from servers.<p class=message>Wow, that's quite innovative. Is it easy to learn?<p class="message sent">Yes, it’s not very difficult to learn. Plus, there are many online resources such as the official GraphQL website providing tutorials and documentation.<p class=message>Excellent! Any other backend development trends you want to add?<p class="message sent">Yes, containerization is another trend that has been gaining popularity. Developers use containers to deploy applications in a more secure and scalable environment.<p class=message>Fascinating! What do you think the future holds for backend development?<p class="message sent">It’s hard to say, but I believe that serverless architecture and microservices will become more prevalent. Plus, advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence will bring new and exciting developments to the field.<p class=message>Thank you so much for sharing your insights, B. We appreciate having you on the show today.<p class="message sent">I had a great time talking with you, A. Thank you for having me.<p class=message>That’s it for today's tech segment, folks! See you next time with more exciting tech trends.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d277e223-3fc7-4bcd-8bba-d99b237213d9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
