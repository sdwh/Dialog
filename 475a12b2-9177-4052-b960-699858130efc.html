But you know what they say, with great power comes great responsibility.<p class=message>That's true. We've got to make sure our app is reliable and trustworthy.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Otherwise, we'll just be another fish in the sea of digital currencies.<p class=message>Speaking of fish, have you tried out that sushi place down the street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it good?<p class=message>Oh, it's incredible. They have this unique sushi roll filled with avocado and mango. It's a must-try.<p class="message sent">You had me at avocado. Let's grab lunch there and brainstorm about our app.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. By the way, have you seen the latest episode of Black Mirror? It's all about blockchain.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I saw it. It's fascinating how blockchain could change the way we live our lives.<p class=message>Definitely. And it's thrilling to be a part of that change.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We have a responsibility to ensure that our app reflects the positive aspects of blockchain technology.<p class=message>Hey, have you ever thought of creating a blockchain-based music streaming service?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We could use smart contracts to streamline the royalty payment process.<p class=message>And users could earn cryptocurrency for listening to music. It could revolutionize the industry!<p class="message sent">You're full of good ideas, A. Let's add that to our list of potential projects.<p class=message>And when our app takes off, we can celebrate with a round of avocado-mango sushi rolls.<p class="message sent">I can't wait! Let's get to work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=475a08da-6e7c-4795-aa27-3bb8997a363e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
