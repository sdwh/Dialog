We have a lot of fresh seafood options available here in Tasmania.<p class=message>That's great! What's on the menu for today?<p class="message sent">Today we are going to prepare a famous Tasmanian dish called a "scallops pie" using freshly caught scallops.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! I have never made a pie before, but I'm eager to learn.<p class="message sent">No worries, pie-making is easier than it seems. First, we need to make the pastry dough.<p class=message>Alright, let's get started! Do you have any tips for making a perfect dough?<p class="message sent">Yes, the key is to make sure the butter is cold and to handle the dough as little as possible.<p class=message>Okay, I'll keep that in mind. And what about the filling? What ingredients do we need?<p class="message sent">The filling is relatively simple. We will be using scallops, cream, butter, onions, and a few other secret ingredients.<p class=message>Ooh, secret ingredients! I can't wait to see what those are.<p class="message sent">Haha, the recipe has been passed down in my family for generations. Now, let's get to work on the pie crust.<p class=message>This is really fun, I never thought I would be making a scallops pie. How long do we need to bake it for?<p class="message sent">It usually takes around 30-40 minutes to cook fully. While we wait, would you like to try some other seafood dishes?<p class=message>Definitely! What else do you recommend?<p class="message sent">We could make some garlic prawns or seared salmon with lemon butter. Both are crowd-pleasers!<p class=message>Wow, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Let's do both!<p class="message sent">Great idea! You're a fast learner, A. Cooking is definitely an art, but with a little practice, anyone can do it.<p class=message>I agree, this has been such a fun experience. Thank you for sharing your family's recipe with me!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=29d181ba-8ccf-46db-9d29-0739766cc884.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
