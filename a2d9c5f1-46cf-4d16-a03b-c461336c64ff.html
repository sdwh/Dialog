How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Well, as a matter of fact, I have a proposition for you. I'm opening a new restaurant nearby and I'd like to offer your coffee in the menu.<p class=message>That sounds like an excellent opportunity! What sort of dishes are you planning to serve?<p class="message sent">A mix of local and international cuisine. We'll have traditional Swiss dishes like cheese fondue and, also, pasta, burgers, and fries.<p class=message>I see. In that case, I think our house blend would be suitable. It has a medium body with hints of chocolate and nutty flavor.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! Aside from regular coffee, do you have any recommendations for our latte and cappuccino?<p class=message>Our syrups are a customer favorite for flavor variations, and we also offer latte art. Our baristas can even create a bear or a heart-shaped design on the foam.<p class="message sent">Wow, that would be a nice touch! How about the pricing?<p class=message>We can offer a special rate for wholesale orders, but it would depend on your volume and frequency of orders.<p class="message sent">Sounds fair enough. Let's discuss further about the details.<p class=message>Sure, I can prepare a quotation for your review. Would you like to sample some of our coffee, perhaps?<p class="message sent">That would be delightful! Let's do a taste test today.<p class=message>Perfect, we'll be glad to have you. By the way, do you offer any vegan options in your restaurant?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do! We understand the importance of catering to different dietary needs, so we have a dedicated section on our menu for vegan and vegetarian dishes.<p class=message>Great to know that! We also have alternative milk options like soy, almond, and oat milk.<p class="message sent">Even better! I'm glad we share the same values. I'm excited to work with your team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a2d95564-1601-48f5-bf02-c8526b96bd7b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
