How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks for asking. So, what did you do over the weekend?<p class="message sent">I went to a music festival and saw a lot of great performers. It was awesome!<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of music did you listen to?<p class="message sent">I listened to a variety of music, from rock to pop to hip-hop. It was really cool.<p class=message>That's fantastic. Speaking of music, how's your guitar practice going?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty well. I've been practicing every day and I feel like I'm making progress.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you have any questions or concerns that you want to go over today?<p class="message sent">Actually, there is something I wanted to ask you. How important is music theory for playing guitar?<p class=message>Music theory is definitely important for playing guitar, but it's not necessary to be a great player. However, it can really help you understand the music you're playing and make it easier to improvise.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Thanks for explaining that.<p class=message>No problem. Do you want to start practicing a new song today?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm down for that. What song do you recommend?<p class=message>How about "Wonderwall" by Oasis? It's a classic song that's popular with guitarists.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Let's get started!<p class=message>Alright, I'll play it for you first and then we can go over the chords together.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Can't wait to learn it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=29f19c56-2017-4a8c-8c92-c0917346ef26.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
