I'm a software testing engineer. Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hey! I'm an automation testing expert. Great to meet you too.<p class=message>So, what kind of testing tools and processes do you use on a daily basis?<p class="message sent">Well, I use tools like Selenium, Appium, and Katalon for automation testing. And for processes, I follow Agile and the KANBAN methodology.<p class=message>Aha, those are some popular tools and methodologies. How do you ensure the quality of your tests?<p class="message sent">I always make sure to validate the results and apply the right tests and checks. Also, I prioritize running tests depending on the risks and importance of the features.<p class=message>That makes sense. Do you ever have any funny or interesting experiences while testing?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. One time, I was testing a new feature and accidentally broke the app so it wouldn't launch. My team had a good laugh about it.<p class=message>(laughs) Oops, I can imagine. I once spent a whole day trying to troubleshoot a bug, only to find out it was because the device I was testing on had low battery.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Been there, done that. It's those little things we overlook that can have a big impact.<p class=message>Definitely. How do you approach testing for different platforms like mobile and desktop?<p class="message sent">I usually start with testing on the most commonly used platform to catch any critical bugs. Then, I expand to other platforms based on their usage statistics.<p class=message>Makes sense. I typically follow a similar approach. Well, it was really nice talking to you!<p class="message sent">Yes, it was great chatting! Take care and happy testing!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b8e1a85d-bb65-4365-8d29-692b6bd81c82.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
