Did you see the results of the vulnerability scan?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did. It looks like we have a lot of work to do.<p class=message>No kidding. I feel like I need a vacation after looking at all those issues.<p class="message sent">Haha, don't we all. But seriously, we need to get on top of those vulnerabilities before our systems get compromised.<p class=message>Agreed. So where do we start?<p class="message sent">Well, let's prioritize the issues by severity and then focus on the ones that pose the greatest risk.<p class=message>Good idea. And once we identify the vulnerabilities, I can use my hacking skills to test if they're truly exploitable.<p class="message sent">Wait, are you saying you're going to hack into our own systems?<p class=message>Relax, it's all ethical hacking. Think of it as breaking into our own house to test the locks.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. You know, you're lucky you have those hacking skills. I only know how to work with databases.<p class=message>Hey, don't sell yourself short. Managing all those databases is no easy task. And besides, we all have our own areas of expertise.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate that. And you're right, we make a good team. I'll get started on applying the patches while you work on testing the vulnerabilities.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. And once we're done, let's celebrate with some pizza and beer!<p class="message sent">Now you're talking! Let's hope our systems are as strong as our pizza cravings.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=25ad0360-08ed-4b38-be2e-c99b437a56fc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
