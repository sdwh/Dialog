Today looks like it's going to be a really busy day.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's always busy on weekends. I'm ready to fry up some delicious chicken!<p class=message>Great! We have some new customers coming in today, so let's make sure everything is extra tasty.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I always make sure my fried chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.<p class=message>That's what makes your chicken so popular! Have you thought about adding any new menu items?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was thinking of trying out some fried pickles or maybe even some fried Oreos.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! We'll have to test them out and see how customers respond.<p class="message sent">Definitely! By the way, have you tried our new French fry seasoning? It's been a hit with our regulars.<p class=message>I haven't yet, but I'll have to give it a try. Speaking of regulars, have you seen our favorite customer, Mr. Johnson, lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, he was just in here last week. He always orders the same thing - a three-piece chicken meal with a side of coleslaw.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear he's still coming in. We need to make sure we keep our regulars happy.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And if we keep making delicious food like this, we'll keep getting new customers too.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Thanks for all of your hard work today, B. Let's make this a great day for our customers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2f4ee561-dc66-4355-afb3-65243de52c51.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
