I'm excited to use the freshest fruits straight from the orchard.<p class=message>Great! Let me show you the fruits we picked - some juicy peaches, plump strawberries and ripe apples.<p class="message sent">Wow, these are amazing! I'm thinking we could make a mixed fruit tart with a vanilla custard filling.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! How about we also make some grilled peaches with honey and cinnamon as a side dish?<p class="message sent">Perfect! And let's not forget about the strawberries, we could make a fresh strawberry salsa to go with some grilled chicken.<p class=message>Yum, that's making me hungry already. Do you need any help with prepping?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, would you mind slicing the apples while I whip up the custard? And we can take turns grilling the peaches.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. So, do you always use fresh produce?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, using fresh produce makes all the difference in the taste of the dish.<p class=message>That's true, it's great to support local farmers too. Speaking of which, how long have you been cooking for?<p class="message sent">I've been cooking professionally for about 10 years now, but I've always enjoyed cooking since I was a kid.<p class=message>That's a long time! What made you want to become a chef?<p class="message sent">I love experimenting with different flavors and ingredients, and cooking is a way to express that creativity. Plus, who doesn't love good food, right?<p class=message>Absolutely! It's amazing how food brings people together, like how we're bonding over cooking right now.<p class="message sent">Definitely, and it's even better when the food turns out great. I'm really looking forward to trying out our dishes.<p class=message>Me too! It's been a fun day picking out the fruits and now making these dishes together. Can't wait to dig in!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=af0ff393-0391-4fc4-af0b-b6120ebeb925.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
