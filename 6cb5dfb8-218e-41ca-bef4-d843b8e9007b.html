Are you ready to take me to the airport?<p class="message sent">Good morning, sir. Yes, I am. Are you excited about your trip?<p class=message>Absolutely! I'm going to Perth, Australia. Have you ever been?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But I've heard it's a beautiful place. Is this your first time there?<p class=message>Yes, it is. I've always wanted to visit Perth, and I've finally got the chance.<p class="message sent">That's wonderful to hear. Do you have any plans while you're there?<p class=message>Yes, I plan to visit some of the famous beaches like Cottesloe and Scarborough, and also check out the wildlife at the Perth Zoo.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great itinerary. My favorite beach is definitely Scarborough. The water is so clear and blue.<p class=message>That's good to know. I also heard that Perth has a great food scene. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Oh absolutely! You have to try the fish and chips at Cicerello's in Fremantle. It's a bit of a drive, but totally worth it.<p class=message>Great, thanks for the tip. By the way, what do you do when you're not driving passengers around?<p class="message sent">I like to spend time with my family, and I also play soccer with my friends on the weekends.<p class=message>That sounds like fun. What position do you play?<p class="message sent">I'm a goalkeeper. It's a tough job, but someone has to do it!<p class=message>Haha, I bet! Well, we're almost at the airport now. Thanks for the ride and for the great conversation.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, sir. Have a safe and enjoyable trip to Perth!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6cb04519-b49c-405c-9cb1-b4a8e8c47dc6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
