How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm good, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks for asking. So, what's the route you're taking to get to Nanjing?<p class="message sent">I usually take the highway as it's the quickest way. But if you have any preference, I can take another route.<p class=message>Oh no, the highway is fine. I just hope there's no traffic.<p class="message sent">Yeah, traffic can be quite bad sometimes. But we can play some music to relax.<p class=message>That's a good idea! What kind of music do you like?<p class="message sent">I'm a classic rock fan. How about you?<p class=message>I love pop music. But I think classic rock is great. Let's listen to that.<p class="message sent">Alright. *turns on the radio and Guns N' Roses' "Sweet Child O' Mine" plays*<p class=message>Oh, I love this song! *sings along*<p class="message sent">*laughs* You have a great voice!<p class=message>*laughs* Thank you! You're too kind.<p class="message sent">Actually, I used to be in a band when I was younger.<p class=message>Really? What did you play?<p class="message sent">I was a drummer. It was a lot of fun.<p class=message>Wow, that's so cool. Do you ever play anymore?<p class="message sent">Sometimes, but not as often as I'd like. Life gets in the way sometimes.<p class=message>Yeah, I hear you. I wish I could play an instrument.<p class="message sent">It's never too late to start!<p class=message>I might just take you up on that advice. Thanks for the ride and the great conversation!<p class="message sent">No problem. It was my pleasure.
