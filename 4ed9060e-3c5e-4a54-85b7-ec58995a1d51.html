I actually love them.<p class=message>Really? I tried them for the first time last week and wasn't sure if I liked them or not.<p class="message sent">Ah, that's understandable. They're definitely an acquired taste.<p class=message>Yeah, I think I might have to try them a few more times before I decide if I like them or not.<p class="message sent">Well, when you do come around to liking them, make sure to try them with a squeeze of lemon juice. It really enhances the flavor.<p class=message>Oh, I didn't know that. I'll have to give that a try.<p class="message sent">And have you tried them with a bit of hot sauce?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is that good?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. It gives them a nice little kick.<p class=message>Hmm, maybe I'll try that next time.<p class="message sent">Also, make sure to have them with a nice glass of white wine. It pairs perfectly with oysters.<p class=message>I see, I'll have to remember that. Thanks for the tips.<p class="message sent">No problem. Oysters can be a little tricky to get into, but once you do, they're so enjoyable.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Let me know if you discover any new ways to enjoy oysters.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4ed86fc2-ae66-431e-bce3-9e95aa40b4a3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
