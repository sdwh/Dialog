Which one do you want to go on first, B?"<p class="message sent">"I want to go on the Ferris wheel, dad. Can we ride it together?"<p class=message>"Sure thing, let's get in line. We'll have a great view of the whole park from up there."<p class="message sent">"Whoa, this is really high up! Look at all the people down there, they look like ants."<p class=message>"It's kind of peaceful up here, don't you think? And we can see the entire park from up top."<p class="message sent">"Yeah, it's like we're on top of the world! Can we go on the roller coaster next?"<p class=message>"Absolutely. I'll admit, I'm a little scared of roller coasters, but I'll be brave for you, B."<p class="message sent">"Don't worry, Dad. I'll hold your hand the whole time. We'll scream our heads off together!"<p class=message>"Haha, okay. It's a deal. Looks like we might have to wait in line for a little while though."<p class="message sent">"That's okay, we can people-watch while we wait. Look at that kid over there, he's eating an ice cream cone bigger than his face!"<p class=message>"Ha, yeah. There are some interesting characters here today. But hey, we're pretty interesting too, right?"<p class="message sent">"Definitely! I'm having so much fun with you today, Dad. Thank you for bringing me here."<p class=message>"Of course, B.
