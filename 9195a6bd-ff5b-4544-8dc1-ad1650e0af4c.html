Good to catch up with you. I heard you are currently working on automating our testing process. How's that coming along?<p class="message sent">Hey A! Yes, I am. It's quite challenging but rewarding. We need to make sure that our automated tests cover all scenarios.<p class=message>Yeah, I totally agree. Automation is key to save time and improve efficiency. Have you considered using any specific tools yet for the automation?<p class="message sent">Definitely! We have been trying out a few tools like Selenium and Appium. They are great for web and mobile testing respectively.<p class=message>Sounds good. And how about the deployment process? Are you thinking of automating that too?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. With automated deployment, we can ensure consistency and decrease the chances of human error. We are thinking of using Jenkins for that.<p class=message>Good choice. Jenkins is a great tool for continuous integration and deployment. Have you faced any challenges so far?<p class="message sent">Yes, one of the challenges we faced was testing the integration of our different modules. The configurations and dependencies can get quite complex.<p class=message>I hear you. Integration testing is always tricky. But I'm sure you will figure it out. Keep up the good work, B!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! It's nice to know that we have each other's support in implementing these new processes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=91947255-9672-4dfe-9e78-c404ee6c9781.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
