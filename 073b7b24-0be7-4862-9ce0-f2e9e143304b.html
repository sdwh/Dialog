How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good. So, let's talk about the progress with the project. How's it going?<p class="message sent">It's coming along nicely. We've managed to stay on schedule and we're on track to meet our deadline.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Have there been any challenges or setbacks we need to address?<p class="message sent">Well, we did have a slight delay last week when our internet connection went down, but we were able to catch up quickly.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear it didn't affect the project too much. Is there anything you need from me or the team to help keep things moving smoothly?<p class="message sent">Actually, we could use some more resources for the next phase. Can we discuss the budget and see what's feasible?<p class=message>Definitely. Let's schedule a meeting with the finance team to see what we can do. On a lighter note, did you catch the game last night?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! It was a close one but my team pulled through in the end. Fortunately, I wasn't too nervous while watching it.<p class=message>Ha! I hear you. I can get pretty anxious when it comes to sports. But it sounds like it was a good game overall.<p class="message sent">Yes, it was. Anyway, back to work. When do you think we can have that budget meeting?<p class=message>How about we schedule it for later this week? In the meantime, keep me posted on any updates with the project.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=073b1083-6d70-4c75-9de0-20f4703273ac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
