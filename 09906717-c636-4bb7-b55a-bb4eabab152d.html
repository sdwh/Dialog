What can I do?<p class=message>Well, as a first step, I would suggest having a chat with your neighbor and informing them of the situation. If that doesn't work, we can explore legal options.<p class="message sent">Okay, sounds good. On a lighter note, have you seen any good movies lately?<p class=message>Yes, I just watched "The Godfather" for the first time. It was amazing.<p class="message sent">Really? I can't believe you hadn't seen it before. How about any recent comedies? I need a good laugh.<p class=message>"Bridesmaids" always puts a smile on my face.<p class="message sent">That one's a classic. Speaking of classics, what's your favorite book?<p class=message>That's a tough question, but I have to say "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee.<p class="message sent">That's a great choice. Do you have any travel plans coming up?<p class=message>Not at the moment. With work being so busy, it's hard to find the time.<p class="message sent">I hear you. I've been meaning to take a trip to Europe, but I don't know if that'll happen anytime soon.<p class=message>It's definitely worth it when you can make the time. But let's refocus on your legal matter. Do you have any other questions for me?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=098ff65e-b76b-44b5-8cc8-a2545dc97082.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
