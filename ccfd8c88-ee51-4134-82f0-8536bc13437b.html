How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, feeling a bit tired, but excited for tonight's service.<p class="message sent">I can imagine, our guests are in for a treat with your delicious creations.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, I hope so. Have you seen tonight's menu yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, it looks amazing, especially the grilled sea bass and roasted butternut squash.<p class=message>Ah, those are two of my favorites as well. I think the sea bass is going to be a hit, especially with the lime and chili glaze.<p class="message sent">For sure, I can already smell it from the kitchen.<p class=message>(smiling) That's a good sign. Oh, and speaking of smells, have you tried our new garlic aioli yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What should I pair it with?<p class=message>Honestly, it goes well with just about anything. I've been using it as a dipping sauce for the bread and it's been a hit.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You had me at garlic. I'll have to try it ASAP.<p class=message>(chuckles) I know the feeling. So, have any interesting stories from the dining room tonight?<p class="message sent">Actually, I do. One of our regulars came in with their new puppy and it's been stealing the show all night.<p class=message>(smiling) That sounds adorable. I hope the puppy doesn't try to sneak into the kitchen.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I'll make sure to keep an eye on it. Speaking of which, do you need any help with anything back there?<p class=message>Actually, yes. Could you give me a hand with prepping the asparagus for the grilled vegetable medley?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'll be right back with my apron.<p class=message>(gratefully) Thank you, B. I knew I could count on you.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Anytime, Chef.
