Keeps us on our toes!<p class=message>Definitely. Speaking of toes, I think I need a new pair of shoes. These ones are killing me.<p class="message sent">Oh no, that's not good. You should try getting some comfortable insoles.<p class=message>Good idea, I'll take a look online later. So, have you tried any of the new drinks on the menu?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I tried the lavender latte and it was surprisingly delicious.<p class=message>Lavender in coffee? That sounds strange but intriguing.<p class="message sent">It's definitely worth a try. And speaking of strange but delicious, have you tried the avocado toast?<p class=message>Oh yes, that's one of my go-to meals here. The combination of avocado and feta cheese is unbeatable.<p class="message sent">I'm hungry just thinking about it. Maybe we should grab some for ourselves during our break.<p class=message>Yes, absolutely. And we can sit outside on the patio now that the weather is nice again.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. By the way, have you seen the latest viral dance challenge on social media?<p class=message>Oh, the one where you dance with a broom? Yeah, it's taking over my timeline.<p class="message sent">I know, right? I think we should make a coffee shop version of it and post it online.<p class=message>Yes! That would be hilarious. We could use the milk frother as our "broom".<p class="message sent">(laughs) I love it, let's do it. But first, let's finish these orders and get our caffeine fix.<p class=message>Agreed. It's time to put our barista skills to the test.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=420302b9-86d6-44b7-b422-d9d0c4b9dd86.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
