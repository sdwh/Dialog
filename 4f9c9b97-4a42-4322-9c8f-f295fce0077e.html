Welcome to Asakusa Temple, the oldest temple in Tokyo!<p class="message sent">Hello there, everyone. As you can see, the architecture here is absolutely stunning. The temple was built in the 7th century, and it's a symbol of Buddhism in Japan.<p class=message>That's right. And did you know that the Asakusa Festival, held every year in summer, attracts thousands of tourists from all over the world? It's a must-see event, I promise you.<p class="message sent">Speaking of festivals, have you tried some of the local street food yet? You can find some delicious snacks and sweets here, like the famous traditional rice crackers, or "senbei."<p class=message>Actually, I have, and I highly recommend them. But let's not forget the reason we're here: to learn about the temple's history and significance in Japanese culture.<p class="message sent">Indeed. Asakusa Temple has been destroyed and rebuilt several times due to earthquakes and war, but it has always been a place of hope and spiritual healing.<p class=message>And if you look closely, you'll notice the countless lanterns hanging around the temple. Each one was donated by a local business or individual to pray for good fortune and happiness.<p class="message sent">That's right. And before we move on to the next stop on our tour, I'd like to remind you to show your respect and follow the rules of the temple, such as removing your shoes before entering and remaining quiet during prayer.<p class=message>Thank you, B, for those wise words. Now, let's take a few moments to appreciate the beauty and tranquility of this sacred site.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4f8e6e83-c5d6-43de-8923-b38649710393.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
