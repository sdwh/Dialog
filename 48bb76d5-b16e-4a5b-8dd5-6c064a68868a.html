How's the data analyzing going?<p class="message sent">It's overwhelming as usual, but I'm hanging in there. How about you? Any updates on the marketing plan?<p class=message>Yes, actually. Our numbers show that our snack sales are highest on Fridays and Saturdays. I think it's because people tend to let loose during the weekends.<p class="message sent">Hmm, interesting. Maybe we can promote our snacks more during those days. Any ideas on how to do that?<p class=message>Well, we could create promotions that offer a free snack with a purchase or discounts on certain items on Fridays and Saturdays. That way, people will be more inclined to buy.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! How about social media? Are we getting enough reach there?<p class=message>Our social media engagement rate is pretty high, but I think we can still do better. Maybe we should partner up with some influencers to promote our products.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I like the way you think. Let's gather some data on popular influencers and see if we can work with them.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Oh, by the way, have you tried the new popcorn flavor that just came in?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. Is it good?<p class=message>It's amazing! We should definitely promote that too.<p class="message sent">You know what? I have an idea. Let's create a taste test booth where customers can try the new popcorn flavor for free. That way, we can get people talking about it.<p class=message>Brilliant! I love it. Let's make it happen.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=48b9343e-4427-493a-a8fa-0e5d63f12c9a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
