Is there anything I should be aware of, here in your supermarket?<p class="message sent">Good morning! No worries, we always try our best to keep our products fresh and in good conditions. But if there's anything, you're very welcome to take a look around.<p class=message>Perfect, thank you. Hey, what's that new product you have there on the shelves?<p class="message sent">Oh, that one? It's a new type of cheese from Italy. It's called "Mozzarella del Re". Would you like to try it?<p class=message>Yes, please! Mmmm, delicious! It's creamy and tastes a bit like hazelnut. And it's not too salty. I think I might have to buy some.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it. Would you like me to wrap it for you?<p class=message>Yes, please do that. Hey, do you know any English jokes I could share with my colleagues?<p class="message sent">Sure! Here's one: What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!<p class=message>Haha, that's so funny! Thank you, I'll definitely use that one!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Oh, I almost forgot. Today, we have a special discount on our fresh strawberries. Would you like to try some?<p class=message>Yes, please. Hmm, these are good, nice and sweet. How much are they?<p class="message sent">They are usually £2.50, but today you can have them for just £1.50.<p class=message>That's a great deal! I'll take two boxes, please.<p class="message sent">No problem. Thank you for shopping with us. Do you need a bag?<p class=message>Yes, please. Thanks again. It's been a pleasure shopping here today.<p class="message sent">And it's been great having you here. Have a lovely day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ca428559-6f8c-4986-a076-e7c9fb5efb31.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
