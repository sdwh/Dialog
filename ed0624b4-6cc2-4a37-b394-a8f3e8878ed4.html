I can't believe you're already 21.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Dad! I'm excited to celebrate with my favorite people.<p class=message>We booked a fancy restaurant for your birthday dinner. Do you like the ambiance?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's perfect. Thanks for choosing it, Dad.<p class=message>So, what do you want to order for dinner? I heard their lobster is amazing.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I want to try their steak. I heard it's their signature dish.<p class=message>Good choice! And for dessert, we'll have their famous chocolate cake.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds delicious. Dad, tell me, what was the best birthday present you've ever received?<p class=message>Well, that's a tough one. But I think the year your mom surprised me with tickets to my favorite football game was pretty amazing.<p class="message sent">That sounds like an awesome present. Maybe I should start planning for your next birthday already!<p class=message>(laughs) You don't have to do that, just spending time with you and seeing you happy is the best gift I could ask for.<p class="message sent">Aww, Dad, you're the sweetest.<p class=message>(winks) And I believe you take after your old man in the sweetness department.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Thanks, Dad. I'm not sure if that's a compliment, but I'll take it.<p class=message>(laughs) Of course it's a compliment! Speaking of compliments, I have to say you look stunning tonight. You're always beautiful, but tonight you really shine.<p class="message sent">(blushes) Thank you, Dad. You're making me feel special on my birthday.<p class=message>(smiling) Well, that's what dads are for. To make their daughters feel special and to embarrass them in front of their friends.<p class="message sent">(rolling her eyes) Yeah, thanks for that. But seriously, I feel lucky to have you as my dad. You always make me feel loved and supported.<p class=message>(puts his hand on hers) And I will always be here for you, no matter what. Happy birthday, my sweet girl.<p class="message sent">(squeezing his hand) I love you, Dad.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ecff7fc6-2fe3-454a-b2a6-3ddab747eaf0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
