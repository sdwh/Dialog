How was the commute to the music hall?<p class="message sent">It's not too bad. Just a 20-minute drive. How about you?<p class=message>I rode my bike here today. It's nice to get some fresh air before we start rehearsing.<p class="message sent">That's great. I can't imagine biking all the way here though.<p class=message>Ha! It's not that far, plus it's good exercise. Speaking of exercise, did you guys warm up before coming on stage?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we stretched and ran some scales before we got started.<p class=message>Perfect! Let's start with the opening number. Remember, we need to keep the tempo steady throughout the entire piece.<p class="message sent">Got it! I'll try to stay on beat this time.<p class=message>(laughs) Don't worry, we'll nail it today. What about the new arrangement? Did you guys have a chance to practice the harmonies?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we got together yesterday to go over it. I think it sounds really cool.<p class=message>Excellent. I'm excited to hear how it sounds on stage today.<p class="message sent">Hey, did you see that meme I sent you earlier?<p class=message>(chuckles) Oh, the one about musicians always being sharp? Yeah, it's too real.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Right? I thought it was hilarious. But we'll make sure we're all perfectly in tune today.<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's get to it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=89ee46c9-7d2c-4c9b-a7f2-a16d7d4e6c2c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
