I'm a reporter from the Better News Network. Can I interview you today?<p class="message sent">Sure, why not? What would you like to know?<p class=message>Well, I heard you're the owner of the world's largest collection of rubber ducks. Can you tell me a bit about that?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I've been collecting them for over 20 years now. I have over 10,000 rubber ducks from all over the world.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive! Do you have a favorite one?<p class="message sent">Yes, my favorite one is actually one that I found at a yard sale for only 50 cents. It's a rare limited edition duck from Japan.<p class=message>That's amazing. Have you ever had any weird experiences while collecting ducks?<p class="message sent">Well, one time I traveled all the way to Australia to purchase a rare duck for my collection. When I got home, I realized that it was a fake!<p class=message>Oh no! That's disappointing. So, do you ever use your rubber ducks for anything?<p class="message sent">Actually, I do. I've participated in duck races where people race their rubber ducks down a river. It's a lot of fun!<p class=message>That sounds like a blast. Do you have any advice for someone who wants to start collecting rubber ducks?<p class="message sent">Yes, my advice is to start small and have fun with it. Don't be afraid to ask people for their old rubber ducks. You never know what you might find!<p class=message>Well, thank you so much for speaking with me today. It was really interesting to learn about your rubber duck collection.<p class="message sent">No problem, thank you for having me!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6622e137-737b-4a67-bb59-a1e31fd1d8ba.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
