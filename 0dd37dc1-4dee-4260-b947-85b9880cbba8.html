Nice to meet you! I'm A, what's your name?<p class="message sent">Hi A, my name is B. Nice to meet you too! What game are you playing?<p class=message>I'm playing the new Halo game on Xbox Series S. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm playing FIFA 22. Do you like sports games?<p class=message>Yeah, I do! I used to play FIFA a lot, but I switched to shooting games because I'm no good at soccer.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's understandable. Shooting games are fun too! Have you played any other Halo games?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I'm a big fan of the series. What about you? Have you played any FIFA games before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've played almost all of them. I'm a big football fan, so I love these games. Who's your favorite FIFA team?<p class=message>Honestly, I don't have a favorite team. I just enjoy playing the game. What's your favorite team?<p class="message sent">My favorite team is Manchester City. They have some really talented players. Do you watch football?<p class=message>Yeah, I do. I usually watch the World Cup games. Who do you think will win the next World Cup?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough one. There are so many good teams out there. I'm rooting for Brazil, they always have a great team.<p class=message>Yeah, Brazil is really good. I'm hoping Japan will do well this time. They've been improving a lot lately.<p class="message sent">Japan is definitely getting better. They have some skilled players. Maybe they'll surprise everyone and win!<p class=message>That would be amazing! Hey, do you want to play a co-op game together sometime?<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds like fun! We should add each other on Xbox.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0dce9a56-5bf3-4900-827d-cb1b1fd8bd2e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
