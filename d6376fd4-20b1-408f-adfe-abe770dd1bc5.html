Can you share a funny story from your time in the circus?<p class="message sent">One time, during a performance, I accidentally tripped and fell into a pool of water. It was so embarrassing, but the audience loved it and I ended up incorporating it into my act.<p class=message>That's amazing! I bet it made for a great moment in the show. So, what else can readers expect from your book?<p class="message sent">Well, there are also some heartwarming stories about the close bonds I formed with my fellow performers, and some behind-the-scenes secrets about circus life.<p class=message>That sounds like a really fun read. I can't wait to get my hands on a copy. So, B, what's next for you after promoting this book?<p class="message sent">I'm actually planning on going on a world tour with a circus troupe.
