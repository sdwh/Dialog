How do you plan on tackling it?<p class="message sent">First, we need to gather a large dataset of real-world driving scenarios and use it to train our models. Then we can fine-tune them to better predict and react to different situations on the road.<p class=message>That makes sense. Do you think we can trust the AI to make the right decisions?<p class="message sent">With enough data and careful training, I believe we can make the system just as capable as a human driver. Plus, it won't get distracted by text messages or hot coffee!<p class=message>Ha! That's definitely a bonus. But what about unexpected road conditions, like a sudden truck tipping over?<p class="message sent">That's where we need to train the system to recognize anomalies and outliers. We can't predict everything, but we can give it the tools to react appropriately in the moment.<p class=message>I see. I'm not much of a programmer myself, but it sounds like you have everything under control. Can I help in any way?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We could use more input on the user interface design and how to communicate critical information to drivers. Plus, it never hurts to have a fresh pair of eyes on the code.<p class=message>Sounds like fun! Let's rock this self-driving car industry like a hurricane!<p class="message sent">Yee-haw! Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d6674aca-d695-49aa-9bc6-0ed0d89e459b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
