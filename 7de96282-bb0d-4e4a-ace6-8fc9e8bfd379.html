Can you take me there?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, mate! Going on a trip or coming back?<p class=message>Coming back. I just finished a conference in Sydney.<p class="message sent">Ahh, business trip huh? Did you have time to explore the city?<p class=message>Yeah, a bit. I went to the Opera House and walked around the Harbour Bridge. It's such a beautiful city.<p class="message sent">It sure is! Did you try any Aussie food?<p class=message>Yes, I had some meat pies and sausage rolls. They were delicious!<p class="message sent">Oh, that's great to hear! Did you spot any kangaroos or koalas while you were here?<p class=message>Unfortunately, no. But I did see some lorikeets and cockatoos at the park.<p class="message sent">That's pretty cool. Next time you come back, I'll take you to see some kangaroos at the wildlife park.<p class=message>I would love that! By the way, what's your name?<p class="message sent">My name's Dave. What's yours?<p class=message>I'm Sarah. Nice to meet you, Dave!<p class="message sent">Likewise, Sarah. What do you do for work?<p class=message>I'm a marketing manager for a software company. And you?<p class="message sent">I'm a taxi driver. Been doing it for 10 years now. Love it!<p class=message>That's awesome. I'm glad you enjoy your job. Do you get many tourists in your taxi?<p class="message sent">Yeah, plenty! I've met people from all over the world. It's great hearing their stories.<p class=message>I can imagine. Thanks for the ride, Dave. I'll certainly look you up whenever I come back to Sydney.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, Sarah.
