How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing good, thank you! How about you? Excited for your trip to Hong Kong?<p class=message>Yes, very excited! I've always wanted to visit Hong Kong. Have you lived here all your life?<p class="message sent">No, I lived in New York for a few years before moving to Hong Kong. I love it here though, it's a great city.<p class=message>That's cool. What's your favourite thing about Hong Kong?<p class="message sent">Definitely the food. You have to try some dim sum while you're here. There are so many good restaurants in the city.<p class=message>I'll have to make sure to do that. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I would recommend trying Tim Ho Wan or Tin Lung Heen. They both have amazing dim sum.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendations! So, what do you do in your free time when you're not driving?<p class="message sent">Well, I like to explore different neighbourhoods in the city and try new restaurants. I'm also a big fan of hiking and going to the beach.<p class=message>Sounds like you really enjoy your time here. Do you have any tips for tourists visiting Hong Kong for the first time?<p class="message sent">Definitely get an Octopus Card for the public transportation, especially the MTR. Also, be prepared for the crowds and bring comfortable shoes for all the walking.<p class=message>Great advice. Thanks for sharing! Oh, we're here already. How much do I owe you?<p class="message sent">That'll be HKD 150. Enjoy your stay in Hong Kong!<p class=message>Thank you, I will! Have a good day!<p class="message sent">You too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7d8e7c44-b6b4-4b0a-863d-c26cada9e04f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
