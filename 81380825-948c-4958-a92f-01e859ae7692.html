I bet he had a great crew.<p class=message>Definitely. Speaking of which, we're like a flying family up here.<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah. But let's make sure we stick to our roles or else we'll lose our minds.<p class=message>Agreed. I'll stick to flying and you can keep me company.<p class="message sent">You got it. And maybe I'll teach you a thing or two about entertainment...since we'll be up here for hours.<p class=message>Hey, don't forget about my killer dance moves. We can have a party up here.<p class="message sent">Oh boy, I better prepare for that one. But in all seriousness, let's make sure we stay focused on our mission.<p class=message>Of course, safety first. But we can still have a little fun, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'll bring out the snacks and you can pick the tunes.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. But let's also make sure we communicate effectively, especially during takeoff and landing.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We'll make sure to keep each other on our toes.<p class=message>Speaking of toes, I have to stretch my legs. Mind if I take a quick stroll around the cabin?<p class="message sent">Go for it. And hey, make sure to check on the passengers while you're at it.<p class=message>Will do. But if I'm not back in 5, send someone to come find me.<p class="message sent">Got it, boss. But hurry back, we have a schedule to keep.<p class=message>Roger that. And thanks for having my back, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. It's always a pleasure flying with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=81341a88-325f-4f79-93c6-fbca9b6b54be.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
