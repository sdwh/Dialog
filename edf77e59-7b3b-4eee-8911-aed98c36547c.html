How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon, sir. I'll be your server today. Have you dined with us before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. But it's been a while. What do you recommend ordering?<p class="message sent">For starters, I recommend our famous clam chowder. It's creamy, warm, and perfect for the rainy weather today.<p class=message>Sounds good, I'll have that. And for the main course?<p class="message sent">Our fresh seafood platter is always a popular choice. You can choose from a variety of clams, crabs, shrimps, and more.<p class=message>That does sound delicious. How long have you been working here?<p class="message sent">Oh, just a few months now. I'm still learning a lot about the different types of seafood we offer.<p class=message>Well, I'm sure you'll learn quickly. Can you tell me where the seafood is sourced from?<p class="message sent">Of course, sir. All of our seafood is sourced locally from the nearby fishing ports. Freshness is our top priority.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I always appreciate restaurants that prioritize using fresh and local ingredients.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, sir. Is there anything else I can help you with, or any other questions you have?<p class=message>No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help and recommendations.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, sir. Enjoy your meal and let me know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eded8b00-a616-4748-8c7f-130ca8611a13.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
