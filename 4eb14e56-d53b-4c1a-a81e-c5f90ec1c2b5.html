It's coming along pretty well, don't you think?<p class=message>Definitely! It's exciting to see it slowly take shape.<p class="message sent">Hey, have you noticed that we never really talk about anything non-work related?<p class=message>Haha, I know. I guess we just love programming too much.<p class="message sent">Well, how about we try something new today? What do you like to do outside of work?<p class=message>Oh, I love playing basketball. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm more of a board game person myself. But I'm always up for trying new things.<p class=message>That's great! We should organize a get-together with the team sometime. I'm sure everyone could use a break from work.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We could have a board game tournament and a mini basketball game. It'll be a fun way to bond with everyone.<p class=message>I like the sound of that. Maybe we could even get some prizes for the winners.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we could do that! And if this app becomes a big hit, we could all go on a team outing to celebrate.<p class=message>I'm already looking forward to that. But for now, let's focus on finishing this app first.<p class="message sent">Right, we can get back to bonding once we hit the App Store.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4eaf801a-e375-44ac-94d5-7ed60d4fcea8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
