You own this lovely restaurant, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. I hope you're enjoying your time at the beach today.<p class=message>Definitely! And speaking of enjoying, I heard your place has some fresh fish dishes. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, we get our seafood delivered daily from the local fishermen. I highly recommend the grilled sea bass or the garlic shrimp linguine.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! How do you know if the seafood you're getting is fresh?<p class="message sent">Well, I can usually tell by the smell and texture, but we also have our suppliers provide us with the catch date and location so we can ensure our customers are getting the freshest possible seafood.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Have you ever had any interesting catches that you've never seen before?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. There have been times when we've received fish that were so unusual that we had to call in a marine biologist to identify them. It's always exciting to try something new and unique.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like quite an adventure for you and your team. Do you have any secret recipes for preparing the seafood that you can share?<p class="message sent">Ha, I wish I could share them with you, but they're top secret. Let's just say that we use a combination of fresh herbs, spices, and a lot of love to create our dishes.<p class=message>Fair enough, I'll just have to trust your expertise. Lastly, do you have any advice for someone who wants to try fishing for the first time?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I would say to do your research on what kind of fish are in season and what bait to use. Most importantly, don't get discouraged if you don't catch anything on your first try. Fishing takes patience, but it's definitely worth it in the end.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice, and for the great conversation. I can't wait to try some of your seafood dishes!<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. I hope you enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=914a8e78-5cd2-4f52-97c5-7cb7ac2dd39b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
