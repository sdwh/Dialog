I'm looking for some fresh flowers to brighten up my living room.<p class=message>Great! We have a wide assortment of flowers. Are you looking for any particular colors or types?<p class="message sent">I love bright and bold colors, especially orange and pink. Do you have anything in those colors?<p class=message>Yes, we have some beautiful pink roses and orange dahlias. They would definitely add a pop of color to your room.<p class="message sent">Those sound perfect. I also need a vase to put them in. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Of course! We have some gorgeous handmade ceramic vases that would complement those flowers nicely.<p class="message sent">That sounds lovely. I'll take the roses and dahlias and one of those ceramic vases.<p class=message>Great! Would you like me to wrap it up for you?<p class="message sent">Yes please, and would you mind including a little card? I'm giving them to a friend as a thank you gift.<p class=message>Of course, we can do that for you. What would you like the card to say?<p class="message sent">Just something simple like "Thank you for all that you do!"<p class=message>Perfect, we'll get that taken care of for you. Is there anything else you need?<p class="message sent">No, that's everything. Thank you so much for your help!<p class=message>It was my pleasure. I hope your friend enjoys the flowers.
