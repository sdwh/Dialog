It's nice to see you again. How have you been?<p class="message sent">Morning, A. I'm doing alright. Just a bit stressed out about this legal matter we're dealing with.<p class=message>I understand. But let's try to alleviate that stress today. Can I offer you some coffee or tea?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! Coffee would be fantastic.<p class=message>Of course, I'll go grab us a cup. Now, let's go over the details of your case. I've been reviewing the documents you provided and wanted to get your thoughts on a few things.<p class="message sent">Okay, sure. What specifically do you need my input on?<p class=message>Well, I wanted to discuss the potential outcomes of settling versus going to trial. I think settling could save you time and money, but ultimately the decision is up to you.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough choice. I don't want to waste any money, but I also don't want to compromise on what's right.<p class=message>I completely understand. We'll weigh all of our options and make the best decision for you. In the meantime, how's your family doing?<p class="message sent">They're good, thanks for asking. My daughter just started soccer practice and she's loving it.<p class=message>That's great to hear. My son is also into soccer. Maybe they can practice together sometime!<p class="message sent">That'd be awesome. Oh, and I almost forgot - I brought in some cookies I baked for you and the team.<p class=message>Wow, thank you so much! I'm sure everyone will appreciate it.<p class="message sent">No problem, it's the least I can do. You guys have been so helpful through all of this.<p class=message>It's our pleasure. We're here to help you navigate through this legal process and achieve the best outcome possible.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b403b400-6bdf-4fcc-adae-fc49b45cecce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
