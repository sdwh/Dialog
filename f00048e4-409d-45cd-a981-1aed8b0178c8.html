Are you from Seoul?<p class="message sent">Good morning, ma'am! Yes, I am. Born and raised in this beautiful city.<p class=message>Oh, that's great! I'm visiting from the States, and I'm excited to see what Seoul has to offer.<p class="message sent">I'm sure you're going to love it here. Seoul has a lot of interesting places to see and things to do.<p class=message>Yes, I've heard about that. Can you recommend some places I should visit apart from the usual tourist spots?<p class="message sent">Well, have you ever heard of the Trick Eye Museum? It's a fun museum that showcases optical illusions and interactive art.<p class=message>No, I haven't. That sounds like a good idea.<p class="message sent">Also, if you're a fan of K-dramas, I suggest you visit the KBS Drama Center. They offer tours and you can even watch a live taping of a drama if you're lucky.<p class=message>Oh wow! I am definitely adding that to my itinerary.<p class="message sent">You should also try some of our street food. Tteokbokki, kimbap, and hotteok are popular choices that are delicious and affordable.<p class=message>I am a big foodie, so I'm excited to try anything and everything.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! I hope you have an amazing time in Seoul.<p class=message>Thank you so much for the recommendations, driver. You've been very helpful.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Just doing my job to ensure your trip is memorable.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eff938fc-68f0-490b-960c-5bb7a7c4cfa4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
