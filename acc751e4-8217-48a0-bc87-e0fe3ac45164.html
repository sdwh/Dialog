It's always a pleasure to be in your presence and in this holy sanctuary.<p class=message>So, how are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">I'm feeling great. This is my favorite place to be on a Sunday morning. What about you, Pastor?<p class=message>I'm feeling blessed, as always. I feel privileged to be a shepherd guiding my flock.<p class="message sent">Well, you have certainly been doing an excellent job. How long have you been a pastor?<p class=message>Thank you so much for your kind words. I have been a pastor for over 20 years now. It's a calling that I'm deeply passionate about.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. I'm sure you've seen a lot of changes over the years.<p class=message>Yes, it's been quite a journey. But the one thing that has remained constant is God's love and grace.<p class="message sent">Speaking of changes, have you noticed the new stained glass window in the back of the church?<p class=message>Yes, it's beautiful, isn't it? It was donated by one of our long-time members. It's a wonderful addition to our church.<p class="message sent">It certainly is. Have you decided on a topic for today's sermon?<p class=message>Yes, I'm going to be talking about forgiveness. It's a challenging topic, but one that I believe is important.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. Forgiveness is something that many of us struggle with.<p class=message>It's a continuous process, but the key is to be open and willing to forgive. It's not easy, but it's worth it.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Pastor, for your wise words. I'm looking forward to your sermon.<p class=message>You're welcome, my friend. Let us continue to pray and reflect on our journey towards forgiveness.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=acbf9729-1d47-455e-8152-21e0811b90ce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
