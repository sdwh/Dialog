How's your homework going?<p class="message sent">It's going well, Dad. Just finishing up this math problem.<p class=message>Math, eh? That was always my favorite subject in school.<p class="message sent">Really? I thought you were more of a history guy.<p class=message>History was interesting, but math just always made sense to me. What problem are you working on?<p class="message sent">It's a word problem about train speeds. I'm trying to figure out how long it will take two trains to meet each other.<p class=message>Oh boy, those can be tough. Did you remember to carry the 1?<p class="message sent">(Laughing) Yes, Dad, I remembered to carry the 1.<p class=message>Good job, kiddo. Keep up the good work.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Dad. Say, do you remember what it was like being in school?<p class=message>Oh yeah, I remember it like it was yesterday. But I don't think I had anywhere near as many distractions as you do nowadays.<p class="message sent">(Eyeing his phone on the desk) You mean like this thing?<p class=message>Exactly. Back in my day, the only distractions we had were the occasional bird outside the classroom window.<p class="message sent">(Chuckling) I guess things have changed quite a bit.<p class=message>Sure have. But one thing that hasn't changed is the importance of getting a good education. So keep at it, kiddo.<p class="message sent">I will, Dad. Thanks for your help.<p class=message>Anytime, son. Now I think I'll go read a book and give you some peace and quiet.<p class="message sent">(Smiling) Sounds good to me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f2cde143-b4ef-4e8f-be8d-1e98c813e431.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
