Can you help me with that?<p class=message>Of course, let's discuss which medication specifically you're taking and what side effects you're experiencing.<p class="message sent">It's a pain relief medication, but it's causing me to feel drowsy and lethargic throughout the day.<p class=message>Ah, it sounds like it could be a common side effect. Have you spoken to your doctor about this?<p class="message sent">Yes, but I'd like to know if there's anything I can do in the meantime to manage it.<p class=message>I would suggest taking the medication at night before bed to help with the drowsiness during the day. Additionally, you could try some natural remedies like chamomile tea before bed to help you sleep better.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea, I'll try that out. Thank you!<p class=message>You're welcome, but it is important to remember to always consult with your doctor when experiencing any medication-related issues.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, I completely agree. Thank you for your help and advice, I appreciate it.<p class=message>It was my pleasure to assist you, have a good day!<p class="message sent">You too, thanks again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=806c0e24-044a-49e6-ae36-9f01e0947bde.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
