I'm ready to board my flight. What should I do first?<p class="message sent">Great to have you here! Before you board, we need to perform some safety checks. Please show me your passport and boarding pass first.<p class=message>Certainly. Here you go. By the way, have you traveled to any exotic places recently?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, not recently. But I have ventured to some wonderful destinations in the past. Have you traveled anywhere special lately?<p class=message>Yes, I just got back from a trip to Bali. The beaches were simply amazing!<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds lovely. Let me just check that you don't have any prohibited items in your luggage, such as liquids or sharp objects.<p class=message>No, I made sure to pack everything according to the airline's guidelines. Hey, what would happen if I accidentally left something prohibited in my bag?<p class="message sent">We would have to remove it and dispose of it properly, unfortunately. We don't want any potential hazards on board.<p class=message>Got it, that makes sense. By the way, is there any way I can upgrade my seat to first class?<p class="message sent">I'm afraid all first-class seats are already taken for this flight. However, I can check if there are any spots left in the economy plus section if you'd like?<p class=message>Hmm, actually, that's okay. I'm fine with my original seat. Oh, and by the way, what's the weather like at our destination?<p class="message sent">It looks like it's going to be a sunny day. Just make sure to wear sunscreen and stay hydrated.<p class=message>Thank you for the heads up! Anything else I should know before boarding?<p class="message sent">Just follow the instructions of the flight attendants and enjoy your flight! Would you like me to help you with your carry-on?<p class=message>No, that's alright, I can manage. Thank you again for your assistance!<p class="message sent">No problem at all, have a safe flight and enjoy your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c41d884b-0124-42a1-9af3-0c7a2b1d6de0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
