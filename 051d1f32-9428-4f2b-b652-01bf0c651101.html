Do you need any help selecting flavors for your dishes? I'm a food flavorist and I could assist you.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, that's great! I'm planning to make a stir-fry dish with pork and vegetables. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message received message-content">Sure. You could try adding some ginger and garlic for a spicy kick, and a dash of soy sauce for that umami flavor.<p class="message sent message-content">Hmmm, sounds good. But I don't want it to be too overwhelming. How much should I add?<p class="message received message-content">For a serving size of four, I would recommend using about one tablespoon of minced garlic and ginger, and a quarter cup of soy sauce.<p class="message sent message-content">Okay, I'll try that. What about for another dish? I'm thinking of making a salad with fresh greens.<p class="message received message-content">Nice choice. To give it a zingy flavor, you could add some lemon zest and a pinch of sea salt. A bit of honey could balance out the tartness too.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds appetizing. How much lemon zest and honey would you recommend?<p class="message received message-content">For a salad that serves four, you could use the zest of one lemon, and about one tablespoon of honey. But of course, feel free to adjust according to your taste!<p class="message sent message-content">Thank you so much. I think I have a better idea of how to enhance my dishes with these flavors.<p class="message received message-content">My pleasure! Don't hesitate to drop by if you need more assistance. Have fun cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=051c42e9-a150-4ae3-a117-d3cb683bd4d1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
