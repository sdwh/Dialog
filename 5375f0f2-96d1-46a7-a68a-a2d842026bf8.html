I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing alright, just trying to get this dough to cooperate with me.<p class="message sent">I hear you, this dough can be tricky sometimes. But once we get it right, it's smooth sailing.<p class=message>That's true. So, what's on the menu for today?<p class="message sent">Today, we have our signature beef noodle soup and a spicy pork stir fry dish.<p class=message>Yum, those both sound delicious. Which one is more popular among the customers?<p class="message sent">It's pretty evenly split, but I would say the beef noodle soup is slightly more popular. People love the hearty broth and the tender beef.<p class=message>Speaking of broth, how do you get your soup to taste so good? Do you have a secret ingredient?<p class="message sent">Well, I can't reveal all my secrets, but I will say that we simmer our broth for hours with a variety of herbs and spices to develop the rich flavor.<p class=message>Sounds like a lot of hard work, but it definitely pays off. I'm excited for our customers to try it.<p class="message sent">Me too. So, have you tried any new recipes lately?<p class=message>Actually, I have. I've been experimenting with a spicy sesame sauce for our cold noodle dish. It's still a work in progress, but I think it's coming along nicely.<p class="message sent">That sounds really interesting. I can't wait to try it. Maybe we can add it as a special dish later this week.<p class=message>That's a great idea. Let's see how it turns out and we'll go from there.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! I'll get back to making these noodles. See you later.<p class=message>See you later, and keep up the good work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=536e28b8-6ea6-47b2-9049-11f90a79ea08.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
