Are you ready for today's diving lesson?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm so excited! I've been looking forward to this for weeks.<p class=message>Great to hear! Let's start with some basic skills like clearing your mask and regulator.<p class="message sent">Okay, but I'm a bit nervous. What if I forget how to do it?<p class=message>Don't worry, I've got you covered. I'll be there with you every step of the way.<p class="message sent">Thanks, that's reassuring. What kinds of fish do you think we'll see down there?<p class=message>Oh, we'll see a lot of colorful fish - parrotfish, angelfish, clownfish, just to name a few.<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing! What about sharks? Will we encounter any?<p class=message>Don't worry, we won't come across any sharks during our lesson. It's too shallow here for them.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. What's the maximum depth we'll be going today?<p class=message>We'll be going to a maximum of 12 meters today. But don't worry, it's not too deep.<p class="message sent">Got it, thanks for letting me know. I don't want to go too deep and freak out.<p class=message>No problem at all. Remember to breathe deeply, stay calm and enjoy the experience.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'll try my best. Is it true that time feels slower underwater?<p class=message>Yes, it's true. You'll feel like you have ample time to execute all your actions correctly.<p class="message sent">Interesting! Can we bring a waterproof camera with us to take photos?<p class=message>Absolutely! You can capture some amazing shots of the coral, fish and other marine life.<p class="message sent">Cool, I'll make sure to bring one. How long will the lesson last?<p class=message>We'll be underwater for about an hour. But, it will feel like time flies.<p class="message sent">Sure, it does seem like a short time. Thank you for answering my questions and for being a great instructor.<p class=message>You're welcome, I'm happy to help. Let's gear up and dive into the reef!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6e33d198-b061-4dd3-84bd-56d3c945f608.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
