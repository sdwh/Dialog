I want to buy a Nintendo Switch.<p class="message sent">Of course, son. I think that's a great idea. Do you have enough money saved up for it?<p class=message>Yes, I saved up enough. I can't wait to play my favorite video games.<p class="message sent">Great, let's head to the store now. Hmm, which one is the Nintendo Switch?<p class=message>It's that one over there, on the shelf. I heard it's really popular.<p class="message sent">Oh, yes, I see it now. Wait a second, the label says "Cisco Switch"?<p class=message>What? That can't be right. What's a Cisco Switch?<p class="message sent">Well, it's not exactly the same thing as a Nintendo Switch. This one is a device that helps to connect multiple networks together.<p class=message>Oh no. That's not what I wanted. I wanted the one that plays games.<p class="message sent">Haha, I figured that. I just wanted to make sure. Let's keep looking for the Nintendo Switch.<p class=message>Thank goodness. I was starting to worry there. Hey, look, there it is! And it comes with a free game too!<p class="message sent">That's great, son. I'm glad we found it. Let's go ahead and buy it.<p class=message>Thank you, dad! You're the best.<p class="message sent">No problem, son. Seeing you happy makes me happy.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2f3ef77d-d51e-44b4-82ad-577e5bbfcdd2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
