You can try some chaat, chole bhature, or even some momos.<p class="message received message-content">Momos? What are those?<p class="message sent message-content">They're a type of dumpling originally from Tibet. You can find them all over Delhi now.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds interesting. I'll definitely give them a try.<p class="message sent message-content">You should also visit the Red Fort and Jama Masjid while you're here.
