It's a standard for information security management, right?<p class=message>That's correct. It's a way to ensure that information and data are protected from unauthorized access or damage.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see, that's interesting. I bet it's quite complex to implement, right?<p class=message>It can be, but it's worth the effort for the sake of security.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. Speaking of which, have you implemented any of the controls yet?<p class=message>Yeah, I have implemented access control, network security, and encryption.<p class="message sent">Wow, you're ahead of me then. I've only implemented risk management and disaster recovery planning.<p class=message>Those are important too. Have you heard of the control category Information security incident management?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's that all about?<p class=message>It's about how to respond to a security incident, such as a data breach, hacking attempt, or virus outbreak.<p class="message sent">Oh, I get it. So it's basically like a plan of action.<p class=message>Yes, exactly. It's important to have it in place, because otherwise, the impact of a security incident can be much worse.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. It's reassuring to know that there are all these controls in place to protect our data.<p class=message>Absolutely. And it's also important for us to stay updated on new security threats and to regularly review and update our controls.<p class="message sent">True. Hey, did you hear about the recent ransomware attack on that big corporation?<p class=message>Yeah, it's pretty scary stuff. Makes me glad we have these controls in place.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Hey, speaking of things in place, have you heard about this new firewall technology?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's new about it?<p class="message sent">It's supposed to be able to detect and block malware in real-time.<p class=message>That's impressive. We should definitely look into it.<p class="message sent">For sure. Thanks for the great chat, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to discuss security control with a fellow professional.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f23515d0-4c2c-47d5-ab76-c8e65235a931.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
