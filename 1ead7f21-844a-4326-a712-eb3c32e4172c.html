How are you doing tonight?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks! How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. It's a beautiful night and we've got some great seafood dishes tonight.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! What's the catch of the day?<p class=message>We have some really fresh shrimp tonight that were caught this morning from the sea.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! Do you recommend any dishes with the shrimp?<p class=message>The shrimp scampi is always a hit, but I also recommend the garlic shrimp skewers.<p class="message sent">Yum, those both sound amazing! What's your personal favorite dish on the menu?<p class=message>Oh, that's a tough one. I would have to say the crab cakes. They're made with lump crab meat and are super flavorful.<p class="message sent">I'll have to try those next time I come in. Have you had any interesting customers lately?<p class=message>Actually, we had a group of tourists in earlier who were trying raw oysters for the first time. It was fun to watch their reactions.<p class="message sent">Haha, I bet that was entertaining! Speaking of oysters, how do you like yours prepared?<p class=message>I'm a classic guy, so I prefer them raw with a squeeze of lemon.<p class="message sent">Nice! Well, let's hope our customers tonight enjoy their meals as much as we do talking about them.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1eab8b8d-5ec3-48d3-b156-29dd517fd19f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
