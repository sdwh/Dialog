Are you excited for your first diving lesson?<p class="message sent">Yes! I'm super excited! Is it difficult?<p class=message>Don't worry! I'll be with you every step of the way. Have you ever worn a wetsuit before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it uncomfortable?<p class=message>Not at all! It might feel a bit tight at first, but it will keep you warm and protected.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. How deep are we going today?<p class=message>We'll start off at around 5 meters and gradually go deeper if you feel comfortable. Are you okay with that?<p class="message sent">Yes, that sounds good to me. What kind of animals will we see down there?<p class=message>So many! There are colorful fish, sea turtles, and even some sharks! But don't worry, they won't bother us.<p class="message sent">Sharks?! Are you serious?<p class=message>Yes, but like I said, they won't harm us. They're more afraid of us than we are of them.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll trust you on that. How long will the lesson last?<p class=message>We'll be in the water for about an hour, but it might feel like just a few minutes! Time flies when you're having fun.<p class="message sent">I'm sure it will be amazing! Thank you for being my instructor.<p class=message>No problem! It's my pleasure. Just remember to breathe normally and enjoy the beauty of the underwater world.<p class="message sent">I will. Thank you for the great advice! Let's dive in!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9c7b22f7-d4f6-4eee-887b-69b856afed6b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
