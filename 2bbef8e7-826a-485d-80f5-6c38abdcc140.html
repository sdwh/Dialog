Welcome to our hotel. How can I assist you tonight?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I was wondering if you could recommend a good place to catch some live jazz nearby?<p class=message>Absolutely! You're in luck. The French Quarter is just a short walk away, and there are plenty of bars and clubs with live jazz.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! Do you have any personal favorites?<p class=message>I highly recommend the Preservation Hall. It's a historic jazz venue with amazing musicians and a great atmosphere.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that's perfect! Do you know what time their shows start?<p class=message>Their shows start at 8pm and 10pm every night. I would suggest getting there a bit early, as it can get crowded.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice. Do they serve drinks there as well?<p class=message>Yes, they do. They serve beer, wine, and cocktails. And if you're looking for some good Cajun food to go with your drinks, I would recommend the Gumbo Shop, also in the French Quarter.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a perfect night out. Thanks for all your help!<p class=message>It's my pleasure. Enjoy your evening and let us know if there's anything else we can do to make your stay more enjoyable.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2bb4f651-aa0c-47b5-9a32-1bd028c17269.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
