It's great to see you here in my office. What brings you in today?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. I'm here because I need your legal expertise. I'm having some issues with my business and I'm not sure what to do.<p class=message>Well, you've come to the right place. Let's sit down and go over what's been going on. Would you like some coffee or tea to start?<p class="message sent">Coffee would be great, thanks. So, A, I heard you're a pretty famous lawyer. Is that true?<p class=message>(laughs) I don't know about famous, but I do my best to provide quality legal services. Now, let's discuss your situation. What exactly is the problem you're facing?<p class="message sent">It's a dispute with one of my suppliers. They claim I haven't been paying them on time, but I have kept my end of the bargain. I'm afraid they'll take legal action against me.<p class=message>I see. Let's take a look at your contract with them and see what we can do. In the meantime, have you thought about sending them a fruit basket or something? Maybe that'll sweeten things up.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I haven't thought about that. Maybe I should try it. But seriously, what's your advice on how to handle this?<p class=message>Well, first things first, we need to review your contract and see what your obligations are. Then we can negotiate with your supplier and try to find a resolution that suits everyone.<p class="message sent">Alright, sounds good to me. By the way, have you ever lost a case before?<p class=message>(smiles) Of course, I'm only human. But I do my best to provide quality legal representation to all my clients. Let's focus on your case for now though.<p class="message sent">(nodding) Alright, let's do that. Thank you for your help, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B. That's what I'm here for. Let me know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=30f064c2-6251-4535-afae-a0f46556b5c6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
