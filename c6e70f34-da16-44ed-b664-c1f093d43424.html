Welcome to the Sydney Opera House. My name is John, and I will be your tour guide today. Do you have any questions about the opera house?<p class="message sent">Hi John, thank you! I am so excited to be here. Could you tell us more about the history of the opera house?<p class=message>Sure, the opera house was designed by a Danish architect, Jorn Utzon. Construction began in 1959, but it took over 14 years to complete due to several challenges. It was finally opened in 1973 by Queen Elizabeth II.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's interesting. What kind of performances are typically held at the opera house?<p class=message>There are a variety of performances including opera, ballet, symphony concerts and even contemporary music events. The opera house is also a popular venue for large conferences.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Could you show me around the famous sails of the opera house?<p class=message>Of course! The sails are made of over 1 million tiles which were specially designed and made in Sweden. They were then shipped here to Australia to be installed on the building. The design is inspired by the sails of a ship on Sydney Harbour.<p class="message sent">It's an amazing design. Are there any secret rooms or hidden locations in the opera house?<p class=message>Well, there's no secret rooms, but there are several backstage areas where only performers and staff can go. Also, the opera house has a private area where VIP guests can enjoy the shows. Would you like to see some photos of these areas?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! Oh, look at that! It's so beautiful. Thank you for showing me around the opera house, John.<p class=message>You're welcome. Have a great time exploring more of the opera house today.
