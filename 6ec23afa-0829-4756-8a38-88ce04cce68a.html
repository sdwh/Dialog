How are you today?<p class="message sent">Hey A! I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks for asking. So, I have reviewed the financial statements you sent me.<p class="message sent">Great! Did everything look in order?<p class=message>For the most part, yes. Although, I did notice a large expense for "team building activities."<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. That was our company retreat, where we went kayaking and had a huge barbecue. It was a lot of fun!<p class=message>It sounds like it! But unfortunately, those kinds of expenses aren't tax-deductible.<p class="message sent">Oh no, really? So what should I do?<p class=message>Don't worry, we can adjust your financial statements to reflect the correct amount. And next time, we'll make sure to keep a closer eye on what kinds of expenses are deductible.<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds good. Thanks for your help, A.<p class=message>No problem at all, B. That's what I'm here for. By the way, have you seen the latest season of that show we were talking about last time?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I finished it last weekend! It was so good. Have you seen it yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've heard amazing things. I'll have to check it out soon.<p class="message sent">Definitely do! Oh, and have you tried that new Thai place down the street? I went there for lunch last week and it was delicious.<p class=message>No, I haven't been there yet. But I do love Thai food. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">Anytime, A! It's always great catching up with you.<p class=message>Same to you, B. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6ec026aa-8d37-4820-b2eb-d5209d628d34.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
