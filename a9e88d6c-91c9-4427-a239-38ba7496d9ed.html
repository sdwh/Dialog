So, what do you feel like eating tonight?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about we go all out and get some fancy steak?<p class=message>Sounds good to me.

Do you have any favorites in mind?<p class="message sent">I was thinking a nice Merlot, but I trust your judgment on this one.<p class=message>Alright, let's ask the waiter for his recommendations.<p class=message>Yes, we'll have two ribeye steaks and a bottle of red wine, please.<p class="message sent">Actually, could you recommend a good soup? The weather is a little chilly tonight.<p class=message>That sounds perfect! We'll have two bowls of tomato soup as well.<p class="message sent">Can't wait to dig in. This is such a great restaurant, the ambiance is so cozy.<p class=message>I agree.
