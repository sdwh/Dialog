How's it going tonight?<p class="message sent">Hey, A. I'm doing pretty good. We've got a lot of customers coming in tonight for some delicious Japanese cuisine and sake.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I just finished making some salmon and tuna nigiri. Would you like to try some?<p class="message sent">Sure, I always enjoy your sushi. It's some of the best in the city.<p class=message>Thank you, B. I also made some takoyaki and tempura. Have you had a chance to try those yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I'm looking forward to it. Your tempura is always crispy and flavorful.<p class=message>I'm glad you think so. Speaking of flavor, have you tried any of the new sake we have in stock?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I just tried the Dassai 45 and it was amazing. Have you tried it yet?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's one of my favorites. I also like the Kubota Senju, it has a nice clean taste.<p class="message sent">Oh, I haven't tried that one yet. I'll have to give it a taste tonight.<p class=message>Definitely do. I also recommend our special tonight, the hamachi sashimi. It's incredibly fresh and buttery.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds delicious. I'll make sure to recommend it to our other customers.<p class=message>Speaking of customers, have you noticed that couple in the corner trying out chopsticks for the first time?<p class="message sent">Yes! They look like they're having a great time but also struggling a bit.<p class=message>Maybe we should go offer some assistance and a few pointers.<p class="message sent">Good idea, let's go make sure they're having a great time.<p class=message>Absolutely. That's what this restaurant is all about, making sure our customers leave happy and satisfied.<p class="message sent">Cheers to that, A.<p class=message>Cheers, B. Let's go make some customers happy.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1b96e932-ee79-4326-8968-9156dc5c1fae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
