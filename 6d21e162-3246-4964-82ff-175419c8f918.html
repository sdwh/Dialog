How's your day going?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It's going pretty well. What brings you to the airline today?<p class=message>I'm working on a project to develop an online booking and boarding app for our airline, and I could really use your database management skills.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A. What do you need from me?<p class=message>Well, I was hoping to discuss some ideas on how we can efficiently design the database to process online bookings and boarding passes.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's see, we could start by creating tables for flights, customers, and reservations.<p class=message>That sounds like a great start. And we'll also need tables for seats, baggage, and boarding passes.<p class="message sent">Right you are, A. How about we make the customer tables more robust by including fields for frequent flyer numbers and loyalty program information?<p class=message>Ooh, good thinking B. And for the flight tables, we could include fields to store arrival and departure times, flight durations, and even aircraft information.<p class="message sent">Yes, and for the reservations tables, we can save information including booking confirmation numbers, flight prices, and payment details.<p class=message>Brilliant, B. With all these tables, how can we ensure that they are streamlined and easy to use?<p class="message sent">We can ensure that by developing a schema that considers the relationships between tables and fields in such a way that they are both intuitive and efficient.<p class=message>Excellent. How about we integrate QR codes and electronic boarding passes that can be scanned by airport staff and users?<p class="message sent">Great idea! We can also integrate additional features like real-time flight tracking, customer feedback, and even loyalty program integration.<p class=message>That's a wonderful thought, B. This is going to be a great app. Thank you for your help.<p class="message sent">No problem! It was great working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6d1fbd74-4673-492e-bd59-0a66b1781fd5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
