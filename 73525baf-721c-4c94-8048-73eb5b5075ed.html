I've been experimenting with some new marinades.<p class=message>Really? Which one is your favorite?<p class="message sent">Definitely the miso and honey glaze. It adds the perfect balance of sweetness and umami.<p class=message>Yum, I'll have to try that next time. Speaking of new things, have you thought about adding some more veggies to our menu?<p class="message sent">Actually, I've been playing around with grilled eggplant and zucchini. They're a hit with our vegetarian customers.<p class=message>That's fantastic! We want to make sure everyone feels welcome and satisfied.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of satisfaction, how about those beef skewers marinated in yakiniku sauce?<p class=message>Ridiculously delicious. Our secret is in the quality of the beef we use.<p class="message sent">True, but I also think the secret is in how evenly we grill them.<p class=message>Thank goodness I invested in a high-quality grill. It's paid off in spades.<p class="message sent">Do you remember when we first opened and barely anyone would give us a chance?<p class=message>Yes, but we both knew that if we kept pushing ourselves and delivering great food, word would get out.<p class="message sent">And it has. We're not just another yakitori bar, we're a destination.<p class=message>This is why I always say cooking and eating should be an adventure. We never stop trying new things and improving ourselves.<p class="message sent">You said it! Now, let's get back to grilling. These skewers aren't going to cook themselves!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=73507de3-8d08-4525-82d9-defb62c61478.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
