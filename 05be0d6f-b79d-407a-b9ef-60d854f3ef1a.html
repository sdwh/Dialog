I've been doing my research and I recommend increasing our server capacity.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds expensive. Is there another option?<p class="message sent message-content">We could implement a load balancer to distribute the requests evenly across multiple servers.<p class="message received message-content">Oh, I see. I'm not too familiar with load balancers. Could you explain it in layman's terms for me?<p class="message sent message-content">Sure thing! It's like having multiple waiters at a restaurant taking orders from customers so that no one waiter gets overwhelmed.<p class="message received message-content">That makes sense! So, do you think this will solve our problem?<p class="message sent message-content">It should definitely help. But we also need to optimize our database to handle the increased traffic.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds like a job for you, B. But I'm sure you'll handle it like a pro!<p class="message sent message-content">I'm up for the challenge! But I'll need a few cups of coffee to power through it.<p class="message received message-content">(laughs) Just make sure you don't overdo it. We don't need you bouncing off the walls!<p class="message sent message-content">(laughs) Don't worry, I'll keep my caffeine intake in check. Thanks for looking out for me, A.<p class="message received message-content">Anytime, B. We make a great team!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=05ba0689-2227-40da-9591-9123244028e0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
