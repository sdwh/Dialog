How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! I'm doing great. Thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too. So, we've been assigned to improve the e-commerce platform of this mall. Do you have any ideas?<p class="message sent">Well, first of all, we should make the website more user-friendly. It's important to have a clean and organized layout.<p class=message>Definitely. We also need to add more product descriptions and images. People want to know what they're buying.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And we should consider adding a wish list feature. It's a great way to entice customers to come back and make a purchase.<p class=message>That's a great idea. What about implementing a chatbot to help users with their purchases?<p class="message sent">Yes! That's a great addition. A chatbot can answer users' questions, recommend products based on their preferences, and ultimately help with conversions.<p class=message>You're right. And we should also add more payment options to make it easier for users to buy products.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We should add Paypal, credit cards, and other popular payment methods.<p class=message>This is going to be an exciting project. I can't wait to see how it turns out.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. With our combined expertise, we're sure to create an amazing e-commerce platform for this mall.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=29e4c3fc-b458-45dd-9429-8869d6228edf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
