They caught a huge shark!<p class=message>Wow, that's incredible. I've never been fishing before. Have you?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But I would like to learn.<p class=message>Maybe we could plan a fishing trip one day. It'll be a great bonding experience.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea, Dad. Can we catch a shark too?<p class=message>Haha, I don't think I'm ready for that yet. We'll start with some smaller fish first.<p class="message sent">Alright, sounds good. Hey Dad, did you know that some fish can change their gender?<p class=message>Really? That's fascinating. I never knew that.<p class="message sent">Yeah, there's this fish called the clownfish that can do it. And they even have a special hierarchy where the largest fish become females.<p class=message>That's really interesting. I'll have to look that up later.<p class="message sent">Speaking of fish, do you have a favorite fish to eat, Dad?<p class=message>Hmm, I really like salmon. It's one of the few fish I can eat without feeling guilty about sustainability.<p class="message sent">I like salmon too. But I also love shrimp. They're so versatile and go well with anything.<p class=message>Shrimp is definitely a good choice. I'm getting hungry just talking about it.<p class="message sent">Me too! Let's see if Mom will make some shrimp for dinner tonight.<p class=message>Haha, we'll have to sweet talk her into it. But let's finish watching this documentary first. Who knows, maybe we'll pick up some tips for our fishing trip.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=33c82982-f1bf-4775-a6d7-6150782b3f08.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
