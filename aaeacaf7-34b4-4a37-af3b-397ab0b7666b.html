What's on the menu for tonight?<p class="message sent">Good evening, A. We have a five-course French meal planned for tonight. It includes escargots, quiche, Coq au Vin, ratatouille, and crème brûlée.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. I can't wait to try them all. Shall I start serving the customers?<p class="message sent">Not yet, A. Let's prepare the dishes first. Can you help me with the escargots?<p class=message>Sure thing, Chef. How can I assist you?<p class="message sent">Please clean the shells thoroughly and brush them with garlic butter. Bake them for five minutes, and then they'll be ready to serve.<p class=message>Sounds easy enough. I'll get right on it. By the way, Chef, have you tried any new recipes lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have been experimenting with a new duck dish. It's marinated with orange juice, honey, and thyme. It's quite delicious, if I do say so myself.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I'll have to try it sometime. What wine would you suggest to pair with the Coq au Vin?<p class="message sent">I would recommend a red Burgundy wine, such as a Pinot Noir. It would complement the strong flavors of the dish perfectly.<p class=message>Sounds like a great suggestion. I'll make sure to let our customers know. How's the ratatouille coming along?<p class="message sent">It's almost ready, A. I just need to add some fresh herbs and let it simmer a bit longer. Would you mind checking on the crème brûlée?<p class=message>No problem, Chef. I'll make sure it's setting properly. By the way, have you seen the new sous chef in the kitchen?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. He seems quite talented. He made a fantastic bouillabaisse the other day.<p class=message>He's definitely a valuable addition to our team. Oh, it looks like our first customers are here. Shall we start serving them?<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it. Bon appétit!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aaeac22e-63b1-4134-b7e7-6a33a62d4439.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
