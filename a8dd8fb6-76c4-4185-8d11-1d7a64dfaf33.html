It's all about securing our data systems from external threats, right?<p class=message>Exactly. I was thinking we should implement it for our company.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a good plan. But, do you think it'll be too much work?<p class=message>I don't think so. We just need to identify the areas that need to be strengthened and take appropriate measures.<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds doable. Do you have any suggestions?<p class=message>First, we need to make sure that all the software and hardware is up to date and patched against known vulnerabilities.<p class="message sent">Right. Then, we need to enforce stronger passwords and multi-factor authentication to protect against unauthorized access.<p class=message>Bingo! We also need to conduct regular audits and risk assessments to ensure that we stay on top of any potential threats.<p class="message sent">I agree. Have you thought about training our employees on best practices for system security?<p class=message>That's a great idea. We need to ensure that everyone understands the importance of maintaining a secure system.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. What about firewalls and encryption?<p class=message>Oh, we definitely need to have those in place. Firewalls will help prevent unauthorized access to our network, and encryption will protect our sensitive data.<p class="message sent">It seems like we have a solid plan. Let's get started on implementing ISO 27001 system hardening.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. It's always better to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to data security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a8d75241-ed41-428a-b5fb-8b079bc8d3a5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
