It's supposed to make using SQL Server a breeze!<p class="message sent">No, I haven't! What's it called?<p class=message>It's called SQL Prompt. It helps with formatting, autocompletion, and code analysis. You should check it out!<p class="message sent">That sounds awesome! I'm definitely going to download it today.<p class=message>Have you run into any issues with the database lately? I noticed some slow queries during testing yesterday.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did notice that too. I optimized the queries this morning and they're running much faster now.<p class=message>Great job! You always seem to know how to speed things up.<p class="message sent">It's all about finding the right indexes and keeping the code clean.<p class=message>You're so good at this stuff. I'm still learning a lot from you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, man! You're pretty good yourself. I'm impressed with the way you've been working with stored procedures lately.<p class=message>Thanks! I guess all those hours of reading Microsoft's documentation are finally paying off.<p class="message sent">Haha, I know the feeling. But seriously, you've been doing some great work. Keep it up!<p class=message>Thanks, I'll do my best. By the way, are you up for grabbing lunch later? There's a new taco place that just opened up across the street.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm down for some tacos.
