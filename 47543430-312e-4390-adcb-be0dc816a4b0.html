How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was great, thanks for asking. I went camping with my family. How about you?<p class=message>It was good too. I finally finished binge-watching a TV show I've been meaning to watch.<p class="message sent">That's cool. So, about our project, do you have any ideas on how to improve the design?<p class=message>Actually, I was thinking of adding a unique feature that will make it stand out from our competitors. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Customers will love it. But how do we make sure it works?<p class=message>I've already started prototyping it. I think it'll work well.<p class="message sent">Awesome. You're such a great engineer. By the way, did you hear about the new coffee shop that just opened up?<p class=message>No, I didn't. Where is it?<p class="message sent">It's just a few blocks away. We should check it out during our lunch break.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. I could really use a good cup of coffee.<p class="message sent">Me too. And maybe some pastries. I heard they have really good ones.<p class=message>I'm sold. Let's go there today.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Can't wait to try it out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4753814e-f131-4f99-bd4b-ee7e6531e7e3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
