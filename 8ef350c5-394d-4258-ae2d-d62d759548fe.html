How's it going?<p class="message sent">It's going great, A! How about you?<p class=message>I'm pretty good, too. So I heard we're here to discuss optimizing the school's network system. Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Well, one idea is to upgrade our networking hardware to improve speed and efficiency.<p class=message>Ah, yeah, that sounds like a good plan. We should probably look into which hardware can provide the best performance for its cost.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Another suggestion could be to implement a guest network to lighten the load on our main network.<p class=message>I hadn't thought of that, but it could definitely reduce congestion. We could also incorporate a content filtering system for added security.<p class="message sent">Good idea. Our students' online safety should always be a priority. And maybe a network usage tracking system for monitoring bandwidth usage of each device would be beneficial.<p class=message>Right, that would allow us to better allocate resources and ensure the network is running smoothly. Hey, do you remember when the network crashed during finals week a couple of years ago?<p class="message sent">Oh, don't remind me! That was a nightmare. We definitely want to avoid that scenario in the future.<p class=message>Haha, yeah, let's make sure that never happens again. So, what's the timeline for implementing these changes?<p class="message sent">We should finalize the plan and start making the necessary purchases within the next few weeks.<p class=message>Sounds good. I think this will be a significant improvement for the school. Thanks for your input, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always a pleasure working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8eef8cfa-37ee-45e9-a70d-8174cc449eb2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
