I've been able to make some good progress over the past few days.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Is there anything I can do to help?<p class="message sent">Actually, there is something. I'm having trouble with one of the software programs. Maybe you can give me some tips or tricks to make it easier?<p class=message>Of course. I'd be happy to help. Why don't we schedule a time later this week to tackle that issue together?<p class="message sent">That would be great. Thanks for your help.<p class=message>No problem.
