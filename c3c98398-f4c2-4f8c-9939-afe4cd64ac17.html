I've been using a few open source programs myself. Have you tried any?<p class=message>Not really, I'm not too familiar with them. What have you been using?<p class="message sent">Well, there's a great open source browser called Firefox. It's super customizable and has a ton of cool extensions.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard of Firefox. I'll have to check it out. What else do you have?<p class="message sent">Another one of my favorites is LibreOffice. It's a free alternative to Microsoft Office and has all the same features.<p class=message>Wow, I didn't know there were free alternatives to Microsoft Office. That's really cool.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and there's also GIMP, which is a free and open source image editor. It's pretty powerful once you get the hang of it.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting. I've been using Adobe Photoshop, but I might give GIMP a try.<p class="message sent">Definitely check it out. You can save a lot of money by using open source software instead of paying for expensive programs.<p class=message>That's a good point. Do you know of any other open source programs I should try?<p class="message sent">There's so many out there it's hard to list them all, but those are some of my favorites. Do you have any programs you'd recommend?<p class=message>Not really, I've mostly been using the standard programs that come with my computer. But I'll definitely consider trying some open source options now.<p class="message sent">Great! Let me know if you have any questions or need any help getting started with any of them.<p class=message>Will do. Thanks for the recommendations!<p class="message sent">No problem. I'm always happy to spread the word about open source software.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c3bf0ff0-ae62-4b9a-85b5-7be5c9769d29.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
