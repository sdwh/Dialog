So, we need to start writing the audit plan for ISO 27001.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. It's always a bit of a challenge, but it's also really important to get it right.<p class=message>Absolutely, we want to make sure that we're covering all the bases, but we don't want to be too overwhelming either.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we definitely don't want people to be falling asleep while they're reading it or feeling like they can't possibly comply with everything we're asking for.<p class=message>I agree. Maybe we could try to make it a little more engaging? Like, should we include some funny examples or anecdotes?<p class="message sent">Haha, that's an interesting thought. But we also have to be careful not to undermine the seriousness of the document.<p class=message>Of course, but I think adding a little humor could actually help people remember the guidelines better.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's give it a try then. How about including a section on how not to let your coffee cup near your computer?<p class=message>Ha, that's a great start. We'll also add a section on the importance of taking a break to stretch your legs and avoid getting "computer butt".<p class="message sent">"Computer butt"? I don't think I've heard that term before.<p class=message>Yeah, it's when you've been sitting at your desk for too long and your butt starts to feel numb. We don't want anyone suffering from that!<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. Well, these are definitely some unexpected topics for an audit plan, but let's see if they make it a little more memorable for people.<p class=message>Agreed. We'll have to make sure to balance the humor with the seriousness of the security risks though.<p class="message sent">Definitely, we don't want people to overlook any of the important guidelines. But I think we can make it interesting and impactful at the same time.<p class=message>Yes, let's give it a shot!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b9f3f818-2d42-4fcb-b7e7-6c0f55b2fc85.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
