How about you?<p class=message>I'm still working on it. Was it difficult to navigate?<p class="message sent">Not really, I found everything I needed pretty easily. But I did notice a couple of broken links.<p class=message>Broken links? Uh-oh, we better get those fixed ASAP.<p class="message sent">Definitely. But overall, the website looks great.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Did you have any trouble with the login process?<p class="message sent">No, it was straightforward. I did have to reset my password, though.<p class=message>Ah, the classic password dilemma. How was the password reset process?<p class="message sent">It was pretty painless, actually. But it did take a few minutes to receive the password reset email.<p class=message>Got it. How about the mobile version of the site?<p class="message sent">I checked it out briefly and it seems to work fine, but I didn't dive too deep into it.<p class=message>Still, it's good to know that it's mobile friendly. Did you run into any bugs?<p class="message sent">Just the broken links that I mentioned earlier. Other than that, it was mostly smooth sailing.<p class=message>Great. I'm going to finish up the testing today so hopefully we can launch soon.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Let me know if you need any help with anything.<p class=message>Will do, thanks for your help with everything.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1dbde7a1-8c7f-427a-9137-0fe2431bac0b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
