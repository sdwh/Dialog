How's it going?<p class="message sent">Great, thanks! Just trying to figure out how to optimize the backend for our system.<p class=message>Yeah, I've been working on the frontend and I think it's turning out pretty good.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! I'm still trying to wrap my head around some of the data structures we need to implement.<p class=message>Have you tried using any libraries or frameworks?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been experimenting with a few, but I'm trying to avoid using too many third-party dependencies.<p class=message>I see, that makes sense. Have you seen the design specs for the UI yet?<p class="message sent">Yeah, they look really sleek and modern. I think we can definitely make it happen.<p class=message>Awesome! I'll make sure to keep you posted on any changes I make on the frontend.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate it. By the way, have you tried the new coffee place down the street?<p class=message>Oh yeah, I went there yesterday. The latte was amazing!<p class="message sent">That's great to hear, I'll have to check it out tomorrow.<p class=message>Definitely worth it. So, what do you think about adding some emojis to the UI?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think it could be a nice touch. Which ones did you have in mind?<p class=message>Maybe the smiley face and the thumbs up? They're pretty universal.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that sounds good. Let's give it a shot.<p class=message>Sweet. Well, I better get back to coding. Catch you later, B.<p class="message sent">See you later, A. And let me know if you need any help on the backend.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a576bee9-1ac2-4a2f-afd8-19bed47b7df1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
