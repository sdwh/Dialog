By the way, the new decor looks fantastic. Our customers are gonna love it!<p class="message sent">Glad you liked it! I tried to give it a nice maritime feel.

Your secret ingredients always make our dishes stand out!<p class="message sent">Haha, thanks! How about we add some mussels to the pasta dish today, make it more interesting?<p class=message>Brilliant idea! And maybe we can offer some wine from the local vineyards to go with it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Speaking of which, have you tried the new recipe for our homemade tartar sauce? Goes great with the fried calamari!<p class=message>Oh, I heard about that from one of our regulars. Can't wait to try it out.<p class="message sent">And you know what, let's change things up a bit for today's special - let's do a seafood paella!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds fantastic. Our customers will definitely be impressed.<p class="message sent">Happy to help out! As always, it's a pleasure working with you.<p class=message>Same here, B. We make a great team.
