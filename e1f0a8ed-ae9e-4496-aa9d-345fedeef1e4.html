Welcome to our Japanese restaurant. My name is A and I will be your sushi chef tonight.<p class="message sent">Hi there! My name is B and I will be your sake sommelier. I think our guests are very lucky to have both of us serving them tonight!<p class=message>I agree! We have a lot of delicious sushi and snacks on the menu tonight. What kind of sushi do you prefer?<p class="message sent">I personally love nigiri sushi, but I'm also a big fan of maki rolls with tempura shrimp. What about you?<p class=message>My favorite is the salmon sashimi. It's so fresh and melts in your mouth. But I also love making the tamago (egg) sushi. It's like a little sweet omelette on top of rice.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! On the drink side, we have a great selection of sake for our guests to choose from. Do you have a favorite?<p class=message>Yes, I really like the Junmai Ginjo. It has a light and fruity taste that pairs well with sushi.<p class="message sent">That's a good choice. For those who prefer something lighter, we also have a great selection of Japanese beers and non-alcoholic beverages.<p class=message>Speaking of non-alcoholic beverages, have you tried the matcha latte?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's one of our most popular drinks. The matcha flavor is really authentic and it's a great way to end a meal.<p class=message>Absolutely. And for those with a sweet tooth, we have some delicious mochi ice cream in various flavors.<p class="message sent">I love the green tea flavor. It's the perfect combination of sweet and bitter.<p class=message>And don't forget about the Japanese-style cheesecake. It's so fluffy and light, it's like eating a cloud.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's a great description. Overall, I think we have a great selection of food and drink for our guests tonight. Let's make sure they have a great experience.<p class=message>Agreed! Let's get started.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e1ee2b4d-f830-4102-ac6e-4e6ea89a4d37.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
