I hope you're doing well?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am, thank you. So you're the pilot?<p class=message>Yes, that's correct. My name is Jack. Before we take off, I have to check that you've got your seatbelt on.<p class="message sent">No worries. I've already put it on.<p class=message>Excellent. While we're in the air, do you have any plans for entertainment?<p class="message sent">Well, I brought a book with me. But, I might just take a nap if I get too bored.<p class=message>You know, some people have told me they get nervous before flying. Are you feeling okay?<p class="message sent">To be honest, I am a bit nervous. But I trust that we'll get there safely.<p class=message>I understand that. It's a pretty common feeling. We're trained for these kinds of situations.<p class="message sent">That's reassuring, thank you.<p class=message>Alright, now let's go over some safety features of the plane. If anything happens, oxygen masks will come down. Just place one on your face, and breathe normally.<p class="message sent">Got it.<p class=message>We've also got flotation devices in case of a water landing. But don't worry too much about that, our flight is a short one.<p class="message sent">I see.<p class=message>Before we taxi out onto the runway, is there anything else I can help you with?<p class="message sent">No, that's all, thank you for everything, captain.<p class=message>You're welcome, and don't worry, I'll get us there just fine.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b4c1d573-a06e-429f-ae92-55613a6f590e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
