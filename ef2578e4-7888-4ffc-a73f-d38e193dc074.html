How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was fantastic, A! I tried out a new recipe for macarons - they turned out great.<p class=message>That's amazing. Your pastries are always so delicious, and my chocolates pair perfectly with them.<p class="message sent">Yes, our collaboration has been a hit with the locals. What do you have planned for the week?<p class=message>I actually just got a request for a chocolate sculpture of the Eiffel Tower for a special event. It's going to be quite the challenge!<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like a fantastic opportunity to showcase your talent. I've got a few wedding cake orders I need to work on, and I also plan on experimenting with some new flavors.<p class=message>It's always great to expand our repertoire. By the way, have you tried the new coffee at the cafe down the street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had the chance yet. Is it worth trying out?<p class=message>Definitely. They roast their own beans and the aroma is just heavenly. It would be a great addition to our desserts.<p class="message sent">Sounds like we should make a trip there this afternoon then. I could use a caffeine boost to get through my orders!<p class=message>Haha, I know the feeling. Let's say around 3 pm? And bring a notepad, we can brainstorm some new ideas together.<p class="message sent">Perfect. It's always great bouncing ideas with you, A. I can't wait to see what delicious creations we can come up with.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ef253c23-5a5f-43ca-b77d-77e68bb27090.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
