It's nice to meet you. So, what experience do you have in developing smart home systems?<p class="message sent">Hey, A. Same here. I have worked on a few projects involving sensors, smart lights, and thermostats. How about you?<p class=message>Well, I have a lot of experience in software development, but not so much in IoT. But I'm excited to learn from you.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. So, we need to decide on what features we want in this system. What do you suggest?<p class=message>Hmm, how about we start with the basics like temperature control, lighting, and security? And we can add more features as we go.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. What platforms do you think we should use for the software and hardware?<p class=message>For software, I suggest we use Java or Python. And for hardware, how about we use Raspberry Pi or Arduino?<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Do you prefer cloud or edge computing for data processing?<p class=message>I think cloud computing would be better because it offers more scalability and better data security.<p class="message sent">Good point. Let's also consider user experience. How do you think we can make it simplified for our customers?<p class=message>We can have an intuitive user interface with voice and mobile app control. And also have automated actions based on user preference and routines.<p class="message sent">Perfect. And we can also integrate third-party devices and services to make it more versatile.<p class=message>Exactly. And when do you think we can have a working prototype ready?<p class="message sent">Let's aim for in a few months. I'm excited to work on this with you, A.<p class=message>Likewise, B. This is going to be a fun and exciting project.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9efe7a90-dc77-4959-aa78-dd7a32361858.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
