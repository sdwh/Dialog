I'm the marketing specialist for this university. How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you. I have some questions about student enrollment. Can you provide some information about the process?<p class=message>Sure thing! I'd be happy to help. What specific questions do you have?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm interested to know more about the admission requirements and scholarships available.<p class=message>Of course. For admission requirements, we require transcripts, test scores, and a personal essay for our undergraduate programs. And for scholarships, we have a range of options available based on academic achievement, financial need and more. Have you filled out the FAFSA yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. How about the international studentsâ€™ admission process?<p class=message>For international students, we have additional requirements such as proof of English proficiency and a copy of their passport. They also need to complete a visa application to study in the United States.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. I'm glad this university provides support for international students.<p class=message>Yes, we pride ourselves on our diverse community. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the enrollment process?<p class="message sent">How about housing options? Do you have on-campus housing available for students?<p class=message>Absolutely. We have a variety of on-campus housing options available for our students, including traditional dormitories and apartment-style living. We also have off-campus housing options that we can assist you with, if you prefer.<p class="message sent">That's great. Thanks so much for your help today. I'm excited to apply to this university.<p class=message>You're welcome! We're excited to have you apply.
