It's an IoT smart home system!<p class="message sent">Of course, I'm already excited to get started. What's our first step?<p class=message>Well, we need to figure out which devices we want to make compatible with our system.<p class="message sent">Right, the more devices we can integrate, the better the user experience will be. I think lighting and temperature control should be top priorities.<p class=message>Good idea. How about voice activation? Do you think it's necessary to have that feature in our system?<p class="message sent">Definitely. People are always looking for ways to make their lives easier, and being able to control their home with just their voice is a big part of that.<p class=message>Okay, I'll add that to our list. What about security features?<p class="message sent">We need to make sure our system is secure, so let's make sure we use strong encryption and have a way to remotely monitor and control access.<p class=message>Perfect. How about pricing? We want to make our system accessible to as many people as possible.<p class="message sent">I think we can offer different packages with varying levels of features at different price points. That way, people can choose what works best for them and their budgets.<p class=message>Great idea. What about the underlying technology we'll be using?<p class="message sent">We'll need to decide on a platform and tools to use for development. I suggest we go with open source technology to keep costs down and make it easier for other developers to contribute.<p class=message>Sounds like a good plan. Let's also prioritize user experience, making sure our interface is easy to navigate and intuitive.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And let's also make sure we leave room for future updates and additions to the system.<p class=message>Makes sense. Okay, we've got a solid plan in place. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b9d77d69-4198-45bd-869b-555696e259ea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
