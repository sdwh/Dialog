Are you enjoying working in the seafood restaurant?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm enjoying it a lot. The atmosphere is great, and the seafood is so fresh!<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. Talking about fresh seafood, have you tried the octopus dish we have on our menu?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it good?<p class=message>It's amazing! And it's also quite interesting since it's a live octopus that is cut and eaten right in front of you.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that sounds adventurous! I'll definitely have to try it next time.<p class=message>You should. Speaking of adventurous, have you tried the sea urchin sushi yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I'm not sure if I would like the taste.<p class=message>Well, you know what they say, don't knock it till you try it. And who knows, it might just become your new favorite!<p class="message sent">You're right, I'll give it a try.<p class=message>Great. Meanwhile, can you check on table 8 for me? The customers have been waiting for their oysters for a while now.<p class="message sent">Sure, no problem. (after a while) The oysters were a hit! They said they never had such fresh and delicious ones before.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Keep up the good work, B. We have a lot of satisfied customers thanks to you.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. I really appreciate it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3a10fe78-070e-4257-a6b8-4c16894daf51.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
