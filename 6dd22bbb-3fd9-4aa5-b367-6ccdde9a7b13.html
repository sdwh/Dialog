I'm excited to learn how to pair different types of tea with food today!<p class="message sent">Good morning A, I'm glad you could join us. We've prepared a variety of dishes to pair with the different tea that we'll be tasting today.<p class=message>That sounds wonderful! Which type of tea should we start with?<p class="message sent">Let's start with a light green tea to cleanse our palate. We have some steamed dumplings and a light salad to pair with it.<p class=message>Mmm, that sounds refreshing. What's next?<p class="message sent">Now, we'll move onto a darker oolong tea to pair with our grilled fish dish. The richness of the oolong will complement the smokiness of the fish.<p class=message>That's a great idea! What's after that?<p class="message sent">We'll finish with a robust black tea to pair with our dessert, a chocolate tart. The tea will balance out the sweetness of the chocolate.<p class=message>I can't wait to try it all! Do you have any advice for someone who wants to start pairing tea with their meals at home?<p class="message sent">Definitely! Start by choosing a tea that you enjoy drinking on its own, and then experiment with different dishes to see what pairs well together. Don't be afraid to mix and match!<p class=message>That's great advice, thank you so much for sharing. This has been such an enjoyable experience, and I'm looking forward to using these new skills at home.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that, A. It was a pleasure having you here today. Don't hesitate to come back again and try more pairings in the future!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6dd22742-21b0-49a5-9e67-181409621dc7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
