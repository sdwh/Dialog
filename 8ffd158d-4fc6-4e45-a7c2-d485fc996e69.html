How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too. So what do you have for me today? Any new and exciting desserts?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually I have been working on a new mango pudding recipe. It's very popular in Hong Kong and I think it would be a hit here too.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds delicious! You have to let me try it later.<p class="message sent">Of course, I will bring some later. So how have the dim sum sales been lately?<p class=message>They've been steady, but not as busy as I would like. Maybe we can offer some lunch specials to attract more customers.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. How about a lunch combo that comes with a small bowl of our famous egg tarts and a tea or coffee?<p class=message>Sounds perfect! We can advertise it on our social media pages and see if it gets any traction.<p class="message sent">Great plan! Oh, and by the way, I noticed we're running low on red bean paste for the sesame balls.<p class=message>Thanks for reminding me. I'll place an order for it today. You always keep me in line, B.<p class="message sent">Ha, no problem at all. We make a great team!<p class=message>Yes, we do. I'm so glad we partnered up to offer the best of both worlds: authentic dim sum and tasty desserts.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's always a pleasure working with you, A.<p class=message>Likewise, B. Let's keep up the good work and make our customers happy.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8ffaf1b6-bb45-48aa-a8fa-600bd2f82c31.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
