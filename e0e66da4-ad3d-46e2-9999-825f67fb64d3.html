And I am eager to bring some of the delicious Okinawan food back to our restaurant.<p class="message sent">Have you tried the Okinawan soba yet? It's a little different from regular soba, but it's so tasty!<p class=message>No, I haven't yet. I'll definitely have to give it a try.<p class="message sent">And have you tried the awamori? It's a traditional Okinawan distilled liquor.<p class=message>Actually, I tried it last night at the hotel bar. It was quite strong!<p class="message sent">That's right, it can have a high alcohol content, but it goes perfectly with some of the local dishes.<p class=message>I'm excited to experiment with some of the flavors and ingredients we learn about today.<p class="message sent">Oh, me too. There are so many unique flavors and techniques that we can incorporate into our drinks and food.<p class=message>I'm glad we came on this trip. It's really inspiring to see how other cultures approach their cuisine.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. We can learn so much from our travels and bring new ideas back to the restaurant.<p class=message>Speaking of which, what dish or drink are you most excited to try making back home?<p class="message sent">I think I want to try and make a yuzu cocktail. The citrus flavor is so refreshing and unique.<p class=message>Nice! And for me, I want to try and make some Okinawan-style taco rice. It's a dish that combines taco and rice, and it's delicious!<p class="message sent">That sounds like a fun challenge. Good luck with that!<p class=message>Thanks, and good luck experimenting with the drinks. Let's make our guests fall in love with Okinawan cuisine!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e0e4ef4f-4daa-4f44-8be5-3b07e49dabb8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
