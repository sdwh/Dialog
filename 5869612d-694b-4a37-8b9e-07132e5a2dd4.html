Do you go there often?<p class="message sent">Not really, but I know the roads like the back of my hand. It'll be a long journey, so feel free to take a nap.<p class=message>Haha, I wish I could, but I'm too excited for the wedding. Have you ever been to one?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I have. It's always a good time. But you know what's more fun? Being the driver because you get to people-watch and hear all their stories.<p class=message>That's true! Speaking of stories, do you have any crazy tales from driving in the city?<p class="message sent">Let me tell you about this one time when a group of clowns hopped in my cab. They were headed to a birthday party and they had so many balloons that they almost couldn't fit inside.<p class=message>Hahaha, that sounds like something out of a movie!<p class="message sent">You never know what's going to happen on the road. That's what makes the journey so exciting.<p class=message>I 100% agree! What's the most challenging aspect of being a cab driver?<p class="message sent">Dealing with traffic is pretty challenging. Moscow can get pretty busy, especially during rush hour. But good music and good conversation always make it better. Speaking of music, do you have any favorite songs?<p class=message>I'm always up for some pop music! Do you have a radio in the car?<p class="message sent">Of course! Let me put some tunes on for us. How about some classic Britney Spears?<p class=message>That sounds perfect! This is going to be a fun ride. Thanks for being such a friendly driver.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=58690649-c13d-4910-bbb4-aa6ac7327178.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
