Thanks for being here today.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Anytime I can help out with information security, count me in!<p class=message>So, we're here to discuss how we can protect national secrets. Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Well, the obvious answer is strong encryption. We can also implement stricter access controls.<p class=message>Yeah, that makes sense. But human error is always a factor. What if someone accidentally leaks sensitive information?<p class="message sent">Ah, good point. We need to emphasize the importance of employee awareness and training. And always have a contingency plan in case of a breach.<p class=message>Agreed. And we also need to stay up-to-date with the latest security technologies and threats.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We can't afford to let our guard down. Hackers and cybercriminals are always coming up with new methods.<p class=message>On a lighter note, have you heard about that hacker who broke into a bank's computer system and left a message demanding a ransom in emojis?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah! I couldn't tell if it was funny or concerning. But it just shows how tech-savvy criminals are becoming.<p class=message>Haha, definitely. And speaking of emojis, have you seen the new ones they added? My favorite is the face with tears of joy.<p class="message sent">I know, right? It's a classic one. But personally, I'm a fan of the mind-blown face. It perfectly captures my reaction to some of the stuff I see in my work.<p class=message>Haha, same here. Okay, let's get back to business. With your expertise in network security and my knowledge in information security, I think we can come up with a solid plan to protect national secrets.<p class="message sent">I agree, A. It's great to work with someone who is equally passionate about security. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dfaa4abd-f23e-488c-b4bf-09466b0eb9ba.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
