How was everyone's weekend?<p class="message sent">It was great! I went on a road trip with my family.<p class=message>That sounds like fun! Did you have any interesting pit stops?<p class="message sent">We stopped at a place that claimed to have the best donuts in the state. They were pretty good, but I think I've had better.<p class=message>Haha, well it's the experience that counts, right? Okay, let's get started with our stand up. B, how are your tasks coming along?<p class="message sent">They are going smoothly. I should be able to finish my part by the end of the week.<p class=message>Awesome! And what about you, C? Any updates on your end?<p class=message>Great job, C! And D, how about you?<p class=message>Excellent. Keep up the good work, team. Anyone have any concerns or questions before we wrap up?<p class="message sent">Actually, I do have a question. Has anyone tried the new caf√© down the street? Their coffee is fantastic!<p class=message>Haha, no I haven't tried it yet. But thanks for the heads up, B. Alright, let's call it a day.
