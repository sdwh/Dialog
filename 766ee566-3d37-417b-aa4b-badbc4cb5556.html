How's it going?<p class="message sent">Pretty good, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. Say, I was wondering if you could give me a hand with something.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, what do you need help with?<p class=message>I'm trying to figure out what type of SQL Server licensing we should get for our team.<p class="message sent">Ah, that's a good question. Have you looked into the different options?<p class=message>Yes, but the information is a bit overwhelming. Would you mind giving me a rundown?<p class="message sent">No problem. There are a few different options, including per-core licensing and server/CAL licensing. Which one do you think would work best for us?<p class=message>Honestly, I'm not sure. Could you give me a bit more information on each one?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Per-core licensing charges you based on the number of processor cores that your SQL Server running on, while the server/CAL licensing model charges you based on the number of servers running SQL Server, and the number of users or devices that will be accessing SQL Server.<p class=message>Interesting. I think I prefer the server/CAL licensing model, as it seems more flexible. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That's definitely a good choice. Just make sure you're aware of all the costs involved, including the cost of additional CALs if you need to add more users.<p class=message>Thanks for the heads up. I'll keep that in mind.<p class="message sent">No problem. Anything else you need to know?<p class=message>Not at the moment, but I might have more questions later. Thanks for your help!<p class="message sent">Of course, anytime. Glad I could be of assistance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=766c6bfd-037f-4dc6-add1-53d2e666d297.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
