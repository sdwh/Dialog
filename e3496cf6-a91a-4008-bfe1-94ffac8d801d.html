I'm really excited to be here with you, the game developer of our new sci-fi game. What's the game about?<p class="message sent">Hey there, A! Thanks for having interest in our game. The game's about a team of space adventurers on a mission to explore a distant planet and save the world from an alien invasion.<p class=message>Oh wow, that sounds amazing! What sort of gameplay can we expect?<p class="message sent">Well, it's an action-packed first-person shooter game with a lot of exploration involved. You'll have your own spaceship to upgrade and travel through space, and you can even team up with other players to accomplish the mission.<p class=message>That's really cool! Will there be any big boss battles?<p class="message sent">Of course! There'll be tons of big bosses with unique abilities and weapons to challenge players. Plus, players will gain more weapons, upgrades, and perks as they progress through the game.<p class=message>Sweet. How many levels can we expect?<p class="message sent">It's quite a lengthy game, so there will be around 30 levels with different environments, objectives, and enemies to encounter.<p class=message>That's going to take me some time to complete. Will there be a multiplayer mode?<p class="message sent">Yes, there will be a cooperative multiplayer mode that allows you and your friends to play together in the main campaign. There's even a competitive multiplayer mode where you can face off against other players on different planets.<p class=message>I can't wait to explore the universe with my friends! When will the game be released?<p class="message sent">We're hoping to release it at the end of the year, in time for the holidays. We'll keep you updated on social media and our official website.<p class=message>Great! I'll be sure to keep an eye out for it. Thanks for giving me a preview of the game, B!<p class="message sent">Thanks for joining me. It was great!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e343da07-5739-4d1c-a0fc-a3b067715b5f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
