You must be the climber I'm going to be photographing today. What's your name?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, I’m B. Nice to meet you. I’m excited to get some awesome shots today!<p class=message>Absolutely! I can't wait to see what you're capable of. Have you climbed here before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but not as much as I’d like to. The view is always worth the climb though!<p class=message>That's for sure. Alright, let's start getting ready. I want to get some shots of you climbing up that rock face over there.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me get my gear on. Hey, have you ever been climbing before?<p class=message>Not really. I've been hiking, but I haven't had the chance to try climbing yet. How about you?<p class="message sent">Climbing is my life. There's nothing quite like scaling a beautiful rock face.<p class=message>It definitely looks like fun. Do you prefer bouldering or wall climbing?<p class="message sent">I like both, but bouldering is my favorite. It’s a good way to build my strength and technique.<p class=message>Sounds like a great way to stay in shape. How long have you been doing this?<p class="message sent">I’ve been climbing for almost eight years now. It’s addicting!<p class=message>Wow, that's a long time. I can definitely see why it's addicting. Alright, let's get some shots before the sun sets.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Just point me in the right direction.<p class=message>You got it.
