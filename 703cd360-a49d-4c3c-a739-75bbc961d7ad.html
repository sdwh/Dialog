May I know how many are in your party and what dishes you'll be having?<p class="message sent">Good evening! My party consists of six people and we will be having a selection of seafood, steak, and pasta dishes.<p class=message>Sounds delightful! Let me recommend a white wine to pair with your seafood dishes. Our Chardonnay is a popular choice amongst our customers.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. What about the steak and pasta dishes?<p class=message>For the steak, I would suggest a red wine like our Merlot to complement the meat's robust flavor. As for the pasta, our Pinot Grigio would be an excellent choice.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendations. How about for those who prefer sweeter wines?<p class=message>Our Riesling would be fitting for those who prefer sweeter-tasting wines. It's a perfect match for our seafood dishes too!<p class="message sent">Great! We'll go with your suggestions. By the way, do you have any interesting stories about wines you'd like to share?<p class=message>Actually, I have a fun one. In the early 1800s, a French winemaker noticed that his champagne was turning pink. He thought it was because the devil was turning the wine into blood. Turned out, it was just a type of grape that turned the wine pink!<p class="message sent">Wow, that's quite a story! Thank you for sharing it with us.<p class=message>You're welcome! And before I forget, enjoy the complimentary bottle of wine on us. We hope you have a wonderful dining experience!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=703ae76c-bc70-4d23-9f2b-a57c032103e2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
