Can you help me out?<p class="message sent">Yes, of course! Do you know which airline you were traveling with?<p class=message>Yes, I was flying with Delta Airlines.<p class="message sent">Alright. In that case, you need to proceed to the baggage claim area located on the lower level. There are signs along the way, but feel free to ask me any questions you may have.<p class=message>Thank you for that. By the way, do you know how long it usually takes for the bags to come out?<p class="message sent">It can be hard to say for sure, but on average it takes about 15-20 minutes. However, if it has been longer than that, feel free to check with one of our representatives to see if there are any delays or issues.<p class=message>Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Is there anything else I should know about getting my bags?<p class="message sent">Just be sure to have your baggage claim ticket on hand, as it will be required for identification purposes. When you see your bag, check to make sure it's yours and then head on out.<p class=message>Great, thanks for letting me know. You've been incredibly helpful.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. That's what we're here for. Have a safe and enjoyable trip! And don't hesitate to ask for any further assistance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6e3fbe69-61d8-43db-9eca-6c90bf9405db.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
