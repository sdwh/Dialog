It's not giving me a break. What about you?<p class=message>I'm building a new feature for our client using Ruby on Rails. It's been challenging but exciting.<p class="message sent">Ruby on Rails is a fantastic framework, but it can be frustrating sometimes.<p class=message>Yeah, especially when it comes to migrations. It takes forever to run them.<p class="message sent">That's true, but it's still better than writing SQL queries manually.<p class=message>Absolutely. Have you tried the new Rails 7 features? They're pretty cool.<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard about Actionable Errors, which makes debugging easier.<p class=message>That's right. And the new Modularization feature is also promising. It helps segregate code efficiently.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to try it out. But I think it's time for us to take a break and grab some coffee.<p class=message>Sounds like a great idea. Do you want to try out that new caf√© down the street?<p class="message sent">Sure, let's check it out. I heard they have excellent pastries too.<p class=message>Yum, I'm sold. Let's go!<p class="message sent">Perfect. I think it's essential to take a breather and unwind once in a while, especially when we're dealing with complex code.<p class=message>Absolutely. Brain breaks are crucial. Let's enjoy our coffee and pastry and come back with fresh ideas.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ca828d6d-f76f-447f-94ee-4a3d50ef06d4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
