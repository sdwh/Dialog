What brings you to the administrative office today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm here to discuss some matters regarding our students' affairs.<p class=message>Sure, let's talk about it. What can I assist you with?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm quite amused by the recent trend in our campus where students are starting to bring their pets to class.<p class=message>Really? That's interesting. Is there a problem with the pets?<p class="message sent">Not really. We just need to set some guidelines to make sure that both the students and their pets are not disrupting the class.<p class=message>I see. What kind of guidelines are you thinking about?<p class="message sent">Well, we could limit the number of pets per class and require them to be on a leash or a crate. We also need to remind the students to clean up after their pets.<p class=message>Those sound like reasonable rules. I think we could also include a provision for students who are allergic to animals or have phobias.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. We should also make sure that the pets are up-to-date on their vaccinations.<p class=message>Definitely. We wouldn't want any cases of animal-borne illnesses on campus. Is there anything else you want to discuss?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. I've been getting some complaints from students who smoke near the entrances of the buildings.<p class=message>Ah, yes. We have designated smoking areas on campus. I'll make sure to remind the students about this rule.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. I appreciate your help. You're such a helpful assistant!<p class=message>No problem, Professor. It's my pleasure to assist you. Is there anything else you need help with?<p class="message sent">Not at the moment. Thanks again, A!<p class=message>You're welcome, Professor. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d0ce8c49-9d50-4b7d-8729-a004ee66be7a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
