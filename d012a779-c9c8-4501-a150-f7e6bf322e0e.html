I hope everything is going well on the software development end.<p class="message sent">Hi A, everything is going fine. We just finished the latest software release, so things are relatively calm for a change.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I was just going over the results from the latest vulnerability scan, and I noticed a few issues that need to be addressed.<p class="message sent">Really? I thought we had resolved all the vulnerabilities in the last release. What did the scan uncover?<p class=message>There were a few SQL injection flaws and some issues with input validation. The good news is that they aren't too serious, but we need to patch them up quickly.<p class="message sent">Ah, that's not too bad at all. We'll get the patch out and tested within a few days.<p class=message>That's good to hear. While you're working on the patch, I'm going to grab a cup of coffee. Do you want anything?<p class="message sent">No, thanks. I think I'll stay put and hammer out the patch. Can't have any vulnerabilities lingering around, right?<p class=message>(laughing) That's right. We don't want any malicious intruders wreaking havoc on our beautiful code.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Absolutely not. Our code needs to be sturdy and secure, just like a fortified castle.<p class=message>(grinning) That's an interesting analogy, but I like the sound of it. We'll keep our code as secure as the keep of a castle.<p class="message sent">(smiling) You got it, A. Let's make sure those vulnerabilities don't stand a chance against our might.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d00e4ff7-332f-4a3d-bc31-97d10fd1208d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
