Can you please state your name for the record?<p class="message sent">Uh, sure. My name is John Smith.<p class=message>Thank you, Mr. Smith. Now, can you tell us why you were seen entering the property that was reported to have been burglarized?<p class="message sent">(Laughs nervously) Well, officer, I was actually looking for my dog. He ran away and I thought he might have gone into that house.<p class=message>(Raises an eyebrow) Really? And why didn't you just knock on the door and ask the residents if they had seen him?<p class="message sent">(Scratches his head) Well, I guess I didn't want to disturb them. Plus, my dog is pretty shy so he might have run off.<p class=message>I see. And what's your dog's name?<p class="message sent">(Smiling) His name is Max. He's a golden retriever.<p class=message>(Smiling back) Ah, I see. Those are great dogs. Have you found him yet?<p class="message sent">(Shaking his head) Not yet. But I'm still looking.<p class=message>Well, Mr. Smith, we'll be looking further into this case, but I hope you don't mind if we keep an eye out for Max as well.<p class="message sent">(Grinning) Of course not, officer. The more eyes looking for him, the better.<p class=message>(Chuckling) All right, Mr. Smith. You're free to go for now, but please let us know if you do find your dog.<p class="message sent">(Standing up) Thank you, officer. I will.<p class=message>(Smiling) Have a good day, sir.<p class="message sent">You too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=36e52752-cad4-49ed-9af3-a24a753bc138.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
