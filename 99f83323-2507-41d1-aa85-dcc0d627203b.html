My name is A and I'm a tea expert. I hear this tea bar is known for making some amazing tea cocktails.<p class="message sent">Yes, you've come to the right place. We're always trying out new combinations and flavors.<p class=message>That’s great! I’m currently experimenting with a new blend of Taiwanese oolong tea and jasmine flower.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting! So how would you like that to be incorporated into a cocktail?<p class=message>I was hoping to make a cocktail with a dark rum base and a hint of spiciness, maybe adding some cinnamon or chili.<p class="message sent">Interesting combination! We could call it the "Taiwanese Firefly".<p class=message>I love that name! How about adding some fruit flavors like passion fruit or mango to balance out the spiciness?<p class="message sent">Great idea! We could make it as a slushy or serve it over ice.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds delightful! What other cocktail specialties do you have here?<p class="message sent">We have a wide array of signature drinks, with everything from classic cocktails to drinks with unique ingredients like lavender and rose petals.<p class=message>That’s impressive! Could you recommend any tea cocktails that are particularly popular?<p class="message sent">The "Green Apple Mojito" is always a favorite among our guests. We use fresh mint, apple juice, light rum and green tea, served over crushed ice.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds refreshing! I’ll definitely have to try it.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, and we’re always happy to create customized drinks for our guests, so let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<p class=message>I appreciate that, thank you so much! It’s been a pleasure meeting you and I'm excited to try out some of your fantastic tea cocktails.<p class="message sent">Likewise, and we are always glad to have a tea expert like you around to help us with our amazing creations. Enjoy your drinks!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99f6470a-d0fc-4e40-b648-301d5078de4a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
