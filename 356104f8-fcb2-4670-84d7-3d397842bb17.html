Have you heard about ISO 27001 Encryption?<p class="message sent">Nope. I'm afraid I'm not that tech-savvy, A. What is it about?<p class=message>It's alright, B. Basically, it's a set of rules that organizations can use to protect their information from cyber attacks by encrypting data.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. Is it something we can apply for our organization?<p class=message>Absolutely! It's not only for big businesses. Even small companies can use it. Plus, it'll give us an extra layer of security.<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic! But... What does ISO stand for?<p class=message>It stands for International Organization for Standardization. It's the same organization that determines the standards for measuring the size of your shoes, your paper, and even your camera's film sensitivity!<p class="message sent">Whoa! They're like the gods of standardization, huh?<p class=message>Yes, and they're not exclusive to tech stuff! By the way, did you know that ISO 27001 entails more than just encrypting data?<p class="message sent">Really? What else does it have?<p class=message>It also requires us to have an established approach to risk management and continuous improvement. In other words, it's a never-ending process!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a lot of work. But, hey, better safe than sorry, right?<p class=message>Exactly! And once we've got the system running, we'll be able to sleep soundly, knowing that our important data is secure.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more, A. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=355bac8f-7a12-408c-8ebe-f34446425557.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
