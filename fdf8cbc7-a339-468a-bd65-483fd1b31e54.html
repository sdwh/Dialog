I need some legal advice but I'm not exactly sure what I need it for.<p class=message>Not a problem at all. Let's start with your situation. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on?<p class="message sent">Well, I recently bought a new car and I've been having a lot of problems with it. I'm not sure if I have any legal options to try and get it resolved.<p class=message>Okay, that's a good starting point. Have you tried speaking with the dealership or the manufacturer?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been back and forth with them for weeks now and I haven't gotten anywhere.<p class=message>Well, there are a few different paths we could explore. We could try to negotiate with the dealership, escalate the issue to the manufacturer, or potentially consider legal action.<p class="message sent">Legal action sounds intimidating. Is that something we could really do?<p class=message>It's definitely a possibility, but it's important to weigh the pros and cons of that option. It's also possible that just the threat of legal action could push the dealership or manufacturer to take your concerns more seriously.<p class="message sent">Okay, I think I understand. What would be the next steps?<p class=message>First, I would need to review any documentation you have related to the car purchase and your interactions with the dealership and manufacturer. Then, we could discuss your options and come up with a plan moving forward.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Thank you for your help.<p class=message>Of course, happy to assist. Let's set up another meeting to go over the documents and start mapping out a plan.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fdf8b464-5ea3-4328-a9de-93ed82c30df5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
