Can you tell me more about the local culture and landmarks here at the beach?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! We're known for our fresh seafood and traditional fisherman boats. You'll also notice many locals wearing the traditional Malong cloth.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. What are some popular local dishes I should try?<p class="message sent">You must try our Adobo dish, which is a slow-cooked meat dish in vinegar and soy sauce.

What about popular places to visit?<p class="message sent">You should definitely check out the Paoay Church, a UNESCO World Heritage site.
