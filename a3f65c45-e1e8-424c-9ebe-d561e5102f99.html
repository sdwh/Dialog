How’s it going with the code inspection?<p class="message sent">Hey A, it’s going okay. I’ve found some issues in the source code that need to be fixed.<p class=message>That’s great news! What kinds of issues did you find?<p class="message sent">Mostly small things like unused variables and functions. But there were a couple of more serious problems, like null pointer exceptions.<p class=message>Oh, those can be tricky. Did you manage to figure out what caused them?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. It turned out to be a silly mistake in one of the functions. I just had to add a null check to fix it.<p class=message>That’s good to hear. Did you find anything else?<p class="message sent">Actually, there was one thing that I couldn’t figure out. There were some weird formatting issues that were causing errors, but I couldn’t find the source of the problem.<p class=message>Hmm, that’s odd. Have you tried running the code through a linter?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did that. It helped a bit, but there were still some issues that it didn’t catch.<p class=message>Well, we could always try to refactor the code a bit. That might help with the formatting.<p class="message sent">That’s a good idea. I think I’ll give that a shot. Thanks, A!<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. Let me know if you need any more assistance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a3f0f25e-9a50-471d-95a5-abddec30ab3d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
