Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm the system engineer. Pleasure to meet you too.<p class=message>So, I understand we're here to discuss optimizing big data processing?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct. It's become quite the challenge for us in the medical research field.<p class=message>Definitely. With so much data to handle, it's crucial that we have an efficient system.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Have you considered upgrading our storage systems?<p class=message>Yes, we're looking into getting solid state drives. That should definitely speed things up.<p class="message sent">Great. Have you also thought about implementing parallel processing?<p class=message>Yes, we're working on that too. We're also exploring the possibility of using cloud computing for scalability.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. I've also heard about using machine learning to help with data analysis. Have you considered that?<p class=message>Actually, we have. We're currently in talks with a data science team to help us implement that.<p class="message sent">Sounds like we're on the right track. By the way, have you heard about the new algae-based data storage solution?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Tell me more.<p class="message sent">Apparently, it's a more environmentally-friendly solution that's also more secure. We should definitely look into it.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. I'll add that to our list of potential options.<p class="message sent">Great. It's always good to explore new possibilities. By the way, do you want to grab lunch after this meeting?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds good. There's a great sandwich place down the street we can check out.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. Let's do it. Thanks for the chat, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Thank you too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=32079860-a325-4a4c-bb1f-305a2d99aaab.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
