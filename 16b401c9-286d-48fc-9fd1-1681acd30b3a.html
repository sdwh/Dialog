Thanks for meeting me today. Can I get you anything to drink?<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm good, thanks. Just had my coffee fix for the day.<p class=message>Nice choice. So, what do you do? Can you tell me a bit about your job?<p class="message sent">Sure! I'm a pastry chef. I make all kinds of desserts and pastries.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! Do you have a favorite dessert to bake?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough one. I love making Ã©clairs and macarons.<p class=message>Yum! I'm getting hungry just hearing about them. How did you become a pastry chef?<p class="message sent">I actually started cooking at a young age with my grandma. She taught me how to bake and it just kind of stuck with me.<p class=message>That's so sweet. Do you ever get tired of baking?<p class="message sent">Not really. I mean, I do get tired sometimes, but then I just try out new recipes and get re-energized.<p class=message>That's a great attitude. Do you have any tips for amateur bakers like myself?<p class="message sent">Always measure your ingredients carefully, and don't be afraid to experiment with new flavors and techniques.<p class=message>Good advice. So, do you have any big projects or events coming up?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm in the process of opening my own bakery!<p class=message>Wow! Congratulations, that's amazing news.<p class="message sent">Thank you! I'm really excited about it.<p class=message>I bet. Well, thank you so much for chatting with me today. It was really nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">No problem, it was great to meet you too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=16b3a5eb-c321-43b7-a354-700687aa5faa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
