I'm excited to be working with you today on cooking up some delicious seafood dishes.<p class="message sent">Good morning A, it's great to have you here! I've heard great things about your fresh catches, what have you brought in today?<p class=message>We've got some fantastic lobsters and crabs, as well as some succulent oysters and prawns that I just caught this morning.<p class="message sent">Wow, those sound amazing! Let's start with the oysters, shall we? How do you usually prepare them?<p class=message>I usually keep it simple, just shucking them and serving them on ice with some lemon wedges and a mignonette sauce.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect, let's do that. And for the lobsters and crabs, how do you suggest we cook them?<p class=message>I like to steam the lobsters and roast the crabs with some herbs and spices for a bit of extra flavor.<p class="message sent">Wonderful, I can already smell the aroma! Let's get started and create some mouth-watering dishes for our customers.<p class=message>Absolutely, I'm ready to get cracking. It's always great being able to work with someone who shares the same passion for seafood as I do.<p class="message sent">Same here A, it's been great collaborating with you. I'm sure our customers are going to love the dishes we create today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f20acb5e-e46b-4bae-acfb-b239e0a34ac3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
