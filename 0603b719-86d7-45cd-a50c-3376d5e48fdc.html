Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Pleasure to meet you too! I'm the manager of this restaurant. Thanks for coming to lend a hand.<p class=message>No problem at all. Wow, your dessert plate looks amazing! They really pop out on this white dish.<p class="message sent">Thank you! We wanted to create something that's both visually pleasing and delicious.<p class=message>I'd say you nailed it. Can I ask how you made that chocolate decoration?<p class="message sent">Oh sure, it's actually a super easy trick. We melted the chocolate and poured it on a flat surface to harden, then used a cookie cutter to shape it.<p class=message>That's genius! By the way, did you draw inspiration from anywhere for the decor?<p class="message sent">We did! We wanted something that reflected the area, so we incorporated elements of local culture like calligraphy and bamboo.<p class=message>That's a really nice touch. Have you had any feedback from customers yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, the customers really love the presentation. We even had a few people asking for pictures.<p class=message>Well, I can see why. I think it looks great. By the way, can I try the red bean and matcha cake?<p class="message sent">Of course! Here you go. Let me know what you think.<p class=message>Mmm, it's really good! The matcha flavor isn't too overpowering and it complements the red bean nicely.<p class="message sent">I'm so glad you like it. Our pastry chef worked really hard on it.<p class=message>It definitely shows. You guys are doing a great job here.<p class="message sent">Thank you! We really appreciate your help and feedback.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=06030355-ba97-45f0-aed9-b1b801ffb0a3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
