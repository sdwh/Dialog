Nice to meet you, B, the network engineer.<p class="message sent">Hi A, nice to meet you too. So, what are we discussing today?<p class=message>Our company's network security, actually. I've noticed some vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.<p class="message sent">Hmmm, that's interesting. What are some of the areas that you think we should focus on?<p class=message>Well, for one, we should definitely tighten up our authentication protocols. Passwords should be stronger and more complex.<p class="message sent">I totally agree with you. We should also make sure that all our software and antivirus programs are up-to-date.<p class=message>Yes, and we should limit access to sensitive information to only those who need it. We can use firewalls to help with that.<p class="message sent">I get it. But we also have to think about making all these changes and keeping it user-friendly too.<p class=message>Great point. We don't want to make it too complicated for our employees to access the network.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we can provide training sessions for employees to learn how to keep their information secure too. Education is key.<p class=message>Absolutely. And let's not forget about physical security as well. We need to make sure the servers are in a secured room.<p class="message sent">Right. And we can use security cameras to monitor any suspicious activity outside the server room.<p class=message>Exactly. It's all about being proactive and making sure we're doing everything we can to protect our company and its data.<p class="message sent">Well, it seems like we have our work cut out for us, but I'm excited to get started on this project!<p class=message>Me too. I'm glad we can work together on this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c9f55c1c-a950-46d1-afc6-374284e89a60.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
