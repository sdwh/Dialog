It sounds exciting!<p class="message sent">Yes, I agree. With the amount of data we have, we can build some really powerful models. But we need to make sure we have enough labeled data to train them properly.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we also need to think about the features we'll use - things like call duration, plan type, and location could all be relevant.<p class="message sent">Right. And itâ€™s important to remember that we can't rely solely on historical usage data. We need to consider external factors like competition and customer satisfaction ratings.<p class=message>That's a good point. We should also explore different types of models, such as logistic regression and decision trees, to see which one performs the best.<p class="message sent">And it would be great if we could use the insights we gain from this project to improve our customer service and retention efforts.<p class=message>Yes, definitely. We want to use the predictions to prevent churn rather than just react to it after the fact.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And in the end, our ultimate goal is to provide our customers with the best possible experience and retain them for the long term.<p class=message>Right. We don't want our customers to say "goodbye" when they could be saying "hello" to better service.<p class="message sent">Haha, very true! Let's get started on this project and start predicting who's going to stick around and who's going to say "hello" to our competitors.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f3fa6a5d-eca1-4144-8d5c-a9308356a8b1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
