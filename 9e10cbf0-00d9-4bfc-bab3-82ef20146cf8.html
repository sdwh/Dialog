Nice to meet you, B, an AI engineer.<p class="message sent">Hi A, nice to meet you too. So, we're here to discuss developing a self-driving system, right?<p class=message>Yes, that's right. It's an exciting project, but also very challenging. What do you think are the biggest obstacles we need to overcome?<p class="message sent">There are many hurdles, but I would say the most crucial one is ensuring the system's reliability and safety. We don't want the car to crash or malfunction while on the road.<p class=message>Agreed. We also need to ensure that the system can work effectively in a variety of scenarios, from dense city traffic to open highways.<p class="message sent">That's right. The system needs to be adaptable and responsive to all sorts of environmental factors, such as weather and road conditions.<p class=message>So, what kind of AI technology do you think would be most useful for the self-driving system?<p class="message sent">Well, we need to use machine learning algorithms to enable the system to recognize and respond to different situations. What do you think?<p class=message>I think you're right. We also need to use deep learning to help the system learn from its mistakes and improve over time.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Another important consideration is establishing effective communication between the car and the passengers inside.<p class=message>Yes, we need to make sure the system can provide information and feedback to the passengers in real-time.<p class="message sent">And we also need to make sure that the passengers can communicate with the system and override its decisions if necessary.<p class=message>Right. It's a complex system, but I'm confident we can develop something amazing together.<p class="message sent">Same here. I can't wait to see what we can accomplish.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e0f3494-dc83-4665-bc79-1c5e872da7d2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
