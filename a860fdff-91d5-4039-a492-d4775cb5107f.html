It's all about information security management, right?<p class=message>Exactly! Have you ever implemented it in your company?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but we're considering it. Have you?<p class=message>Yeah, we implemented it last year. It has really helped us improve our information security measures.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. How was the implementation process?<p class=message>It wasn't too bad, but it did require a lot of planning and coordination between different departments.<p class="message sent">What were some of the challenges you faced during the implementation?<p class=message>One of the biggest challenges was getting everyone on board with the changes to policies and procedures. It took some time to get everyone trained and used to the new way of doing things.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I can imagine that would be tough. Did you use any specific tools or software to help with the implementation?<p class=message>We did use some software to help with risk assessments and documentation. It really saved us a lot of time and made the process much smoother.<p class="message sent">That's a great tip, thanks for sharing. How has ISO 27001 Management benefitted your company so far?<p class=message>We've seen a significant reduction in security breaches and incidents. It has also improved our reputation with clients who are concerned about information security.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic. It sounds like it's definitely worth considering for our company as well.<p class=message>Definitely. If you have any questions or need any advice, don't hesitate to ask me.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate it. It's always helpful to get insight from someone with first-hand experience.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a85f6ffd-96dc-4ee9-8408-794f06f9960a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
