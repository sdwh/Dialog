I'm the bread maker, what kind of bread would you like today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I'm the coffee maker, hmm... I'll have to try them all to decide.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, we have your classic sourdough, multigrain, and cinnamon raisin.<p class="message sent">How about one cinnamon raisin and one multigrain please?<p class=message>Great choice! Would you like me to slice them for you?<p class="message sent">No, thanks. I'll bring them whole to my customers, it's more fun that way.<p class=message>I totally agree! So, what kind of coffee would you like to pair with your bread?<p class="message sent">Maybe a latte and a cappuccino? And can you spice up my latte with some cinnamon?<p class=message>Sure, coming right up! By the way, I love your apron, it's very colorful.<p class="message sent">Thank you! A friend of mine gave it to me, she's a fashion designer.<p class=message>Really? That's so cool. I always admire people who can create beautiful things like that.<p class="message sent">Oh, I bet you can create something beautiful too! I mean, making bread is an art, isn't it?<p class=message>Definitely! You have to have a good eye and feel for the dough, just like an artist with their paint.<p class="message sent">Exactly! And speaking of artists, have you checked out the new mural across the street? It's amazing.<p class=message>No, I haven't seen it yet. What's it like?<p class="message sent">It's a huge butterfly made of colorful petals, it's so uplifting.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds incredible. I'll have to check it out after work.<p class="message sent">You should! It's definitely worth a visit. And speaking of work, we should get back to it.<p class=message>Agreed! Thanks for the lovely chat, enjoy your coffee and bread.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I will! Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=440469be-0c6d-42a1-bc28-e60b4de8d194.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
