I'm a fisherman and I'm here to explore the Tsukiji fish market. Could you show me around?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'd be happy to! Tsukiji is the largest fish market in the world. Let's go check out the different vendors and see what's fresh today.<p class=message>That sounds great! What do you recommend I look for when selecting fish?<p class="message sent">Choosing the right fish is simple. You want to look for bright, clear eyes, and shiny skin. A fish that feels firm to the touch is also a good sign.<p class=message>I see. How can I tell if a fish is too old?<p class="message sent">One way to tell if a fish is too old is by the smell. If it smells sour or has a strong fishy odor, it's best to avoid it.<p class=message>That's good to know. I notice there are so many different types of fish here. Which is your favorite?<p class="message sent">There are so many to choose from, but I love the seasonal sardines. They're so fresh and flavorsome.<p class=message>They sound delicious. What should I look for when purchasing sardines?<p class="message sent">Look for sardines with bright silver skin and plump bodies. The eyes should also be clear and bulging, and the gills should be bright red.<p class=message>Thanks for the tips! What other seafoods would you recommend trying here?<p class="message sent">If you're feeling adventurous, you should try the sea urchin. It's a delicacy here and has a sweet, buttery flavor.<p class=message>I've never tried it before, but I might just give it a go! By the way, how long has Tsukiji fish market been around?<p class="message sent">It's been around for over 80 years, and it's been the heart of Tokyo's seafood industry for centuries.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive! Thanks for showing me around, I'm excited to try out all these fresh delicacies.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! I hope you enjoy your time here and have some amazing meals. Don't forget to come back again next time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=50b01641-9688-4ed5-a5c6-64e383e665f3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
