Great idea, let me know what you need so we can make sure everything is in order.<p class=message>I saw on the website that the rooms have hairdryers, but I don't see one in my room.<p class="message sent">Ah, don't worry. The hairdryers are usually stored in the bathroom cabinet. Have you checked there?<p class=message>Oh, I didn't think to look there. Thanks for the tip. By the way, have you tried the hotel breakfast?<p class="message sent">Yes, and it's amazing! The pastries are so fresh and the coffee is top-notch.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm definitely going to have to try it out.<p class="message sent">And don't forget about the rooftop pool! It's the perfect spot to unwind and take in some scenic views.<p class=message>Oh, I almost forgot about the pool. I'll have to make time to check it out.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, you won't regret it. Did you bring your workout gear?<p class=message>Yeah, I did. Why do you ask?<p class="message sent">Well, the hotel gym is pretty impressive. We could get in a quick workout before breakfast if you're up for it.<p class=message>Sounds like a good idea. Let's do it!<p class="message sent">Perfect, let's meet in the gym in 30 minutes.<p class=message>Deal! Thanks for the suggestion.<p class="message sent">No problem! I'm always happy to help out a fellow traveler.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c243f987-a316-4411-84da-23a85bf2876d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
