How's your day going, sir?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, just another day on the job. Heading to New York, eh?<p class=message>Yes, I have some business meetings to attend. Have you been driving for a long time?<p class="message sent">Oh, about 15 years now. I've seen a lot of crazy things on these streets, let me tell you.<p class=message>I bet! What's the craziest thing you've ever witnessed while driving?<p class="message sent">Well, once I saw a guy driving a unicycle through traffic with a parrot on his shoulder. I couldn't believe my eyes!<p class=message>Wow, that's definitely a unique sight! Have you always lived in this area?<p class="message sent">Yeah, born and raised right here in the city. It can be hectic at times but it's home.<p class=message>That's cool. Do you have any favorite spots in New York that you like to recommend to tourists?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely check out Central Park, Times Square, and the Statue of Liberty. Those are classic must-see spots.<p class=message>I certainly will, thank you. How much longer until we get to my destination?<p class="message sent">Just a few more minutes, we're making good time. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the city?<p class=message>No, I think that's all for now. I appreciate your knowledge and friendly attitude.<p class="message sent">Thank you, sir. It's always a pleasure to meet new people and share some stories. Have a successful day at your meetings!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b3250b8-538f-45b9-b09b-696b670f18d6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
