How's the restaurant business treating you?<p class="message sent">Good, good. But we've been thinking of expanding our drinks menu beyond wine and cocktails. That's where you come in!<p class=message>Sounds interesting. What did you have in mind?<p class="message sent">We were thinking of partnering with a local microbrewery. But then we thought, why not start our own?<p class=message>Ah, I see where you're going with this. And I assume you want me to be your brewmaster?<p class="message sent">That's right! You know your beer and we know our food. It's a perfect match.<p class=message>Well, I'm flattered. But what would the theme of our microbrewery be?<p class="message sent">We're thinking of giving it that old-world charm. Think a 1920s speakeasy vibe. What do you think?<p class=message>That sounds awesome! And it'll open up new possibilities in terms of food pairings.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And we're also thinking of hosting beer tasting events and beer and food pairings.<p class=message>Great idea. I can't wait to get started.<p class="message sent">Neither can we. We're excited about the prospect of offering Tacoma something new and exciting.<p class=message>And who knows, maybe one day we'll turn this into a full-blown brewery.<p class="message sent">One step at a time! But I have a feeling this venture will be a success.<p class=message>Ditto. Cheers to our new partnership!<p class="message sent">Cheers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f34683c-34dc-4359-a9d1-f70837b0a82a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
