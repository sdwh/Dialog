How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you, A?<p class=message>I'm great, thanks. So, tell me about what you do for a living.<p class="message sent">Well, I'm a professional clown. I perform at children's birthday parties and carnivals.<p class=message>That's interesting! What made you want to be a clown?<p class="message sent">I've always loved making people laugh and bringing joy to others. As a clown, I can do that every day.<p class=message>That's really cool. Do you have any funny stories from your performances?<p class="message sent">Oh, plenty! One time, I accidentally squirted myself in the face with my water flower during a show. The kids thought it was hilarious!<p class=message>Haha! That's definitely a blooper moment. What's the most challenging part of being a clown?<p class="message sent">I'd say it's dealing with children who are afraid of clowns. It can be tough to coax them out of their shell and get them to feel comfortable around me.<p class=message>I can imagine. Do you have any tips for someone who wants to become a clown?<p class="message sent">Yes, don't be afraid to be silly and let loose! And remember to always prioritize safety and respect for the audience.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice, B. Well, that's all the time we have for today. Thanks for chatting with me!<p class="message sent">No problem, it was my pleasure. Thanks for having me!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9b102ee9-6aa2-4e88-81fc-0ab81ef45cf6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
