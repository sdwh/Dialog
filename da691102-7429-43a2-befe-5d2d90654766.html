How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too! I'm excited to get to work and start baking some delicious bread.<p class="message sent">Me too! What's on the menu for today?<p class=message>We're making baguettes, croissants, and some cinnamon rolls.<p class="message sent">Yum, I love cinnamon rolls! Do you need any help with the bread?<p class=message>Actually, that would be great. Can you start mixing the dough while I prep the ovens?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. So, A, how long have you been a chef?<p class=message>I've been a chef for about 10 years now. How about you, B? When did you start baking?<p class="message sent">I started baking when I was a kid with my grandma. But professionally, I've been a baker for about 5 years.<p class=message>That's really cool. I learned how to make bread from my mom. She used to bake bread for our family every week.<p class="message sent">That's a great skill to have. Do you have a favorite bread or pastry to bake?<p class=message>Hmm, that's a tough question. I love making sourdough bread, but I also really enjoy making chocolate croissants.<p class="message sent">I love a good croissant too. And your chocolate croissants are delicious!<p class=message>Thanks, B! I'm happy to hear that. Hey, do you want to try one of the cinnamon rolls we just made?<p class="message sent">Of course! Let me grab one. Mmm, it's so good. You have a real talent for baking, A.<p class=message>Thank you, B. I appreciate that. It's always nice when our hard work pays off and people enjoy our creations.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's one of the things I love about working here. We get to make people happy with our delicious bread.<p class=message>That's definitely one of the perks of being a chef and baker. Well, I think we better get back to work. Lots of dough to shape and bake!<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's make some more yummy bread and pastries for our customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=da67a37f-0d23-4f0f-86cf-94b6e6ebc1b3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
