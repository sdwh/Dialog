How's business at our caf√© today?<p class="message sent">Very busy, A. The locals seem to love our breakfast menu.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I think our homemade granola and yogurt is a crowd favorite.<p class="message sent">Yes, I agree. And how about our coffee menu?<p class=message>Our espresso drinks are always a hit. But I think we should try some new syrups to add some more variety.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea, A. Maybe we can try a lavender syrup or even a pumpkin spice syrup for the fall season.<p class=message>I think our customers would definitely love that. By the way, have you tried our new smoothie bowl?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard great things about it. What's in it?<p class=message>It's a mix of berries, banana, Greek yogurt, and topped with granola and honey. It's delicious.<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing. I'll have to try it for lunch. Speaking of lunch, have you thought about adding some new sandwiches to our menu?<p class=message>Yes, I was actually thinking about a grilled chicken pesto sandwich or a veggie hummus wrap.<p class="message sent">Those both sound delicious. Let's add those to the menu and see how they do. Thanks for your great ideas, A.<p class=message>Of course, B. I love brainstorming new menu items with you. Together we make a great team.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And thanks for always providing excellent service to our customers, A. You truly are a helpful assistant.<p class=message>Thank you, B. It's my pleasure to work with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=74a851df-0d47-43e6-95cf-e92d43d68bfb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
