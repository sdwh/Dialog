How was your drive out here to the countryside today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It was long, but beautiful. These winding country roads can be a bit tricky though.<p class=message>Yes, they can be. But let's get down to business. We have a lot of livestock that need to be transported to the market.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I have my truck all cleaned and ready to go. How many animals are we transporting today?<p class=message>About forty cows and twenty sheep. They're all healthy and ready for sale.<p class="message sent">Excellent. I'll make sure they have plenty of water and food on the way. Speaking of sales, what's the price range we're looking at?<p class=message>Well, prices have been fluctuating lately, but I think we can expect to sell the cows for about $2,000 each and the sheep for $500 each.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's great news! I'm sure we'll have no trouble finding buyers at those prices.<p class=message>Right, and don't forget to keep an eye out for any potential buyers on the way to the market. You never know who may be interested in buying our livestock.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely keep that in mind. By the way, have you tried the local cheese made from the milk of these cows? It's delicious!<p class=message>No, I haven't yet. Maybe we'll have to treat ourselves to some cheese after all the hard work is done.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Let's get these animals loaded up and on their way.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8bba1b6e-40a9-4f92-a4aa-1e28e6f3f00a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
