How's it going?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, A! How about you?<p class=message>I'm having a lot of fun playing this new game on the XBOX Series X! Have you tried it yet?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. What's it called?<p class=message>It's called "Superhero Showdown" and it's really addicting! You should definitely give it a try.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll have to check it out. What's your favorite character to play as?<p class=message>I really like playing as Captain Courageous. He's got some great moves and he looks awesome in his costume!<p class="message sent">Sounds cool. I usually like to play the villains, myself. They're just so much more interesting.<p class=message>Haha, I can see why you'd say that. The villains in this game are pretty fun to play as too. Do you have a favorite?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I really like playing as Dr. Destruction. He's got some serious firepower!<p class=message>Nice! Maybe we should team up and take on the world together sometime.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a plan. I'm always up for some superhero action.<p class=message>Awesome! I'll send you an invite next time I'm playing.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. See you then!<p class=message>See ya! And don't forget to brush up on your superhero skills before we play, B!<p class="message sent">Haha, don't worry, A.
