May I know if you have any preferences for your meal today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Actually, I'd love to try some traditional Japanese cuisine. Maybe you could recommend some dishes?<p class=message>Sure, we have a variety of options such as tempura, sushi, and sukiyaki. Perhaps you can try our kaiseki course, which includes a variety of small dishes.<p class="message sent">That sounds great! I also heard that you have a tea ceremony experience. Could you tell me more about it?<p class=message>Yes, we have a tea ceremony experience led by our tea master. It's a traditional practice that showcases the Japanese culture of hospitality and respect for nature.<p class="message sent">Fascinating! I would love to try it out after my meal. How much does it cost?<p class=message>It costs 2,000 yen per person and includes a selection of fine Japanese sweets and tea.<p class="message sent">Wonderful! I'll definitely join the ceremony. By the way, have you tried making any of the dishes on the menu?<p class=message>Yes, as the manager, I have to ensure that our dishes meet the standards and quality of traditional Japanese cuisine. My personal favorite is the tempura.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love tempura too! Maybe I'll have that as one of my dishes. Is there any special technique to eating it?<p class=message>Well, traditionally, it's best to dip it lightly in the soy sauce and then place it in your mouth so that the batter stays crispy.<p class="message sent">I'll remember that. Thank you for the tip! Now, what type of tea do you recommend for the tea ceremony?<p class=message>Our tea master usually serves matcha tea, which is a finely ground powdered green tea. It's known for its health benefits and unique flavor.<p class="message sent">I'm excited to try it! This whole experience of traditional Japanese cuisine and tea ceremonies is so inspiring. Thank you for sharing your expertise with me!<p class=message>It's our pleasure to provide a truly authentic experience for our customers. We hope you enjoy your meal and tea ceremony.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=930a94c3-2b80-4916-aa51-ab4cbcf6fdfe.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
