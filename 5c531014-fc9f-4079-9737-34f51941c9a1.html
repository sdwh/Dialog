Thanks for meeting with me today. I'm really excited to talk to you about my new book.<p class="message sent">Of course, I'm always happy to meet with published authors. So tell me about this new book of yours.<p class=message>Well, it's a humor novel about a group of misfits who start their own detective agency. I wanted to write something lighthearted and fun.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. What's the title?<p class=message>"The Case of the Missing Catnip." It's a play on the classic detective stories.<p class="message sent">I like it! What sets this book apart from others in the genre?<p class=message>I think the characters are really unique and memorable. And of course, the humor is a big draw. I also included some Easter eggs for fans of the detective genre.<p class="message sent">Sounds like you put a lot of thought into this. Have you thought about marketing?<p class=message>Absolutely. I'm planning on doing some events at local bookstores and reaching out to book bloggers. Plus, I think the cover is really eye-catching.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Do you have any other book ideas in mind?<p class=message>I'm working on something completely different actually. It's a historical fiction set in medieval times.<p class="message sent">Wow, you really like to mix it up, don't you?<p class=message>Keeps things interesting! But for now, I'm just excited to see "The Case of the Missing Catnip" hit shelves.<p class="message sent">Well, I'll be sure to spread the word. Best of luck with the book, A.<p class=message>Thanks so much, B. I really appreciate your support. It means a lot.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5c527119-1079-4dd9-8d4b-ff738690ff4a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
