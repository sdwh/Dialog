The grill is ready to go. Start cooking those delicious meats!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, A. By the way, I heard you went on vacation. How was it?<p class=message>It was great! I went to Japan and ate so much sushi. I’m still dreaming about it.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Any recommendations?<p class=message>Definitely try the fatty tuna. It melts in your mouth like butter. And don’t forget the uni!<p class="message sent">I’ll keep that in mind. So, what’s on the menu today?<p class=message>We have some marinated beef and pork belly. And we also have some fresh vegetables for grilling.<p class="message sent">Perfect. I’ll get to work on the meats while you prep the veggies.<p class=message>Do you need any help?<p class="message sent">No, I think I got this. But could you pass me that seasoning over there?<p class=message>Sure thing. Here you go. So, how’s the restaurant doing these days?<p class="message sent">We’ve been pretty busy, especially on weekends. I think people are really starting to crave Korean BBQ.<p class=message>That’s great to hear. I’m glad we’re getting more recognition.<p class="message sent">Me too. And the best part about cooking is getting to taste-test everything!<p class=message>Haha, true. But don’t eat too much or you’ll spoil your appetite.<p class="message sent">I’ll try to restrain myself. But it’s hard when everything smells so delicious!<p class=message>Just make sure to save room for dinner. We have a lot of hungry customers waiting.<p class="message sent">Don’t worry, boss. I got this under control. Let’s make some mouth-watering dishes!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6c6efa93-67c4-414f-bc2b-94e749b36334.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
