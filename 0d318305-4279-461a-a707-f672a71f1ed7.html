How's everything going?<p class="message sent message-content">Hey A! I'm good, how about you?<p class="message received message-content">I'm doing well. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about our publishing plans for a new book.<p class="message sent message-content">Sure thing, what do you have in mind?<p class="message received message-content">Well, I've been working on this novel for a while now, and I think it's finally ready to be published.<p class="message sent message-content">That's exciting! Can you tell me a bit more about it?<p class="message received message-content">It's a mystery novel set in a small town. The protagonist is a detective who is trying to solve a murder case.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds interesting. Do you have a title in mind?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, I was thinking of calling it "Murder in the Mayberry."<p class="message sent message-content">I like it! What about the cover design?<p class="message received message-content">I've been working with a graphic designer, and we have a few options. One has a magnifying glass and the other has a silhouette of a person.<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, tough choice. I think we should get some input from our marketing team.<p class="message received message-content">Agreed. Another question, what about the release date?<p class="message sent message-content">We need to consider the competition and make sure we have ample time for the marketing campaign. How about we aim for a fall release?<p class="message received message-content">Works for me. And on that note, I better get back to writing some more.<p class="message sent message-content">Looking forward to reading the rest of the novel, A. Keep up the good work!<p class="message received message-content">Thanks, B. And thanks for your help with the publishing plans. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0d214968-8a10-4552-b837-6ccbdb0070f9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
