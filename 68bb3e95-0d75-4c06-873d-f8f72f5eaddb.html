What do you need to know specifically?<p class=message>Well, I'm trying to get from Causeway Bay to Tsim Sha Tsui. What's the best route?<p class="message sent">That's easy! You can take the Island line from Causeway Bay to Admiralty, and then transfer to the Tsuen Wan line to get to Tsim Sha Tsui.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds simple enough. How often do the trains run?<p class="message sent">During peak hours, they run every 2-3 minutes, and during off-peak hours, they run every 4-6 minutes.<p class=message>That's impressive! How much is a single ride ticket?<p class="message sent">It depends on the distance traveled, but generally it ranges between HKD 5-40.<p class=message>Great, I think I'll get an Octopus card so I can use it for multiple rides.<p class="message sent">Good choice! The Octopus card can be used not only for the MTR, but also for buses, ferries, and even some retail shops.<p class=message>That's really convenient. What about if I want to go to the airport?<p class="message sent">The Airport Express is the fastest and most efficient way to get there. You can take it from Hong Kong or Kowloon stations directly to the airport in just 24 minutes.<p class=message>Wow, that's quick! And how often do those trains run?<p class="message sent">They run every 10 minutes during peak hours and every 12 minutes during off-peak hours.<p class=message>Thanks so much for your help, you've been really informative.<p class="message sent">No problem at all! Don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions. Enjoy your travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=68b24d30-983b-462f-8f90-77835cc872aa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
