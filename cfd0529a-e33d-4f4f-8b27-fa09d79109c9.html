It's going pretty well, just finishing up these grilled sea bass fillets.<p class=message>That's great. Did you get any special orders from customers today?<p class="message sent">Yeah, someone asked for a spicy miso glazed salmon fillet. I'm gonna fire that up in a sec.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! Speaking of flavors, have you tried the ginger soy marinade on the beef slices yet?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I marinated some beef ribs with it and it was so flavorful. I might have to try that with the fish next time.<p class=message>That's a great idea. You know what, I wanna try something new too. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Well, if you're feeling adventurous, the grilled squid with yuzu and wasabi glaze is pretty tasty.<p class=message>Hmm, I'm not sure if I've tried that before. Challenge accepted! And how about you? Anything you wanna try on this menu?<p class="message sent">I'm eyeing the beef tongue. I heard it's really tender and flavorful when grilled.<p class=message>Yes, it's one of our best-sellers. You won't be disappointed.<p class="message sent">Awesome, can't wait! Do you need any help on your end?<p class=message>No, I'm good for now. But let me know if you need an extra hand with anything.<p class="message sent">Will do, thanks!<p class=message>Speaking of hands, how's your grip? Don't wanna drop anything on the grill, haha.<p class="message sent">Haha, my grip is solid. But man, sometimes the oil splatters can be brutal.<p class=message>Yeah, gotta be careful. Safety first, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And customer satisfaction second. That's why we're in this business, after all.<p class=message>Right on. Let's keep grilling and pleasing those taste buds, my friend.<p class="message sent">You got it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cfc473b5-4916-442b-8922-96b0496e62d0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
