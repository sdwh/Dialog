How's it going for you tonight?<p class="message sent">Not bad, A. It's been a busy night serving up all these drinks.<p class=message>Speaking of which, what's been the most popular drink tonight?<p class="message sent">Definitely the Old Fashioned. It seems like everyone's in the mood for a classic cocktail tonight.<p class=message>Nice. Hearing that just makes me want to get in on the action, haha.<p class="message sent">You should! I'll make you one myself. But first, how's the kitchen doing?<p class=message>We're cooking away, as always. We had a pretty special request tonight for a vegan alternative to the steak dish, but we made it work.<p class="message sent">That sounds tricky. How'd you handle it?<p class=message>We actually used some vegan meat alternatives and spices to make it taste as close to the real thing as possible. The customer loved it.<p class="message sent">Well done, A! You really know how to please your customers.<p class=message>And you know how to make the perfect drink. This Old Fashioned is spot on.<p class="message sent">Glad you enjoy it. You know, sometimes I feel like being a bartender is like being a chef in its own way.<p class=message>That's so true. Making a great drink takes just as much care and attention to detail as cooking up a great meal.<p class="message sent">And we both get to see our customers' faces light up when we give them something they really love.<p class=message>Absolutely. Hey, do you want to sneak in a drink and meal for ourselves before we get back to work?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan to me. Cheers, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=97a6b82e-a3e1-4e4b-973c-5fd554a0607e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
