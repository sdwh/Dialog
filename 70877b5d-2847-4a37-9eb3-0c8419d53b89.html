How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm interested in visiting the Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. Can you help me with the travel arrangements?<p class=message>Of course! We offer a variety of tours that include visits to the Capitol Hill. There's the standard tour, which lasts about an hour, and the extended tour which is about twice as long. Which one are you interested in?<p class="message sent">I think I'll go for the extended tour. I want to see as much as I can.<p class=message>Great! We have a tour departing at 9 AM tomorrow. It includes a visit to the House and Senate galleries, as well as a guided tour of the Capitol building. Would you like to reserve a spot?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! And since I'm here for a few days, do you have any other recommendations for sightseeing?<p class=message>Absolutely! The National Mall is a must-see, with its many museums, monuments and memorials. The Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, and the Smithsonian museums are some of the top destinations.<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic! How do I get there?<p class=message>You can take the Metro, which has a station near the Capitol. It's a short ride to the National Mall, and there are plenty of buses and taxis as well.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your help. I'm excited to explore the city!<p class=message>You're welcome. If you have any more questions or need any assistance, don't hesitate to contact us. Enjoy your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7086d43e-0fa5-4671-a278-e8683be14682.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
