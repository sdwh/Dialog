It's always exciting to be driving through the city.<p class=message>Speaking of Osaka, have you tried Okonomiyaki before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's a delicious savory pancake that they make here. Have you tried it before?<p class=message>No, not yet but I'm really excited to try it. I also heard about the famous Kobe beef here.<p class="message sent">Yes, Kobe beef is famous for its delicious aroma and tender texture. I would highly recommend trying it at a restaurant here.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! By the way, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving taxis for about 10 years now. It's a fun and interesting job that lets me meet a lot of different people.<p class=message>That's really cool. What do you like most about driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">I enjoy the freedom and flexibility that comes with the job. I get to choose my own hours and routes, which is great.<p class=message>That does sound nice. Hey, do you have any favorite music artists that you like to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">I really enjoy listening to classic rock music. Bands like Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones are some of my favorites.<p class=message>Oh, I love those bands too! What's your favorite song by them?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough one. I would probably have to say "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin. It's a classic.<p class=message>I agree, that's a great song. Well, we're almost there. Thanks for the great conversation and safe driving.<p class="message sent">No problem at all! Have a great time in Osaka and enjoy the local cuisine!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2fb07e7c-a42f-432c-8fba-7ef0b8b93c94.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
