I hear you're a game developer. That's so cool!<p class="message sent">Yeah, I love creating games. I'm actually working on a new mobile game right now.<p class=message>Awesome! Can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Sure, it's a puzzle game where players have to match elements to progress through the levels.<p class=message>Sounds interesting! What kind of elements?<p class="message sent">There are different colors and shapes that need to be matched. And we're adding power-ups and special items too.<p class=message>Sweet! How's development going?<p class="message sent">It's going well, but we're still tweaking some of the mechanics. We want it to be challenging but not too difficult.<p class=message>I can imagine that's a delicate balance. Are you testing it with players?<p class="message sent">Yes, we're doing a closed beta right now. It's been helpful to get feedback and make adjustments.<p class=message>That's great. How long do you think until it's ready for release?<p class="message sent">We're aiming for a few months from now. There's still some work to be done, but we're making good progress.<p class=message>I bet it's exciting to see your idea come to life.<p class="message sent">Definitely! It's a lot of hard work, but it's worth it when you see people enjoying your game.<p class=message>Well, I can't wait to play it when it comes out. Keep up the good work!<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate it. And let me know if you have any ideas for future games!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a2004ebc-bd70-4e81-ab64-a96c3b75224b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
