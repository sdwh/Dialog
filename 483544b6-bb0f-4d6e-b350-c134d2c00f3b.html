This must be a popular bookstore in Tokyo.<p class="message sent">Yes, this is one of my favorite places to visit.

It's such a fascinating field to explore. Have you ever considered writing a book set in Japan?<p class=message>Actually, I have. I'm thinking of writing a mystery novel set in Tokyo.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! I can definitely help you with any translation or cultural research you might need.<p class=message>Thank you, that would be incredibly helpful. I've been taking notes on the different architecture and street food here, they could be great details for my book.<p class="message sent">Definitely. One thing I love about Japanese literature is how the setting is almost a character in itself. It's such an integral part of the story.<p class=message>Yes, that's exactly what I'm going for in my book. Have you read any Japanese mystery novels that you would recommend?<p class="message sent">Oh, there are so many great ones! One of my favorites is "Naoko" by Keigo Higashino.<p class=message>I'll have to check that out. Speaking of exploring, have you been to any other bookstores in Tokyo that you would recommend?<p class="message sent">Yes, there's a charming little bookstore not far from here called "Daikanyama T-site". It's definitely worth a visit.<p class=message>Sounds great, I'll add it to my list. This trip has been incredibly inspiring for me so far, thanks so much for the tour.<p class="message sent">Of course, it's been my pleasure.
