Welcome to Sydney. May I please see your passport and customs declaration form?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Sure, here you go.<p class=message>Thank you. So, what's the purpose of your visit to Australia?<p class="message sent">I am here for a short vacation. I've always wanted to visit the Opera House and the Great Barrier Reef.<p class=message>That sounds wonderful. Have you made any hotel reservations?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. I'm staying at the InterContinental Sydney.<p class=message>Great choice! Now, do you have any food, plants or animals with you?<p class="message sent">No, I don't. I read the customs regulations before I came, so I made sure not to bring anything that could be a risk to Australian wildlife.<p class=message>Excellent. Thank you for that. Now, I noticed you have a ukulele in your hand. Do you play it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do! I'm actually planning to go to a music store and buy some new strings for it while I'm here.<p class=message>That's fantastic! I play the guitar myself. Maybe we can jam together someday.<p class="message sent">That would be awesome! Do you have any recommendations for good music stores in Sydney?<p class=message>Sure, there's a great one called "Guitar Factory" in Surry Hills. You should check it out.<p class="message sent">Thanks a lot for the tip. That's very kind of you.<p class=message>No problem at all. Now, here's your passport and customs declaration form. Have a wonderful vacation in Australia!<p class="message sent">Thank you very much. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dca1a5db-c945-4431-be0d-950588ca8762.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
