It's great to have you here at our vegetarian restaurant.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Thanks for having me. I'm excited to see how we can work together to provide healthy vegetarian meals made with organic veggies.<p class=message>That's exactly what we are aiming for. How long have you been in the vegetable growing business?<p class="message sent">I've been growing vegetables for over a decade now. I have a small farm where I grow various vegetables without using any harmful chemicals. It's my passion and my way of contributing to a healthy environment.<p class=message>That's great to hear! We can definitely use organic veggies in our meals. What are some of the veggies you find are popular amongst vegetarians?<p class="message sent">When it comes to vegetarian meals, broccoli, spinach, zucchini, and mushrooms are definitely the go-to veggies. They are versatile, and can be used in different dishes.<p class=message>That's good to know. We also have a variety of spices and herbs which I think will complement your veggies really well.<p class="message sent">It's always great to have options when it comes to adding flavor. One question I have is if you are open to including some lesser-known veggies in your menu?<p class=message>We are definitely open to that idea. We always like to experiment and try out new things. What are some lesser-known veggies you would recommend?<p class="message sent">How about including veggies like kohlrabi or kohlrabia, which is a type of German turnip, or celeriac, which is also known as celery root? They both have unique flavors and can be used in soups or stews.<p class=message>That sounds interesting! We can definitely add those to our menu. Let's collaborate and create some healthy and tasty vegetarian dishes for our customers.<p class="message sent">It's a deal! I'm excited to see and taste what we come up with.<p class=message>Me too! Thanks again for being here, B. Let's make our venture a success.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=84743cfd-db6a-41eb-a0b6-6a63eeaf8958.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
