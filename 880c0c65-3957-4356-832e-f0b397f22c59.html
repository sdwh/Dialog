What are you reading?<p class="message sent">Hi A! I'm reading a novel by my favorite author. Have you heard of him?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What is the book about?<p class="message sent">It's about a young woman who moves to the big city and tries to find her place in the world. It's really interesting.<p class=message>That sounds like a great read. I'm actually looking for a book to read myself. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Well, what kind of book are you in the mood for?<p class=message>I'm not sure, maybe something funny or lighthearted.<p class="message sent">In that case, you should check out this book of essays by a comedian. It's hilarious.<p class=message>Thanks for the tip, I'll give it a try.<p class="message sent">No problem. You know, I really like studying in the library. It's so peaceful and quiet.<p class=message>Me too! Plus, it's a great place to people-watch. Look at that guy over there, he looks like he just pulled an all-nighter.<p class="message sent">Haha, maybe he has a big exam coming up.<p class=message>Speaking of exams, how's your studying going?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty well. I'm trying to stay on top of all my readings and assignments.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Keep up the good work.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. Speaking of work, are you teaching any interesting classes this semester?<p class=message>Actually, yes! I'm teaching a course on the history of rock and roll. It's been really fun so far.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds awesome! I wish I could take that class.<p class=message>Maybe you can audit it next semester. It's always great to have enthusiastic students.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I'll definitely keep that in mind.<p class=message>Alright, it's time for me to get back to work. Happy reading, B!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A!
