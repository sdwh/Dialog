I'm doing well, thanks. How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. This is my first time visiting Brisbane.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, you're in good hands with me! I've been driving around Brisbane for years.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you have any recommendations for places I should visit?<p class="message sent">Well, the Brisbane Botanic Gardens are a must-see. They're absolutely beautiful this time of year.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. What else is worth checking out?<p class="message sent">If you're feeling adventurous, you should take a ride on the Wheel of Brisbane. It's a giant Ferris wheel with an amazing view of the city.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds like fun! Do you think I'll be able to see the ocean from up there?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! You'll be able to see all the way out to Moreton Bay.<p class=message>Wow, that's amazing. How long have you been driving taxis for?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for about 15 years now. It's a great job - I get to meet all sorts of interesting people like yourself.<p class=message>I bet you've had some wild rides over the years.<p class="message sent">You wouldn't believe some of the stories I could tell you! But don't worry, I promise to keep this ride nice and smooth.<p class=message>Haha, I appreciate that. I'm excited to explore Brisbane - it seems like such a beautiful city.<p class="message sent">It definitely is. And if you have any questions or need any help while you're here, feel free to give me a call. I'm happy to help.<p class=message>Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. We're almost there - enjoy your stay in beautiful Brisbane!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=37f1299a-f1f4-4f04-87cd-b1f34a5e8002.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
