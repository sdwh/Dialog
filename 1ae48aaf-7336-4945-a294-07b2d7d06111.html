I heard that he was last seen in the enchanted forest."<p class=message>"That's where I was headed too. I heard he might have been taken by some trolls."<p class="message sent">"Trolls, you say? I'll bring my battle-axe for that."<p class=message>"Don't forget, I'm a skilled archer. I can take them out before they even see us."<p class="message sent">"You're right. We make a good team. Let's go find that wizard."<p class=message>"Hold on, let's not forget the most important thing. Snacks!"<p class="message sent">"Snacks? We're on a mission, A. We don't have time for snacks."<p class=message>"You'd be surprised how much better we'll perform with some tasty treats. Trust me."<p class="message sent">"Fine, we'll grab a few snacks on the way. But let's keep an eye out for any danger."<p class=message>"Deal. And if we find the wizard, we should ask him to teach us some spells. It'd come in handy for future missions."<p class="message sent">"Agreed. But let's focus on finding him first. We don't know what kind of danger he might be in."<p class=message>"Of course, safety first. But once we save him, we can celebrate with some more snacks!"<p class="message sent">"I see where your priorities lie, A. Let's get going before I change my mind about the snacks."<p class=message>"Alright, here's your battle-axe. Let's go teach those trolls a lesson they won't forget!"</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1ae45bc0-0850-4f95-a82b-94da208ffa84.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
