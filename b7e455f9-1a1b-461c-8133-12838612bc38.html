We have a variety of items, including postcards, keychains, and t-shirts featuring images from our exhibits.<p class=message>That all sounds great. Do you have any recommendations for something unique or special?<p class="message sent">Well, one item that is quite popular is this replica of a dinosaur bone. It's a great gift for kids or anyone interested in paleontology.<p class=message>Oh wow, that does look really cool. How much does it cost?<p class="message sent">It's priced at $25, but we also have a smaller version for $10 if you're looking for something more affordable.<p class=message>Hmm, decisions, decisions. What about this mug with a painting of a famous artist? It's really interesting.<p class="message sent">That's a new addition to our collection. It features a work by Van Gogh and is actually part of our current exhibition. It's priced at $15.<p class=message>That's a reasonable price for a cool art piece. I think I'll take it. Can I pay with a credit card?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We accept all major credit cards. You can also fill out a feedback form if you'd like to let us know about your experience today.<p class=message>Sure thing. Thanks for your help and for a great visit to the museum!<p class="message sent">You're very welcome. Enjoy your new mug, and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b7e080dd-565c-402a-b08d-905727061d2e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
