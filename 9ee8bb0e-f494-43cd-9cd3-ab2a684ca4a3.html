I'm diving instructor A, and I'm always on the lookout for the freshest seafood. Do you have any tips on where I can find the best catch of the day?<p class="message sent">Well, hello! I'm chef B, and I know a thing or two about seafood too. The trick is to know what you're looking for. For example, crabs are best caught during high tide, while lobsters are easier to find at night.<p class=message>That's great advice! I'll keep that in mind. But how do I know if the fish I've caught is fresh?<p class="message sent">Look at the eyes - they should be bright and clear, not cloudy. The gills should also be bright red, and the skin should have a shiny, metallic sheen.<p class=message>Wow, you really know your stuff. So where do you get your seafood from?<p class="message sent">I have a few trusted suppliers that I buy from. They're local fishermen who know the waters and the seasons. They always bring me the best stuff.<p class=message>That's cool. Maybe I'll check out those suppliers too. Have you ever had any unusual catches?<p class="message sent">Actually, I tried cooking a blowfish once, but it was really tricky. You have to be careful not to touch the poisonous parts, or you could get really sick!<p class=message>Whoa, that sounds scary. I think I'll stick to the more common seafood. Thanks for the tips, chef B!<p class="message sent">No problem, diving instructor A. It was great chatting with you. Enjoy your next dive and catch some great seafood!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9edda256-411d-4155-900f-b3a41dafecbf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
