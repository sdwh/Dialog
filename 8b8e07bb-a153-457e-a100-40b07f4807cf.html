Have a seat.<p class="message sent">Thanks A, I'm doing alright. So, what's on the agenda for today?<p class=message>I wanted to talk to you about some upcoming performance opportunities.<p class="message sent">Great, what do you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, we have a couple of private events lined up, and a few music festivals that we could potentially perform at.<p class="message sent">That sounds exciting! Do you have any preference on which events we should prioritize?<p class=message>I think we should definitely focus on the music festivals. They'll give us a chance to reach a wider audience and potentially book more gigs in the future.<p class="message sent">Good point. Do we have any confirmed dates for the festivals?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'll keep you updated as soon as I hear back. In the meantime, let's work on preparing for those private events.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Any specific songs you think we should play?<p class=message>I think we should stick with some of our popular tunes, but also throw in a couple of new songs to keep things fresh. What do you think?<p class="message sent">I'm all for trying out new material. Let's do it!<p class=message>Perfect. I'll start reaching out to the event organizers and see what other details we need to prepare for.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. Looking forward to our upcoming performances!<p class=message>Me too, B. Let's rock these shows!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8b8afef4-bd7f-49e9-8dec-ff880e7c8d4d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
