How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm doing pretty well. Just trying to figure out how to improve our autonomous driving system.<p class=message>Yeah, I heard you've been working on incorporating machine learning algorithms. That's pretty exciting.<p class="message sent">Definitely. The goal is to improve accuracy and decrease false positives for object detection.<p class=message>Ah, so you'll need a lot of data to train the neural network, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, we're currently collecting and labeling a massive dataset for the network to learn from.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work. But, it'll be worth it in the end.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And with more data, we can fine-tune the model to be more precise.<p class=message>I'm curious about the hardware aspect. Are we going to use GPUs to accelerate machine learning computations?<p class="message sent">Yes, we'll be using GPUs both for training and inference. They're much faster than traditional CPUs.<p class=message>Great! I have some experience with GPU programming, so I could definitely help out if needed.<p class="message sent">That would be fantastic. The more hands on deck, the better.<p class=message>I agree. This project is definitely a team effort. We'll need to collaborate closely to make sure everything runs smoothly.<p class="message sent">For sure. And, we can always order some pizza to keep us fueled for those long nights of coding.<p class=message>Haha, yes! Food is always a good motivator. I'm looking forward to working on this project with you, B.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. Let's make self-driving cars a reality!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=38a68372-a90d-4819-904d-f39d5f554bab.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
