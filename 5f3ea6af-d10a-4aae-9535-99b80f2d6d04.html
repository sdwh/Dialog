What's the plan for today's workout?<p class="message sent">Hey there, A! Today we're focusing on upper body strength. We'll do some bench presses and push-ups.<p class=message>Sounds intense! I hope I'm up for the challenge.<p class="message sent">Of course you are! Just remember to keep your form in check and take breaks if you need to.<p class=message>Got it, coach. By the way, have you seen the new protein shakes they have at the gym's cafe?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had a chance to try them yet. Are they any good?<p class=message>I had one yesterday and it was actually pretty tasty. The chocolate flavor was my favorite.<p class="message sent">Maybe I'll have to give it a try then. But first, let's get through this workout!<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Hey, have you heard about the 5k race that's coming up next month?<p class="message sent">Yes, I actually signed up for it. Are you thinking of joining as well?<p class=message>I was considering it, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for a race yet.<p class="message sent">You never know until you try! Plus, it's always great to have a goal to work towards.<p class=message>That's true. Maybe I'll give it some more thought. Thanks for the encouragement, coach!<p class="message sent">Anytime. Now, let's hit those bench presses!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5f3e89dc-8528-459d-8734-1dd285ef157a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
