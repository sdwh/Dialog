How's it going with the database management?<p class="message sent">Pretty good, A. We've been busy improving our security protocols. We recently had a penetration testing done and found some vulnerabilities.<p class=message>Oh, really? That sounds interesting. What kind of vulnerabilities did the testing reveal?<p class="message sent">It revealed some issues with our authentication process and access controls. But don't worry, we are already working on fixing those.<p class=message>Great. That's always reassuring to hear. Did the testing reveal any other fun surprises?<p class="message sent">Well, it did reveal an Easter egg we didn't even know we had in our system. Apparently, one of the developers hid a mini-game that could only be accessed through a certain combination of buttons.<p class=message>Ha! That's hilarious. Did you guys let the developer know that his little secret had been discovered?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we did. We had a good laugh about it and then promptly removed the Easter egg as it posed a potential security risk.<p class=message>I can see why you guys are always so busy. Maintaining a secure database can be quite challenging.<p class="message sent">It definitely keeps us on our toes. But it's always nice to find and fix issues before they can be exploited.<p class=message>That's true. Have you considered offering any kind of rewards for people who find and report security vulnerabilities in your system?<p class="message sent">Actually, we have. We recently started a bug bounty program and have already had a few successful submissions.<p class=message>That's a great initiative. It not only helps you find and fix issues quickly, but it also shows that you take security seriously.<p class="message sent">Exactly. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=817906b1-d2e7-4586-bb16-54ba40016016.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
