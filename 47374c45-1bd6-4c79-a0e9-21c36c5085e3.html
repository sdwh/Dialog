It's so hot and humid outside.<p class=message>I know, right? It's like we're living in a tropical rainforest.<p class="message sent">I think that's because of the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.<p class=message>Oh no, are we doomed?<p class="message sent">Well, it's definitely something we need to address. Have you heard about the Paris Agreement?<p class=message>No, what's that?<p class="message sent">Basically, it's an agreement between different countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds promising. But do you think it's too little too late?<p class="message sent">No, I'm optimistic. Even small steps can make a difference. Plus, it's up to all of us to make changes in our own lives too.<p class=message>That's true. I've been trying to use public transportation more and recycle more often.<p class="message sent">Great initiatives! Do you know there are other ways to reduce your carbon footprint too?<p class=message>No, I'd love to hear more.<p class="message sent">Well, you can start by using energy-efficient light bulbs, cutting down on meat consumption, and planting trees.<p class=message>Wow, I didn't realize there were so many ways to make a difference. Thanks for the tips!<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Together, we can combat climate change and create a better future for ourselves and the planet.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4735b994-f8ec-4bcd-ab59-e1f24ee5b9c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
