Now, before we start, make sure you do a proper warm up to prevent any injuries. How about we jog around the hills for 5 minutes?"<p class="message sent">"Sounds good to me. Let's get started!"<p class=message>"Alright B, let's start with a jog up this hill. Remember to pace yourself, we don't want you burning out too fast."<p class="message sent">"Got it, coach. Slow and steady wins the race right?"<p class=message>"Absolutely! See that tree up there? That's our halfway point. Let's make it there jogging, and once we get there, we'll start the sprints."<p class="message sent">"I'll make sure to keep my breath steady until then."<p class=message>"Alright B, now it's time for some sprints. Run up this hill as fast as you can and then jog down for your recovery. We'll repeat this 5 times."<p class="message sent">"Got it, coach! Bring it on!"<p class="message sent">"Wow, that was intense! I definitely feel the burn in my legs."<p class=message>"Great job B! That's what it takes to get stronger and fitter. Let's take a 5 minute break and stretch out our legs afterwards."<p class="message sent">"Sounds good to me. Thanks for pushing me, coach. I wouldn't have been able to do it without you."<p class=message>"No problem, B. That's what I'm here for. Let's finish up with some cool down exercises and then we'll call it a day."</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ff2bdf07-ccab-4c2c-b947-bd05d8efe3df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
