May I please see your driver's license and registration?<p class="message sent">Of course, officer. Here they are. Is there a problem?<p class=message>Well, sir, it seems that you were speeding. I caught you going 20 kilometers over the limit.<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm sorry about that. I was just trying to catch a flight at the airport.<p class=message>I understand, sir, but that doesn't excuse breaking the law. Did you know that speeding is one of the leading causes of accidents on the road?<p class="message sent">Yes, officer, I'm aware of that. I'll make sure to be more careful from now on.<p class=message>That's good to hear, sir. Safety should always be everyone's top priority. Here's your license and registration back. Just slow down and have a safe journey.<p class="message sent">Thank you, officer. I appreciate your understanding.<p class=message>No problem, sir. Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class="message sent">Actually, I do have a question. Do you know any good places to eat around here?<p class=message>Well, sir, in my opinion, there's nothing better than a classic Aussie meat pie. There's a great bakery just two blocks down the road that serves some of the best pies in town.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. Thank you for the recommendation, officer.<p class=message>Not a problem at all, sir. Enjoy your meal and have a safe trip.<p class="message sent">Thanks again, officer. You're a really helpful assistant.<p class=message>Haha, I suppose you could say that. It's all part of the job.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1cb78253-3b3d-4813-8d38-beb2241700ce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
