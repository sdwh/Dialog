What brings you to our little shop today?<p class="message sent">Hi! Just passing through and saw your store. I'm a big fan of local specialties.<p class=message>You're in luck! We have some of the best products from around here. Have you tried the Hokkaido milk candy before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's so special about it?<p class=message>It's made with pure Hokkaido milk, which is known for its rich and creamy taste. People just can't get enough of it!<p class="message sent">Sounds tempting. I think I'll grab a pack of those. Do you have any other recommendations?<p class=message>Absolutely! Our dried squid is also very popular. It has a unique smoky flavor that pairs perfectly with beer.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that does sound good. Okay, I'll take some of those as well. And how about that bottle of sake on the shelf?<p class=message>Ah, that's our local sake made with premium Hokkaido rice. It's smooth and flavorful, perfect for easing into the evening.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. I think I'll have to come back for that one when the day's over!<p class=message>We'll be here waiting for you. Have a safe trip and enjoy the treats!<p class="message sent">Thanks so much! I'm looking forward to trying them out.
