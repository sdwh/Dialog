How may I assist you tonight?<p class="message sent">Good evening Chef A. I’ve got a table of four who are interested in some fresh sashimi and cold Japanese beer.<p class=message>Wonderful! We have a variety of sashimi dishes to choose from. Our fish is flown in fresh and served every day.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. What would you recommend?<p class=message>I would recommend our chef's selection platter which comes with a variety of fish such as salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. It’s perfect for sharing.<p class="message sent">Great. And what about the beer selection?<p class=message>We have a number of Japanese beers available including Asahi, Kirin, and Sapporo. Our top recommendation, however, is the Suntory Premium Malt Long Dream beer.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. I’ll go place the order and return with any other questions.<p class=message>Thank you, and enjoy your meal. Let me know if there’s anything else I can assist you with.<p class="message sent">The guests just received their sashimi platter and the beer. They are really enjoying it.<p class=message>That’s great to hear. I take a lot of pride in my dishes and ensuring they are high quality and enjoyable.<p class="message sent">One of the guests is impressed and wants to know how you select your fish.<p class=message>We work with trusted suppliers who source the freshest fish from Japan. I then personally inspect each fish to select the best ones for our dishes.<p class="message sent">That’s a great process. They are now interested in trying your hot dishes as well.<p class=message>Wonderful. May I recommend our Wagyu beef or our grilled unagi?<p class="message sent">I’ll go check with the guests and place the order. Thanks again for your assistance, Chef A.<p class=message>It’s my pleasure, Server B. I hope they enjoy their experience and we look forward to seeing them again in the future.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d2a78de7-24f5-4ea0-adb9-386ad278bcdb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
