I noticed there are still some customers who carelessly throw their trash on the floor. As a cleaner, it's difficult to maintain our cleanliness standards.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Yes, I've also noticed the same issue. I think it's time we put up more trash bins and signs to encourage customers to dispose of their trash properly.<p class=message>That's a great idea. Also, I think it's best to have a designated staff to do random inspections and quick cleanup to prevent any possible accident to happen.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, safety always comes first. By the way, have you seen the new automatic cleaning machine we just acquired? It's supposed to make our lives easier and cleaning more efficient.<p class=message>Wow, that's awesome! I haven't seen it yet, but I'm excited to learn more about it.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! But mind you, it's still in the testing stage. If all goes well, we could have more of these machines to help us keep this place spotless.<p class=message>Sounds like a great plan. Speaking of cleanliness, I recently started using a new disinfectant and it works wonders, especially in the restrooms.<p class="message sent">That's great news! May I know what brand it is? Our team is always open to trying new things to provide the best service we can to our customers.<p class=message>Of course, I'll leave you a note on my next shift. I'm sure you and the rest of the team will love it.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. Your input is greatly valued. Let's work together to maintain the cleanliness of the store and provide a safer environment for everyone.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more, Mr. B. It's a team effort, and I'm happy to be part of this team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3bd4e84e-8369-4a42-8dc1-3c7e045f7f50.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
