However, I'm having some trouble ensuring that we have full test coverage.<p class=message>Yeah, it can be challenging. Have you tried using code coverage tools?<p class="message sent">Yes, we are using them, but I'm not sure if it's enough. I think there might be some edge cases we haven't considered.<p class=message>That's a valid concern. We can think about introducing exploratory testing to cover those cases.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a good idea. But wouldn't that require a lot of time and effort?<p class=message>Not necessarily. We can start with a few exploratory tests and gradually increase them.<p class="message sent">Okay, that makes sense. But how do we prioritize which tests to run?<p class=message>We can use risk-based testing. It helps us identify high-risk areas that need more testing.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Can you explain it in more detail?<p class=message>Sure, we assess the likelihood and impact of potential defects and prioritize tests accordingly.<p class="message sent">That's a smart approach. We can also try integrating automated testing to save time.<p class=message>Absolutely. We should also involve developers in the testing process to prevent defects earlier.<p class="message sent">I agree. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class=message>We should also review requirements and specifications to identify any gaps in test coverage.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a comprehensive approach. Let's start implementing these ideas.<p class=message>Great, I'll set up a meeting to discuss the action plan. Thanks for the collaboration, B.<p class="message sent">Thank you too, A. I'm looking forward to achieving full test coverage.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a0a99534-7199-4913-b190-cc04036ecd9d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
