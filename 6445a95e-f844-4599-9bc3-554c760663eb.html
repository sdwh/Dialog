It looks delicious.<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! It was amazing. The apples were perfectly cooked, and the ice cream on top was a perfect addition.<p class=message>That does sound good! Did you notice any outstanding flavors or ingredients?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! The cinnamon was quite strong and added a nice touch to the flavor. And the crust was crispy and buttery, which I loved.<p class=message>I've always been a fan of apple pie, but I've never tried it with ice cream. How was the combination?<p class="message sent">The combination was incredible! The cold ice cream contrasted well with the warm apple pie, making for a delicious dessert.<p class=message>I'm convinced. I'm going to order one for myself.<p class="message sent">You won't regret it! Just be careful, you might get addicted to it.<p class=message>(laughs) I think I might be willing to take that risk.<p class="message sent">If you like apple pie, you'll definitely love this. It's the perfect comfort food.<p class=message>Speaking of comfort food, have you tried their chicken potpie? I've heard good things about it.<p class="message sent">Not yet, but it's next on my list. I can't wait to see what other delights they have to offer.<p class=message>Same here! I love trying new dishes and exploring new flavors.<p class="message sent">Me too! That's the best part about going out to eat. You get to experience new things and broaden your culinary horizons.<p class=message>(smiling) This apple pie à la mode has definitely broadened my horizons, and I can't wait to come back again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=64440032-a9f6-4357-aba3-2e0a69a12635.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
