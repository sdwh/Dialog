Alright, we have one in the back.<p class=message>Thank you so much for your help. I guess I underestimated the amount of good food I've been eating lately!<p class="message sent">No problem, it happens to the best of us. Plus, dessert is always worth it.<p class=message>Haha, you're right about that. So, do you have any funny stories about customers who've had to exchange clothing?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. We had a guy come in once who had accidentally bought a women's shirt in his size. He didn't realize it until he put it on and it was a little too tight in all the wrong places.<p class=message>Oh man, that's hilarious. Did he exchange it for a men's shirt?<p class="message sent">Yes, we found him a similar shirt in the men's section and he was relieved to be wearing something more appropriate.<p class=message>Well, I'm just glad my situation isn't quite as embarrassing as that one.<p class="message sent">Haha, don't worry, it happens all the time. That's why we're here to help.<p class=message>Thanks again for your patience and understanding. You're making this exchange process much easier!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Just doing my job and happy to help. Let me grab that bigger size for you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ff979995-ad6f-4db9-ae51-1058ac96d8be.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
