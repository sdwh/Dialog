How's business today?<p class="message sent">Hey, it's been great! We've had a lot of customers coming in today. How about your pastries?<p class=message>Oh, they're selling like hotcakes as well! The raspberry macarons are especially popular today.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! Can I have one?<p class=message>Of course! Let me get you one with a cup of hot coffee.<p class="message sent">Thanks! By the way, do you have any new flavors for your pastries?<p class=message>Yes, we do! We just added a lemon curd tart and a matcha green tea cake to our menu.<p class="message sent">Yum, those sound amazing! I might have to try them later.<p class=message>Definitely do! And speaking of new flavors, have you tried our new single origin coffee?<p class="message sent">Not yet, what's it like?<p class=message>It's a Colombian coffee with notes of chocolate and caramel. It's really smooth and easy to drink.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect for me. I'll have a cup of that with the lemon curd tart.<p class=message>Great choice! And may I suggest adding a dash of cinnamon to your coffee? It complements the flavors really well.<p class="message sent">Ooh, I've never thought of that! Thanks for the suggestion.<p class=message>No problem! I'm always happy to help elevate your coffee experience.<p class="message sent">You're a true coffee artist! And your pastries are no less artistic.<p class=message>Thank you so much! It means a lot to hear that.<p class="message sent">It's the truth. Anyway, I should get back to serving customers. Keep up the amazing work!<p class=message>Likewise, good luck with the rush. And don't hesitate to drop by for more pastries and coffee later!<p class="message sent">I definitely will. See you soon, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ac7d17b1-3554-49b1-9ae4-2fe6c3504e17.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
