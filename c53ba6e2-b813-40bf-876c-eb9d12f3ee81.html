It's amazing!<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But I'm always curious about where the ingredients come from. Do you know where this chocolate is made?<p class=message>Oh, I'm not sure. Let me check the packaging. It says here that the cocoa beans are sourced from Ghana and Ecuador.<p class="message sent">Wow! That's interesting. I would love to try more products with ingredients from different countries.<p class=message>Well, you're in luck because the store also has imported snacks from Japan, Korea, and the United States!<p class="message sent">Really? I had no idea. Are those products priced higher because they're imported?<p class=message>Not necessarily. I think it actually comes down to the brand and the quality of the product. But do you always look for products with imported ingredients?<p class="message sent">Hmm, not always. But I like to try new things and explore different flavors. And I think it's important to support businesses that specialize in international trade.<p class=message>That's a good point. And speaking of international trade, did you know that some of the products in this store are also exported to other countries?<p class="message sent">No way! That's awesome. Do you know which countries they export to?<p class=message>Yeah, they export some of their snacks to Southeast Asia and Australia.<p class="message sent">That's so cool. Do you think I could start my own snack export business?<p class=message>Why not? It's worth exploring. I could help you research the best products to export and the most profitable markets to enter.<p class="message sent">That would be amazing! Maybe we could even start our own snack brand one day.<p class=message>Who knows? The possibilities are endless! But for now, let's focus on trying these imported snacks and enjoying the flavors from around the world.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5366919-f227-4d77-a814-25c34f7a71e8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
