Can I take your order?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'll have a café con leche, please.<p class=message>Coming right up! By the way, are you a coffee expert?<p class="message sent">I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I am a roaster. I roast and sell beans.<p class=message>That's really interesting! I'm a barista here, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my coffee-making skills.<p class="message sent">Well, in that case, let me share a tip with you. When making a café con leche, the milk should always be steamed first before adding the coffee.<p class=message>Thanks for the tip! I'll try that later. So, how did you get into roasting?<p class="message sent">It all started as a hobby. I loved exploring the different flavours and roasts, and eventually decided to start selling my own beans.<p class=message>Sounds like a great story. I'm actually studying to become a coffee sommelier.<p class="message sent">That's awesome! If you ever need any advice or help, just let me know.<p class=message>That would be amazing! Do you have any recommendations for places to try authentic Spanish coffee here in Barcelona?<p class="message sent">Of course! There's a small café down the street from here that makes incredible cortado. I highly recommend it.<p class=message>Thanks so much! I'll definitely check it out. By the way, how do you know when the beans are the perfect roast?<p class="message sent">It's all about trial and error. You have to keep testing until you find the right balance of acidity, bitterness, and sweetness.<p class=message>That's a great tip. I'll keep that in mind when I'm studying. Thanks again for all your help!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It was great meeting you, and enjoy the rest of your day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c302d5a8-d8ad-45d4-8a67-33405d13842e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
