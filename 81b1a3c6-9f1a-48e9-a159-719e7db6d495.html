Can you please state your name and address for the record?<p class="message sent">Yeah, my name is John Smith, and I live at 123 Main Street.<p class=message>John, we received a report that you were seen stealing a donut from the local bakery. Can you explain what happened?<p class="message sent">Oh no! I did grab a donut, but it was just a mistake. I thought it was a free sample.<p class=message>John, stealing is a serious offense, even if it's just a donut. Did you happen to see any signs indicating it was a sample?<p class="message sent">No, I didn't see any signs. I just assumed it was a sampler, like they often do at the grocery store.<p class=message>Well, John, unfortunately, you're going to have to pay the price for your mistake. I'm going to have to issue you a citation and a warning.<p class="message sent">That's okay, officer. I understand the consequences of my actions. I promise to be more careful in the future.<p class=message>I appreciate your honesty, John. I hope this will be a lesson learned for you.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, officer. Again, I'm sorry for what happened, and I'll make sure to pay for anything I grab in the future.<p class=message>That's great to hear, John. I appreciate your cooperation. Just a word of advice, always check for signs before you grab anything in the future.<p class="message sent">Yes, officer. I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for your time and understanding.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=81b0b2d3-a0b9-4ec7-92ea-9468e990112a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
