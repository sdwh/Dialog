Why?"<p class=message>"Well, I've been trying to perfect my pancake game but I can't seem to get them fluffy enough."<p class="message sent">"Fluffy pancakes are the best kind! What's your recipe?"<p class=message>"I've tried a few variations with different types of flour but I can't seem to get the right consistency."<p class="message sent">"Have you tried adding baking powder and buttermilk? Those are the secret ingredients for fluffy pancakes."<p class=message>"Really? I had no idea. Thanks for the tip!"<p class="message sent">"No worries. Pancake making is a serious business."<p class=message>"Agreed. Do you have any favorite pancake toppings?"<p class="message sent">"I'm a classic maple syrup kind of person, but I do enjoy some sliced banana and chocolate chips on occasion."<p class=message>"Oh, those sound delicious! Have you ever tried adding whipped cream?"<p class="message sent">"Of course! Whipped cream is a pancake's best friend."<p class=message>"Ha, I couldn't agree more. Do you prefer thin or thick pancakes?"<p class="message sent">"Definitely thick. Thin pancakes just don't have the same satisfaction as biting into a fluffy stack of pancakes."<p class=message>"That's true. Have you ever had pancakes for dinner?"<p class="message sent">"Oh, all the time! Pancakes are good any time of day."<p class=message>"I agree. Pancakes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!"<p class="message sent">"Now you're speaking my language. I might just have to whip up a batch of pancakes tonight."<p class=message>"Count me in!
