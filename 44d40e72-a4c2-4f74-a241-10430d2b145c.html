Welcome to our travel agency. How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I’m interested in planning a trip to Washington D.C. I want to visit the Capitol building and other famous sites around the area.<p class=message>That's great! So, when are you thinking of going and how long would you like to stay?<p class="message sent">I’m thinking of going next month and staying for about four days.<p class=message>Okay, let me check the availability for flights and hotels during that time. Have you been to Washington D.C. before?<p class="message sent">No, it’ll be my first time.<p class=message>That's exciting! You’ll definitely want to visit the National Mall, Lincoln Memorial, and the White House.<p class="message sent">I’ve heard about those places. What else would you recommend?<p class=message>Well, the Smithsonian museums are a must-see. The National Museum of American History has a collection of pop-culture exhibits you’d love, and the National Gallery of Art is also amazing.<p class="message sent">Wow, sounds fantastic. Can we also fit in a tour of the National Zoo?<p class=message>Sure, we can add that to your itinerary. And how about a visit to some popular restaurants in the area, like Ben’s Chili Bowl?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I’m getting hungry just thinking about it!<p class=message>Great! Let me put together a package for you including flights, hotel, and the tours you’ve mentioned.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much.
