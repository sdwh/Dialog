How about you?<p class=message>Same here! But I'm still on a high from the baseball game last night. Did you see it?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I caught the highlights this morning. It was a crazy game, huh?<p class=message>Absolutely! I couldn't believe we won in the last inning with a walk-off home run. The crowd went wild!<p class="message sent">I know, I wish I could have been there. But I heard the hot dogs at the stadium are overpriced anyways.<p class=message>Haha yeah, it's true. But speaking of food, have you looked at this menu yet? I'm eyeing the steak.<p class="message sent">That sounds good, but I'm thinking about trying something new today. Maybe the fish and chips?<p class=message>Oh, good choice! I had that last time and it was delicious. Just make sure to dip those fries in some vinegar, it's a game-changer.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tip, I'll keep that in mind. So do you have any plans for the weekend?<p class=message>Yeah, I'm going camping with some friends. I'm excited but also a little nervous to be sleeping in a tent for two nights.<p class="message sent">Hey, that sounds like fun! But remember to pack some bug spray, or you'll be scratching all weekend.<p class=message>Definitely, I learned that lesson the hard way last time. But hey, at least it's not like the bugs are any competition for the baseball players we saw last night!<p class="message sent">Ha, you're right about that. But speaking of competition, did you hear about the new trivia night they're hosting at the pub down the street? We should go sometime and show off our sports knowledge.<p class=message>I'm down for that! I think we could definitely hold our own in some sports trivia. Plus, a cold beer and good company is always a winning combination.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, it's settled then. Let's plan on going next Wednesday and see who can bring home the biggest prize.<p class=message>You're on! But first, let's enjoy our dinner and pretend we're at a baseball game enjoying some stadium food.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3ce7258a-9bd8-42b2-ad98-8630b5785226.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
