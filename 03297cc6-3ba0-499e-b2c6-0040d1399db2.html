What can I get you for dinner tonight?<p class="message sent message-content">Hi there! I think I'll have the spaghetti with meatballs and a Negroni.<p class="message received message-content">Excellent choice! Our spaghetti is homemade, and our meatballs are a recipe that has been passed down through generations.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds amazing. And I love a good Negroni. Have you ever tried adding a twist to it?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, we add a bit of orange bitters to make it more unique.<p class="message sent message-content">That's a great idea! I might have to try that.<p class="message received message-content">So, what made you want to become a bartender?<p class="message sent message-content">I've always been fascinated with mixology and the art of crafting cocktails. Plus, I love the social aspect of it.<p class="message received message-content">Yes, it's always nice to interact with customers and create a fun atmosphere.<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely. So, what's your favorite pasta dish to make?<p class="message received message-content">I love making our carbonara with fresh egg yolks and pancetta. It's simple but delicious.<p class="message sent message-content">Carbonara is one of my favorites too. And what's the secret to making great meatballs?<p class="message received message-content">It's all about the seasoning and the bread crumbs. And you have to make sure they're not too dense.<p class="message sent message-content">Makes sense. Well, I can't wait to try them. How's that Negroni coming along?<p class="message received message-content">It's almost ready. I'll bring it right over. Enjoy your dinner!<p class="message sent message-content">Thanks so much! It all smells amazing.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0328ac18-57b1-4f45-b693-6fd820adcb14.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
