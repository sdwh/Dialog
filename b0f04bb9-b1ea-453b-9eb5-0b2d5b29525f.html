It's a security management system, right?<p class=message>Yes, that's right. It helps organizations keep their information secure.<p class="message sent">I see. So, what are some of the security objectives of ISO 27001?<p class=message>Well, one of them is the confidentiality of information.<p class="message sent">Right, so only authorized people can access the information.<p class=message>Exactly. And another objective is the integrity of information, which means the information is correct and complete.<p class="message sent">Sounds like ISO 27001 is important for companies to protect their sensitive data.<p class=message>Absolutely. It also helps improve the reputation of a company by showing that they take security seriously.<p class="message sent">That's true. But I also heard that it can be a challenging process to implement.<p class=message>Yes, it can be. But there are many resources available, such as certification courses and consultants, to help with the process.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. Have you ever worked on implementing ISO 27001 before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It was a great learning experience, and it really helped me understand the importance of information security.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. I guess I'll have to start learning more about ISO 27001 too.<p class=message>Definitely. It's a valuable skill to have in today's digital age.<p class="message sent">Thanks for sharing, A. Let's grab some coffee and chat more about it later.<p class=message>Sounds good, B.
