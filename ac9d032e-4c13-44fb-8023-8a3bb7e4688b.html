Do you happen to know if we have a bathtub or just a shower?<p class="message sent">Hey, good question! According to the hotel's website, our room has a spacious bathtub complete with bubble jets for a relaxing soak.<p class=message>Awesome! I'm definitely looking forward to that. How about the water pressure? Do you think it will be strong enough for a good shower?<p class="message sent">I'm sure it will be. The hotel prides itself on its excellent water pressure, so we won't have any issues there.<p class=message>Great to hear. I was a bit worried about that. Oh, and do they provide any toiletries or should we bring our own?<p class="message sent">I believe the hotel provides basic toiletries like shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel. But if you're looking for something specific, it's always better to bring your own just in case.<p class=message>Got it. And how about towels? Do we get fresh ones every day or do we reuse ours?<p class="message sent">The hotel has a green policy, so they encourage guests to reuse towels to conserve water. But if you prefer fresh towels, just let housekeeping know and they'll take care of it.<p class=message>That sounds reasonable. Thanks for the info. Oh, and one more thing: do they have hair dryers in the room?<p class="message sent">Yes, they do. They're usually in the bathroom cabinet or on the wall next to the mirror.<p class=message>Perfect. Thanks for your help, mate. Can't wait to have a nice hot soak in that tub!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, buddy. Enjoy your stay here!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ac97c287-0eac-49ad-b730-f65e784892de.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
