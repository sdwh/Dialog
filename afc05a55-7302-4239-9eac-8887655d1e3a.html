How is everything going?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Everything is going well, thank you. How are you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. I wanted to talk to you about the progress on the Smith project. How is that going?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty smoothly. We've hit a few bumps, but overall we're on track.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I also wanted to mention that our team is going to be participating in the charity 5k next month. I hope you can join us!<p class="message sent">Absolutely, count me in! I actually enjoy running, so it'll be great to participate with the team.<p class=message>That's awesome! I'm excited to have you participate with us. Speaking of team-building activities, have you given any thought to what we should do for our next team-building event?<p class="message sent">I have a few ideas actually. I was thinking we could do a team dinner at a nice restaurant or maybe even a cooking class.<p class=message>Those both sound like great options. I'll run that by the rest of the team and see what they think. Thanks for the suggestions!<p class="message sent">No problem. On another note, I was wondering if I could take next Friday off. I have a family obligation that I can't miss.<p class=message>Of course, B. Just make sure you inform the team and that your work is covered while you're away. Thanks for letting me know in advance.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks, A.<p class=message>No problem. And before we end this meeting, is there anything else you wanted to update me on?<p class="message sent">Not at the moment, everything seems to be going smoothly. Thanks for checking in though.<p class=message>Alright then, keep up the great work. Let's touch base again next week.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=afbbe36a-bc4f-458a-925d-30d892f5d42a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
