How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thank you. So let's get started with today's lesson.<p class="message sent">Sure, what's on the agenda for today?<p class=message>We'll be talking about idioms and their meanings. Do you know any idioms off the top of your head?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think there's one that goes "the early bird catches the worm."<p class=message>Excellent! That's definitely one of the most popular idioms out there. Can you tell us what it means?<p class="message sent">I think it means that if you wake up early, you'll have more opportunities to succeed.<p class=message>Exactly! You're a natural at this. Now let's try another one. How about "letting the cat out of the bag?"<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not sure about that one. What does it mean?<p class=message>It means revealing a secret or a surprise before it's supposed to be shared.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. That's a tricky one.<p class=message>Yes, idioms can be quite tricky. But they're also a lot of fun to learn and use in conversations.<p class="message sent">I agree! It's always interesting to hear a phrase that you're not familiar with and to try and figure out what it means.<p class=message>Definitely. And it's a great way to expand your vocabulary and impress your friends with your knowledge of idioms.<p class="message sent">I'll make sure to practice using them more often then.<p class=message>Great. Well, that's it for today's lesson. Have a great day everyone!<p class="message sent">Thanks, you too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a8d1993d-ef26-44b0-9877-241c3f1ab2b4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
