I'm a solo traveler exploring Japan, and I'm really excited to be in Osaka. Do you happen to be a local guide?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm a volunteer guide. Welcome to Osaka! Is there any particular place that you'd like to visit here in Namba?<p class=message>I heard that there's a popular shopping street here called Dotonbori with lots of restaurants and shops. Can we go there?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Dotonbori is famous for its street food and neon lights. Let's go and check it out.<p class=message>Wow, this is amazing! So many people, and the food smells so good.<p class="message sent">Yes, Osaka is known for its food culture, especially street food. Have you tried takoyaki or okonomiyaki?<p class=message>I haven't, but I'm definitely interested! Which one do you recommend?<p class="message sent">For takoyaki, I recommend trying the ones with green onion and mayonnaise toppings. And for okonomiyaki, the Osaka-style with lots of cabbage and pork is a must-try.<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestions! Oh, what's that building with the big crab on top?<p class="message sent">That's Kani Doraku, a famous restaurant that serves crab dishes. It's been a landmark in Dotonbori for decades.<p class=message>I see. It looks like a popular spot. Maybe I'll try it out for lunch later.<p class="message sent">Good idea! Another popular spot here is the Glico Running Man sign, which has become an icon of Osaka.<p class=message>Oh, I think I saw that on some travel websites before. Do you mind taking a picture of me in front of it?<p class="message sent">Of course not! It's one of the must-see photo spots in Osaka.<p class=message>Thanks a lot. I'm really enjoying this tour with you. It's great to have a local guide who can show me around and tell me interesting facts about the city.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. It's my pleasure to help you experience the best of Osaka. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me anytime.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99ca98f0-a1e1-4083-a33d-596abb5fbc4e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
