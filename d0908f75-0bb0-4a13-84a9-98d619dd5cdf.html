How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing okay, thanks! How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks for asking. So, today we're going to talk about the word "reputation." Have you heard of it before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I think I have. But I'm not sure what it means exactly.<p class=message>That's totally fine! Reputation refers to the way that other people view or think about someone or something. For example, a company might have a good reputation if people think they make high-quality products and have good customer service.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see! So it's kind of like a person's image or standing in society?<p class=message>Exactly! It can refer to an individual's reputation or the reputation of a group or organization. And it's important because having a positive reputation can lead to more trust and respect from others.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Is there anything else I should know about the word?<p class=message>Well, it's often used in phrases like "damage your reputation" if someone does something that makes other people think less of them. And there's also the saying "actions speak louder than words" which means that your reputation is based on the things you actually do, not just what you say you'll do.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it! Thanks for explaining, A.<p class=message>Of course, happy to help! And remember, it's always important to try to maintain a positive reputation in both your personal and professional life.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d08d7e1d-8fe6-4c0e-a153-c4648cc90c0c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
