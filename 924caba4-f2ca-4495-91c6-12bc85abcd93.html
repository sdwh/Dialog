How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was great, thanks for asking. How about yours?<p class=message>It was good. I tried out a new recipe for barbeque ribs. I might add it to our menu if it turns out well.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! We could use some more variety in our menu. Speaking of which, have you checked the inventory this morning?<p class=message>Yes, I did. We have enough ingredients to last until the new shipment arrives next week. But we might run out of country style gravy soon.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll make sure to reorder that. By the way, did you hear about the new restaurant that just opened downtown?<p class=message>Oh really? What kind of food do they serve?<p class="message sent">It's an Italian restaurant, and they're known for their homemade pasta and pizza. I was thinking we could check it out after work this week.<p class=message>That sounds great! Can't wait to try their food. Speaking of which, have you tried the new cheesecake recipe I made last week?<p class="message sent">Yes, and it was delicious! You're really talented in the kitchen, A.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I'm glad you liked it. I'm actually working on a new dessert recipe today. It's inspired by the state fair's famous funnel cakes.<p class="message sent">Yum! I can't wait to taste it. Speaking of the state fair, are you planning on going this year?<p class=message>Definitely! I heard they have a competition for the best fried chicken. I think we should participate and show them what we've got.<p class="message sent">You're right, that's a great idea! We might just win the grand prize.<p class=message>I hope so! We could use the extra cash to improve our restaurant.<p class="message sent">Speaking of improvements, have you noticed the leak in the bathroom ceiling? I've called the plumber to fix it as soon as possible.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I'll let the staff know so they can avoid using that bathroom for the time being.<p class="message sent">You're always on top of things, A. That's why you're an essential part of our management team.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I enjoy working here with you and the rest of the staff. It's like we're one big family.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more, A. Let's continue to work hard and make this restaurant the best it can be.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=924c241e-bb02-4940-b9a7-18791ef36ac1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
