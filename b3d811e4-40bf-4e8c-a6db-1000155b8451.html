It's all about ensuring information security, right?<p class=message>Spot on! It's a standard that makes sure companies keep their data safe and sound.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a big deal. What kind of requirements are we talking about here?<p class=message>Oh, things like creating a risk management system, regularly reviewing security measures, and ensuring that employees are properly trained on security protocols.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of work.<p class=message>True, but it's worth it. Companies that follow the standard are more likely to protect their information from cyber threats.<p class="message sent">I guess you're right. But can't we just hire a bunch of IT experts to do that for us?<p class=message>Well, experts can definitely help, but everyone in the company has a role to play in data security. It's not just the IT team's responsibility.<p class="message sent">You're right. We all have to be vigilant in keeping our data safe.<p class=message>Exactly! It's like locking the front door of your house. You don't just leave it to the locksmith, right?<p class="message sent">Haha, I see what you mean. I'll make sure to keep my eye out for any suspicious emails or activity.<p class=message>Great! And don't forget to use strong passwords and keep your software up to date too.<p class="message sent">Right, right. I'll get to it. Thanks for the reminder, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. Remember, information security is everyone's responsibility!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b3d6321e-6de2-477a-9f71-f6d1988a5acb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
