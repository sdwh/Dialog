I'm a diver and I always look for the best seafood.<p class="message sent">Hi, yes, we take pride in serving only the freshest seafood. What kind of seafood do you like?<p class=message>I love all kinds of seafood, really. But my favorites are lobster and crab. Do you have any tips for finding the best ones?<p class="message sent">Well, the key is to look for a shiny shell and vibrant colors. That's a good sign that the crab or lobster is fresh.<p class=message>That's great advice! What about other types of seafood like shrimp and fish?<p class="message sent">For shrimp, you want to look for ones that have a translucent and firm texture. As for fish, make sure the eyes are clear and the flesh is firm to the touch.<p class=message>Wow, you really know your stuff! I'll be sure to keep these tips in mind.<p class="message sent">It's my job to know! At our restaurant, we also work with local fishermen who bring in the freshest catch of the day.<p class=message>That's awesome. It must be great to have such a reliable source for fresh seafood.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We even have a dish called the "Fisherman's Catch" where we serve a variety of seafood caught that day.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! Can't wait to try it.<p class="message sent">Definitely! We take pride in serving only the best seafood, and it's all thanks to the efforts of our suppliers and fishermen.<p class=message>Thank you so much for the tips on finding fresh seafood. It was really helpful to hear from an expert like you!<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. And remember, the freshest seafood is always the best seafood.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9b32933e-5da1-43b6-b940-951e69110736.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
