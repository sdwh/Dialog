It's so nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi! It's great to meet you too. I'm excited to explore this bookstore with you.<p class=message>Have you found any interesting books on the shelves so far? I'm looking for some inspiration for my next novel.<p class="message sent">Yes, there are so many interesting books here! Have you ever read any Japanese literature before?<p class=message>I have read Murakami's books, but that's about it. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">I highly recommend checking out Yukio Mishima's works. He is one of the most famous Japanese writers.<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea. Did Mishima write anything that you particularly enjoy?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love his book "The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea." It's a beautiful story about a sailor who becomes disillusioned with life.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting. I think I'll have to give it a read.<p class="message sent">Speaking of literature, have you tried any local Japanese cuisine yet?<p class=message>Yes, I tried sushi last night for the first time and it was amazing. Do you have any other recommendations?<p class="message sent">You have to try tonkatsu, it's a breaded and fried pork cutlet. And of course, ramen is a must-try as well.<p class=message>Wow, thank you for the recommendations. I can't wait to try those.<p class="message sent">No problem! I'm glad I could help. So, what inspired you to become a writer?<p class=message>I've always loved storytelling and creating imaginary worlds, so writing seemed like a perfect fit for me.<p class="message sent">That's so cool. And how do you typically come up with ideas for your stories?<p class=message>I usually try to find inspiration from the world around me, whether it's from my own experiences or from observing others. What about you, how did you get into translation work?<p class="message sent">I've always loved learning languages, so it seemed like a natural fit for me as well. Plus, I love being able to help people connect with different cultures through language.<p class=message>That's amazing. It's so important to bridge those gaps between cultures.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I think it's so beautiful when people can come together over a shared love of literature, no matter where they come from.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. It definitely makes me want to keep writing and sharing my stories with the world.<p class="message sent">Well, I can't wait to read your next book!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=93bbb815-c523-4c9d-9555-78264fe4d325.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
