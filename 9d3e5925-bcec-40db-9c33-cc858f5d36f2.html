How long have you been driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon, Customer A! I've been driving a taxi for about 10 years now. Time sure flies fast.<p class=message>That's quite impressive! Do you have any memorable experiences while driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">Well, I once had a passenger who left his briefcase in my car. When I opened it, I saw that it was full of money. Luckily, he was able to contact me, and he was very grateful when I returned it to him.<p class=message>Wow, that's amazing! You're really honest. By the way, do you like your job as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Actually, I love it! I get to meet different people every day, and I enjoy driving around the city. The only downside is the traffic, but that's part of the job.<p class=message>Speaking of traffic, have you ever been stuck in a really bad one?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes! There was this one time when it took me more than two hours just to get to my destination. I was so exhausted after that.<p class=message>That must have been gruelling. Have you ever thought of becoming a professional race car driver instead?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Believe it or not, some people have asked me that before. But driving a taxi suits me just fine. Plus, I don't think my car can handle racing.<p class=message>Fair enough. By the way, do you have any favourite spots in Manila that you like to take passengers?<p class="message sent">Well, I always recommend visiting Intramuros for its historical significance. And if you're looking for some good food, there's always Chinatown or Poblacion.<p class=message>Great suggestions! I'll have to check those places out. Thank you for driving me, Driver B.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure, Customer A. I hope you enjoy your stay in Manila.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9d3c0856-9770-436d-8286-4b391a205ef5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
