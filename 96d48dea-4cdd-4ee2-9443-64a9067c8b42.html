As a food journalist, I'm so excited to be interviewing you today. What inspired you to become a chef at a Michelin-starred restaurant here in Geneva?<p class="message sent">Well, I've always loved cooking and experimenting with new flavors. I also have a deep appreciation for Switzerland's local ingredients and traditional dishes, which I've been able to incorporate into my cooking.<p class=message>That's fantastic. Speaking of Swiss cuisine, what are some of your favorite dishes to prepare?<p class="message sent">I really enjoy making fondue, which is a classic Swiss dish that's perfect for the colder months. I also love working with local cheeses and meats, like Gruyere and venison.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds so delicious. How do you balance tradition with innovation when it comes to creating new dishes?<p class="message sent">It can be a challenge, but I try to keep the flavors and ingredients true to Swiss cuisine while also incorporating modern techniques and presentation. It's all about finding a balance.<p class=message>I can imagine. So, can you walk me through the process of how you create a new dish from scratch?<p class="message sent">Sure! I start by brainstorming ideas and researching different flavor combinations. Then, I try out different recipes and make adjustments until I find the perfect balance. It takes a lot of trial and error, but it's worth it in the end.<p class=message>It definitely sounds like a process. What advice would you give to aspiring chefs who want to create their own signature dishes?<p class="message sent">My advice would be to study and understand the fundamentals of cooking and flavor profiles, but also never be afraid to experiment and try new things. That's how you create something truly unique and special.<p class=message>Great advice. Last question: what's the biggest misconception people have about Swiss cuisine?<p class="message sent">I think a lot of people assume that Swiss cuisine is just cheese and chocolate, but it's so much more than that. We have a rich culinary history and a diverse range of ingredients that make for delicious and unique dishes.<p class=message>That's really interesting. Thank you so much for sharing your insights with me. It was great chatting with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise! Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to chat. I hope you enjoyed the food.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=96ceb75b-b294-4be8-9a13-1323fb221773.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
