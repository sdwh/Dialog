How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well too, thanks. I've just baked some delicious pastries, would you like to try one?<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! What kinds of pastries did you make?<p class=message>I've got croissants, danishes, and some fresh scones. Take your pick!<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'll go with a chocolate croissant.<p class=message>Excellent choice. And what can I get you to drink?<p class="message sent">I'll have an espresso, please.<p class=message>Coming right up. So, what's new with you, B?<p class="message sent">Not much, just getting ready for the busy morning rush. But I did go for a jog along the beach yesterday, which was nice.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. This time of year is perfect for outdoor activities.<p class="message sent">Definitely. What about you, A? Anything new happening in the bakery?<p class=message>Well, we've got a new raspberry tart recipe we've been working on.

Here's your espresso and croissant, enjoy!<p class="message sent">Mmm, this is heavenly. You really outdid yourself this time, A.<p class=message>I'm glad you like it.
