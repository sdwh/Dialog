Can you help me?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Sure thing. What kind of fruits do you have?<p class=message>I have a variety of fruits such as apples, oranges, bananas, and pineapples.<p class="message sent">That's great! How about we display the fruits beautifully on a large basket with one fruit sliced open for everyone to see how fresh and juicy they are?<p class=message>That's a great idea! But how about the pricing? What do you suggest?<p class="message sent">You could offer a bundle deal for customers who buy more than three fruits, or you could offer a discount for families who purchase more than five fruits.<p class=message>Those are excellent suggestions. Do you think we should also offer some samples to taste for the customers?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! People love to try before they buy. And who can resist the sweetness of fresh fruit?<p class=message>That's true. So, how do you think we could attract more customers to our booth?<p class="message sent">We could put up a sign with a catchy slogan like "Fresh and Juicy Fruits" and decorate the booth with colorful banners and balloons.<p class=message>That's a fantastic idea! Thank you so much for your help.<p class="message sent">No problem, it's my pleasure to help. Good luck with your sales today!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6ef80c19-aaca-4ca8-8ead-bab8fe598230.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
