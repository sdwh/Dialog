Let's start with our stand up meeting. B, what have you been working on?<p class="message sent">Morning, A! I've been designing a new landing page for our client's website. I'm trying to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.<p class=message>That sounds great, B. Any challenges you've encountered?<p class="message sent">Well, the client seems to have a lot of requests and it's been difficult to balance their wants with what's feasible in terms of design and functionality.<p class=message>I see.
