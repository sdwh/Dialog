I just added some secret ingredients that make it extra spicy.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. Our customers love a good kick in their food.<p class="message sent">Speaking of customers, have you noticed that couple over there? They keep staring at the meat on the grill.<p class=message>Well, let's give them something to look forward to. How about we cook up some juicy spare ribs and get their mouths watering?<p class="message sent">Great idea! I'll get to trimming the fat off the ribs while you season them.<p class=message>Don't forget to add a dash of our signature spice rub. It's what keeps our customers coming back for more.<p class="message sent">Easy there, boss. We don't want to give away all our secrets. But you're right, that spice rub is the real MVP.<p class=message>It sure is. And you know what else is MVP? Our teamwork. We make a great team, B.<p class="message sent">Couldn't agree more, boss. And that's why our dishes always come out tasting fantastic.<p class=message>Alright, let's not get too carried away with our own praises. Let's just focus on giving our customers a memorable dining experience.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, boss. And with the way those ribs are starting to sizzle, I have a feeling we're in for a treat.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. And you know what else I like?
