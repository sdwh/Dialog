Are you headed somewhere special?<p class=message>Yes, I'm on my way to Adelaide for a business trip. Is this your usual route?<p class="message sent">Yep, I know these roads like the back of my hand. Have you been to Adelaide before?<p class=message>No, it's my first time. Do you have any recommendations for things to do or see?<p class="message sent">Well, if you're a wine aficionado, you should definitely check out the Barossa Valley. It's not too far from Adelaide.<p class=message>That sounds great. Do you have a favorite winery in the area?<p class="message sent">Personally, I can never go wrong with a visit to Yalumba. Their Shiraz is out of this world.<p class=message>I'll definitely have to check that out. So, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's been about 10 years now. It's a great way to meet all sorts of interesting people.<p class=message>That's really cool. Do you have any crazy taxi stories?<p class="message sent">Actually, I had a passenger once who left their pet snake behind in the car. That was definitely a first for me!<p class=message>(laughs) I can imagine. So, what do you like to do in your free time?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of fishing, actually. There are some great spots around Adelaide if you're interested.<p class=message>I might have to take you up on that offer. Thanks for the recommendation and for the ride, by the way!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Have a great trip in Adelaide!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=af9896f3-ea88-4315-a38b-1a8394959ee1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
