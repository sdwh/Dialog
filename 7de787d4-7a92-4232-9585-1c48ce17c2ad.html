It definitely makes things easier when handling events and manipulating the DOM.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What about the backend? Have you decided on using ASP.NET MVC 5?<p class="message sent">Yes, we're going with that framework. It has improved performance compared to previous versions and offers a lot of built-in features.<p class=message>It sounds like we're on the right track then. Have you encountered any challenges while developing with these tools?<p class="message sent">Not really, the documentation and community support for both jQuery and ASP.NET MVC 5 are excellent. Plus, we have a great team of developers to bounce ideas off of.<p class=message>That's good to know. I always feel more confident when we have a strong support system in place. Speaking of which, do you have any recommended resources or tutorials for learning more about these technologies?<p class="message sent">Sure! For jQuery, I highly recommend checking out Codecademy's interactive lessons. As for ASP.NET MVC 5, the official Microsoft documentation is a great place to start.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendations, B. I'll definitely look into those. By the way, have you seen the latest memes floating around the internet?<p class="message sent">Haha, I have. There's one with a cat reading a book that always cracks me up.<p class=message>Oh yeah, that one's a classic. Do you have any favorite memes or online trends?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of the "distracted boyfriend" meme. It's so relatable and always gets me laughing.<p class=message>I know what you mean. It's funny how something so simple can become so popular. Well, it was great talking to you about our website development progress and memery. Let's get back to work!<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, let's make this website the best it can be.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7de6bf7b-3d2c-457c-8c9a-2df069df04d2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
