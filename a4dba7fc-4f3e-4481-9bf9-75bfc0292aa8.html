I need to change my flight to New York, is that possible?<p class="message sent">Of course, let me check that for you. Oh, it looks like there's a flight leaving at 6 PM tonight. Would that work for you?<p class=message>That's perfect! Thank you so much for helping me.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Is there a reason why you need to change your flight?<p class=message>Yeah, I decided I want to surprise my friends who live in New York. Plus, the weather there is so much cooler than here in Miami.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a fun plan! I hear New York is a great place to visit this time of year. What do you plan on doing while you're there?<p class=message>Well, we're definitely planning on seeing a Broadway show and visiting Central Park. Maybe even taking a ferry to the Statue of Liberty.<p class="message sent">Wow, it sounds like you have your itinerary all set. Don't forget to try some New York-style pizza while you're there!<p class=message>Oh, definitely. I've heard there's nothing quite like it.<p class="message sent">Well, I hope you have a great time in New York. Do you need any assistance with anything else?<p class=message>No, I think that's it for now. Thank you again for your help.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Have a safe trip and enjoy your time in the Big Apple.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a4db27b2-b42f-456f-a553-9f87a02657da.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
