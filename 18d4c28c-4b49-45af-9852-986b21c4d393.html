How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, thanks. Just a little bored and restless in here.<p class=message>I understand that. Hospital stays can be quite draining. Have you tried reading a book or watching a movie to help pass the time?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I brought a few books with me, but I find it hard to concentrate with all the noise and commotion.<p class=message>I can imagine. I'll try to keep it down as much as possible. By the way, I noticed you have a sweet tooth. How about I bring you some ice cream or pudding for dessert tonight?<p class="message sent">Ah, that would be great! Thanks, A.<p class=message>No problem. And how about some physical therapy later? We've got some fun exercises that could help improve your strength and balance.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll give it a shot. What kind of exercises are we talking about?<p class=message>Well, we could try some balloon volleyball or maybe use some resistance bands. It's a great way to get moving and have a bit of fun at the same time.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Let's do it!<p class=message>Alright, I'll set it up for this afternoon. In the meantime, do you need anything else? Maybe a fresh pillow or blanket?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. My pillow is a bit too flat for me. Could you grab me a thicker one, please?<p class=message>Absolutely. Be right back with that.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. You're a lifesaver.<p class=message>Haha, just doing my job. Alright, I'll see you soon for some fun and games.<p class="message sent">Looking forward to it. See you later!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=18d2559a-e96c-4205-9a1e-be484a2a9e94.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
