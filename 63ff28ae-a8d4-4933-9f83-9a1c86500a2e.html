How's the designing phase going?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It's going well, but I feel like we still have a long way to go.<p class=message>I hear you. We want to make sure our social media app is both visually appealing and easy to navigate.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I've been thinking about incorporating more animations and interactions to keep things engaging for users.<p class=message>That sounds great. We could also experiment with different color schemes to find one that really pops.<p class="message sent">Yes, I've already put together a few mood boards for different color palettes. We can take a look at those later.<p class=message>Perfect. And what about the functionality aspect? Do you have any ideas for making the app more useful for users?<p class="message sent">Definitely. One thought is to include personalized suggestions for who to follow based on users' interests.<p class=message>That's a great idea! And we could also make it easier for users to organize their friends and followers by creating customizable lists.<p class="message sent">Yes, and what about implementing a feature where users can schedule posts to go out at a designated time?<p class=message>Brilliant! That would be really useful for people who want to post at a specific time but might not have access to their phone.<p class="message sent">And we could improve the messaging system by adding read receipts, so users know if their messages have been seen.<p class=message>Absolutely. And maybe we could even include a feature where users can react to messages with emojis or GIFs.<p class="message sent">That's a great suggestion, A! I can picture it already. Our app is going to be super engaging.<p class=message>Yes, and we want to make sure it's also easy to use. Maybe we could even offer tutorials or guides for new users.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a great thought. And we could highlight new features through push notifications.<p class=message>Love it. We're really cooking with gas here, B!<p class="message sent">Haha, we sure are. This is going to be an app that people can't stop using.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=63fe4c9c-f46c-48fb-aac0-10a2969a5cc2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
