You seem to be struggling there.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much. I'm a bit nervous about flying with all of this cargo.<p class=message>Don't worry, I've seen it all. I've been working here for years. What type of items are you transporting?<p class="message sent">Mostly fresh produce and some electronics. It's all very valuable and needs to be handled with care.<p class=message>I completely understand. I once handled a shipment of art pieces that were worth millions of dollars.<p class="message sent">Wow, that must have been nerve-wracking. How did you manage to stay calm?<p class=message>I just kept reminding myself that I was doing an important job, and that helped me focus.<p class="message sent">That's a great attitude. I think I'll adopt that mentality too.<p class=message>Hey, do you have any funny stories about your time as a pilot?<p class="message sent">Well, one time I accidentally let a bunch of balloons loose in the cabin during a kid's birthday party. We had a blast popping them.<p class=message>That's hilarious! I bet the kids loved it.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, they were giggling the whole time. It's important to make flying fun for everyone.<p class=message>I completely agree. You know, I've always wanted to be a pilot.<p class="message sent">Really? What's stopping you?<p class=message>Well, I've got a bad sense of direction. I'd probably end up getting lost up there.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You can always rely on your instruments to help you navigate. And hey, with all of your experience in handling cargo, you'd be a natural at loading planes too.<p class=message>That's a good point. Maybe one day I'll give it a shot.<p class="message sent">You never know until you try! Alright, it looks like we're all set for takeoff. Thank you again for your help.<p class=message>No problem, good luck on your flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=962ad800-9bbb-49af-a2a5-d78420fd3159.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
