How was your day today?<p class="message sent">Good evening, A. It was a busy day. We had a lot of guests trying our wines.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Any favorites among them?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. The Château Margaux 1985 was a hit. It paired well with your duck à l'orange.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. Speaking of your recommendations, I heard you’ve brought in some new wines from Burgundy.<p class="message sent">Indeed, we have some exquisite Pinot Noirs that just arrived from Gevrey-Chambertin. Shall I pour a taste for you?<p class=message>Yes, please. And since we're talking about new arrivals, have you seen the fresh truffles I got from Périgord this morning?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Are they worth trying?<p class=message>Definitely. I could prepare a special dish for our guests with them, paired with a light Chablis.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a perfect combination. Speaking of pairings, do you have any suggestions for the bouillabaisse?<p class=message>Well, a full-bodied, floral white wine like a Viognier from Condrieu would complement the flavors nicely.<p class="message sent">Great idea, A. I’ll suggest it to our customers tonight. By the way, have you tried the croquembouche that the patisserie next door just delivered?<p class=message>Yes, I did. They’re really good. I’ll make sure to include them in our dessert menu.<p class="message sent">Excellent. It’s always great to offer our customers something special that they can only find here in Montmartre.<p class=message>Indeed it is. And with our combined expertise in food and wine, I'm sure we can provide them with a truly unique dining experience.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A. It’s a pleasure working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bc6e63ea-ee7e-476e-bf81-42e7bbc536c3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
