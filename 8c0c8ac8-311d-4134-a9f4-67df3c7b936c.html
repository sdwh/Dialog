I'm the shaobing maker, and I heard that you're the soy milk maker. Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Hi there! Yes, that is correct. It's nice to meet you too! How's your shaobing making going?<p class=message>It's going great so far! I'm making the dough and adding in some delicious fillings. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm grinding fresh soybeans into soy milk and then adding some sugar to sweeten it up a bit. Have you ever tried our soy milk before?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's really good, especially when combined with a freshly made shaobing. Speaking of which, have you tried my shaobing yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I would love to sample one! I bet it's tasty. What fillings do you usually use?<p class=message>Well, it really depends on what the customer prefers. Some people prefer more savory fillings like pork or beef, while others like it sweeter with red bean paste or mango cream.<p class="message sent">That's interesting! I think I'll have to try both the savory and sweet options. How long have you been making shaobing?<p class=message>Oh, I've been making them for years. It's a family recipe passed down from my grandparents. What about you? How long have you been making soy milk?<p class="message sent">I've been making soy milk for about 5 years now. It's a skill that takes time to perfect, but the end result is always worth it.<p class=message>That's impressive! It sounds like we both have a lot of experience in our respective crafts.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's always great to share our experience and try new things. Speaking of which, have you ever tried making fried dough sticks to go with your shaobing?<p class=message>Yes, I have! They are so delicious, especially when dunked in some freshly made soy milk. I might have to add them to my menu at some point.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! They're a perfect complement to your shaobing. We should definitely offer a combo meal.<p class=message>I agree! I think that would be a great idea. Our customers would love it.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And I'm sure they would appreciate the opportunity to enjoy some authentic Chinese breakfast food right here in Osaka.<p class=message>That's right! We Chinese people love our breakfast foods, and it's a great way to start the day. Thank you for joining me in this effort to bring some traditional Chinese flavors to Japan.<p class="message sent">Of course! It's been a pleasure working with you. Let's keep making delicious food together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8c079b04-0063-4f3c-97e8-1ac66180c090.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
