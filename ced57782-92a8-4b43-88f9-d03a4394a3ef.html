Can you help me out?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! I'm a chef at a local restaurant and I know a thing or two about seafood. What are you looking for?<p class=message>I want the freshest catch possible. I heard this port has some good options.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We have a lot of local fishermen who bring in fresh catches every day. What type of seafood are you interested in?<p class=message>I'm mostly looking for some good quality fish like salmon or tuna. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">For salmon, I highly recommend the king salmon which is caught from this very port. For tuna, we have some amazing bluefin tuna that's brought in from the nearby waters.<p class=message>That sounds great! How about prawns and crabs?<p class="message sent">We also have tiger prawns that are caught fresh daily and the Dungeness crab is a local favorite. It's sweet and succulent.<p class=message>Sounds amazing! How do you cook your seafood?<p class="message sent">Our dishes are all about bringing out the natural flavor of the seafood. We do a simple seasoning and grill it to perfection.<p class=message>Excellent! Can you tell me a bit more about what sets your restaurant apart?<p class="message sent">Well, we take great pride in using the freshest ingredients possible. Our seafood is all caught locally and our vegetables and fruits are grown in our own garden. We believe in sustainable and responsible farming.<p class=message>That's impressive. I'll definitely be checking your restaurant out. Thank you so much!<p class="message sent">Anytime! It's a pleasure to share our passion for great seafood with fellow enthusiasts like yourself.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ced56eb6-1043-4047-a615-2ba31b65fc17.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
