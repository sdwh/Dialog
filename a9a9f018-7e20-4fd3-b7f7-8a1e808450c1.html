How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Great! It's always a pleasure to work with fresh ingredients and make delicious beverages.<p class=message>I completely agree. Speaking of fresh ingredients, have you tried our new lotus seed paste filling for our buns?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. But that sounds amazing! Any chance I can try it with one of my drinks?<p class=message>Of course! I'll make you a jasmine tea latte with a side of lotus seed paste buns. Let me know what you think!<p class="message sent">Wow, this is fantastic. I love the light floral taste of the tea, and the sweetness of the lotus seed paste is a perfect match.<p class=message>I'm glad you like it. What drinks have been popular lately?<p class="message sent">Well, our milk tea with red bean has been a hit. And we've also been doing a lot of iced matcha lattes for these hot summer days.<p class=message>I know what you mean! It's been getting really hot lately. But our baked goodies are perfect for any weather.<p class="message sent">For sure! It's always a good idea to have some steaming hot buns to warm you up on a chilly day. And our drinks can also cool you down on a hot day!<p class=message>You speak the truth! I think we make a great team, baking fresh buns and making delicious drinks.<p class="message sent">Yes, we do! We're lucky to work in a place where we can share authentic Chinese cuisine with our customers.<p class=message>Definitely! It's rewarding to see how much our customers appreciate our food and drinks.<p class="message sent">Let's keep up the good work and continue to make our customers happy.<p class=message>Agreed! Keep mixing those drinks, and I'll keep kneading the dough.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a9a548ac-f928-4c24-ab16-c0ab690d5cf4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
