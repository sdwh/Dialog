Are you here with a tour group?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct. We are a tour group from Japan. Can you please guide us through the immigration process?<p class=message>Of course! First, make sure all of your travel documents are in order and ready to present to the immigration officer.<p class="message sent">Got it. Is there anything specific we should be aware of?<p class=message>Yes, please remind your group to be patient and respectful during the process. Immigration officers are just trying to do their jobs and keep everyone safe.<p class="message sent">Understood. So, is there a specific line we should be waiting in?<p class=message>Yes, please look for the signs directing you to the non-citizen immigration line. And make sure you have your customs declaration form filled out too.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thank you for the helpful tips! Can you tell us a little more about the airport while we wait?<p class=message>Sure! We actually have a wide variety of shops and restaurants in the airport. You can find anything from souvenirs to designer fashion.<p class="message sent">That sounds exciting! Do you have any recommendations for a good local snack or restaurant?<p class=message>Definitely! I highly recommend trying our famous street food- dumplings and noodles! And for a sit-down meal, there's a delicious seafood restaurant just down the concourse.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for the recommendations. You've been very helpful!<p class=message>No problem at all. Enjoy your stay in our country, and if you have any further questions, feel free to ask me or any other airport staff.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6c0f81c0-79ea-43a5-bb94-9e1f1bcf2015.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
