It's really good!<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I'm not a big fan of raw fish.<p class=message>Ah, I understand. Well, the pizza is also pretty decent.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I saw that. It's funny how they mix up various cuisines here. I even saw spring rolls next to tacos.<p class=message>I know, right? It's like a culinary adventure in one place. Speaking of adventure, have you planned any excursions during your stay here?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm thinking of trying out a zip line tour. Have you done it before?<p class=message>I have! It was such a rush. You should definitely try it out. But make sure to hold on tight!<p class="message sent">Haha, will do. Have you gone on any other exciting adventures during your travels?<p class=message>Yes, I actually went skydiving in New Zealand. It was amazing!<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds incredible. I'm not sure if I'm brave enough for that!<p class=message>You never know until you try. Maybe start with something a little less intense, like a hot air balloon ride.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. Maybe we can check out some options together after lunch.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. And hey, if we're feeling really daring, maybe we can try the chili challenge over at that restaurant down the street.<p class="message sent">Ha, let's save that for another time. I don't think my taste buds are ready for that yet.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eae13bc6-6299-4aba-8f5d-e740267e6270.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
