Thanks for picking me up.<p class="message sent">It’s my pleasure. So, you’re heading to Beijing today, right?<p class=message>Yes, I am. I’m looking forward to exploring the city.<p class="message sent">Beijing is amazing, and the culture is so rich. Have you tried any Chinese cuisine?<p class=message>I’ve had some Chinese food before, but I’m always open to trying new things. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">If you like spicy food, Sichuan cuisine is a must-try. But, don’t worry, there are plenty of non-spicy options too.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. By the way, have you ever been to the Great Wall?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It’s stunning. And did you know that it’s the only man-made structure visible from the moon?<p class=message>Wow, I didn’t know that. I’m definitely going to check it out.<p class="message sent">You should also visit the Forbidden City. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the largest palace complex in the world.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. I’m really excited to see all the historical landmarks.<p class="message sent">You know, I picked up a group of tourists last week who were looking for directions to a street market. It's called Wangfujing, and it’s a great place for bargain shopping and trying street food.<p class=message>Thanks for the tip! I’ll make sure to add that to my list of places to visit.<p class="message sent">And don't forget to try traditional Chinese tea. It's a soothing and healthy drink that you can find almost anywhere in Beijing.<p class=message>I’ll definitely make a note of that. You seem to know a lot about the city.<p class="message sent">Yes, I’ve been driving in Beijing for over 10 years. I’ve seen a lot of changes and developments, but the charm of the city remains the same.<p class=message>I’m glad I got you as my driver. You make me even more excited about exploring the city.<p class="message sent">It’s my pleasure. I hope you have an unforgettable time in Beijing.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e38f876-c873-44bc-bf0c-d320fb8d2f72.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
