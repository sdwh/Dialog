My name's Emma.<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you, Emma. I'm the choreographer, Sam. So let's get started. What type of dance do you specialize in?<p class=message>I mostly do contemporary, but I can do some hip-hop and jazz too. What are you thinking of for this piece?<p class="message sent">I've got a vision for a contemporary piece with a bit of hip-hop influence. Are you comfortable with that?<p class=message>Definitely! I love blending different styles. What's the theme or message behind the piece?<p class="message sent">It's all about breaking barriers and overcoming obstacles, both mental and physical. And I want to make it light-hearted too, so it's not too heavy for the audience.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. What's the music we'll be using?<p class="message sent">It's a remix of a classic jazz piece with some electronic beats added in. I'll play it for you now.<p class=message>Wow, I love it already. It's got a great beat to move to. So what's the first move?<p class="message sent">It's a simple jump, but we'll use it to set the tone for the piece. Let's give it a try.<p class=message>This is really coming together! I love how the movements tell a story.<p class="message sent">Yes, I think the audience will be able to follow along easily. Plus, your interpretation of the moves is really bringing the story to life.<p class=message>I think we've got it! It looks amazing.<p class="message sent">I agree. You were great to work with, Emma. Thanks for your hard work.<p class=message>No problem. It was fun collaborating with you, Sam. Hope to work with you again soon.<p class="message sent">Me too. Break a leg at the performance!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b08964e0-f574-4af6-b3ea-8411b08ba0a5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
