I need to change my flight from New York to Los Angeles.<p class="message sent">Good morning! Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Can you please provide me with your booking reference?<p class=message>Yes, here it is.<p class="message sent">Great, thank you. It looks like you have a non-refundable ticket. Would you like to proceed with changing your flight or would you like to explore other options?<p class=message>Yes, I'm aware of the non-refundable policy. I just need to change my flight date. Can you tell me what my options are?<p class="message sent">Certainly. There are a few flights later today that have availability. Or, we could look at changing your flight to a different day altogether. What works best for you?<p class=message>I think changing it to a later flight today will work best. Can you recommend a good place to grab lunch in the airport?<p class="message sent">Of course! There's a great deli down the hall that serves delicious sandwiches. They're my go-to!<p class=message>Thanks for the tip. I'm really excited to explore LA. Do you have any recommendations for must-see spots?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! The Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Santa Monica Pier are popular attractions. But I also recommend checking out Griffith Observatory for a stunning view of the city.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I can't wait to see everything. By the way, what's your favorite destination to visit?<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough question. I recently went to Hawaii and fell in love with the beautiful beaches and tropical atmosphere. But I also love exploring Europe and all of its history and culture.<p class=message>That's awesome. I've always wanted to visit Hawaii. Well, thanks for all your help. I appreciate it!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Enjoy your trip to LA!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d80718b0-850c-41ca-bc74-7da710565351.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
