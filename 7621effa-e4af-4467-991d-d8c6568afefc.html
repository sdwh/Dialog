How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, A! How about you?<p class=message>Busy as always, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Today's menu looks amazing.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's one of our best ones yet. We've got some top-notch wines to go with them too.<p class=message>Perfect! What's your favorite wine on the list?<p class="message sent">That's a tough one. I'm really feeling the Pinot Noir from Oregon right now though.<p class=message>Oh, that's a good one. The duck dish would pair nicely with that, wouldn't it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Your cooking skills never cease to amaze me, A.<p class=message>Haha, thank you, B. I'll take that as a compliment.<p class="message sent">You definitely should. You're one of the best chefs in the city.<p class=message>That means a lot coming from you. So, any interesting stories from behind the bar lately?<p class="message sent">Oh, plenty. Like the time a customer asked for a drink with a raw egg in it.<p class=message>Seriously? What did you make them?<p class="message sent">A whiskey sour with egg white. It's a classic, but still a bit risky.<p class=message>I'll bet. Speaking of risky, have you ever been tempted to drink on the job?<p class="message sent">Never, A. It's a cardinal sin for a bartender.<p class=message>Haha, fair enough. I can't imagine trying to cook while tipsy either.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's definitely not a good idea. But on that note, I think we should get back to work. The appetizers won't cook themselves.<p class=message>Agreed, let's get to it. Another day, another successful dinner service.<p class="message sent">Cheers to that, A. *raises glass*</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=76213b9c-5329-412d-b82a-81286dcbfb96.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
