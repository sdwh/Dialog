Can I help you load those boxes on the plane?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. It's quite heavy, and I don't want to strain my back before a long flight.<p class=message>Don't worry, I'm used to lifting heavy cargo. Is this your first time flying to Tokyo?<p class="message sent">No, I've flown here a few times. But every time, I discover something new and exciting.<p class=message>I know what you mean. Tokyo is a vibrant and bustling city with so much to see and do.<p class="message sent">That's why I always take a few days off to explore. What about you? Do you get to enjoy some leisure time in Tokyo?<p class=message>Ha! I wish! I'm always busy lifting, loading, and unloading cargo. But I don't mind. I love my job.<p class="message sent">That's great. It's good to see someone who enjoys their work. So, how long have you been a cargo handler?<p class=message>About ten years now. It's hard work, but gratifying, especially when I see the cargo safely loaded and delivered to their destination.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. You're an important part of the aviation industry. Without people like you, we pilots wouldn't be able to do our job.<p class=message>That's true. We all have our roles to play. Well, that's the last box loaded. I think we're ready for takeoff.<p class="message sent">Excellent! Thank you for your help, and have a great day!<p class=message>No problem, and you too! Keep on flying and discovering new adventures in Tokyo!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d547e679-9b79-4498-be43-4a750d362c22.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
