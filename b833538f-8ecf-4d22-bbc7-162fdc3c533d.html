My name is Jennifer, and I will be your real estate agent today. What type of property are you looking for?<p class="message sent">Hi Jennifer! Thank you for showing me around. I've been wanting to buy a house with a sea view, and I heard that the Gold Coast is perfect for that.<p class=message>You heard right! We have some amazing properties here with breathtaking ocean views. What's your budget?<p class="message sent">I'm thinking around $600,000.<p class=message>Great! I have a few properties that I think you'll love. Let's take a look at the first one.<p class="message sent">Wow! This place is amazing! The view is stunning.<p class=message>I'm glad you like it. It has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a spacious living area. It's listed for $580,000.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. What's the next one?<p class=message>This next one is a little over your budget at $670,000, but it's definitely worth a look. It has four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and an incredible rooftop deck where you can enjoy the sea view with family and friends.<p class="message sent">That does sound amazing, but I think I should probably stick to my budget.<p class=message>No problem at all. Let's take a look at one more. It's listed at $590,000 and has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a cozy outdoor area.<p class="message sent">This is a tough decision. They're all so great!<p class=message>I know, right? That's the beauty of the Gold Coast. You really can't go wrong with any property here.<p class="message sent">I think I'm going to need some time to think about it.<p class=message>Absolutely. Take your time and let me know if you have any questions. Or if you need a break, we can go grab some lunch and come back to it later.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. Thank you, Jennifer! You've been really helpful.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. Buying a house is a big decision. I want to make sure you find the perfect one.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b830d964-2c6b-4fb9-8e7b-4d2246ba56d5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
