What can I get you tonight?<p class="message sent">Hey buddy, I'm just whipping up some Absinthe for a customer. Have you tried it before?<p class=message>I have, but I always forget the proper way to drink it. Would you mind reminding me?<p class="message sent">Of course! First, place a sugar cube on a slotted spoon over the absinthe glass, then drip ice-cold water over the sugar cube, and watch the drink transform. It's quite the show.<p class=message>That sounds like a fun process. Do you have any other famous Swiss drinks to recommend?<p class="message sent">Oh, absolutely. How about a Swiss Martini with Appenzeller cheese cubes as a garnish?<p class=message>Wow, that's something I've never heard of. Sounds interesting though!<p class="message sent">It's a unique twist on a classic drink. Trust me, it's worth a try.<p class=message>Alright, let me give it a shot. (takes a sip) Oh, that's delightful! The cheese adds a whole new dimension to the drink.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it! Swiss cuisine is all about unique flavors and taking risks.<p class=message>Speaking of which, do you have any recommendations for Swiss food that pairs well with these drinks?<p class="message sent">Definitely. You can't go wrong with a classic cheese fondue or a raclette with potatoes.<p class=message>Yum, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I might have to stay for dinner!<p class="message sent">Don't forget to save room for dessert! Swiss chocolate is a must-try.<p class=message>You're making my job easy tonight. I'll be sure to recommend all of these to our customers.<p class="message sent">That's what we're here for. Making sure everyone enjoys the full Swiss experience. Cheers to that!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=359a0378-c779-40c8-80e1-e1f93b73e7cd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
