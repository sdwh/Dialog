That's not good. What kind of vulnerabilities?<p class="message sent">I found some potential SQL injection vulnerabilities and some vulnerable libraries used in the code.<p class=message>Okay, we should definitely fix those as soon as possible. Did you make any suggestions for the fix?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. They mainly involve parameterizing the SQL queries and updating the vulnerable libraries to their latest versions.<p class=message>Excellent! Those are good suggestions. I completely agree with you on this one.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I am glad that you think so too. I'm open to any additional feedback you may have.<p class=message>Well, one thing we should also do is run some penetration testing on the updated code to ensure that everything is working as expected.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. I'll make sure to add that to my list.<p class=message>Just remember, it's not just about finding vulnerabilities, it's also important to fix and test them thoroughly.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'll be sure to keep that in mind. Thanks for the advice.<p class=message>No problem, B. Keep up the great work and keep those eyes peeled for any potential issues in the code.<p class="message sent">Will do! Thanks for your help and guidance, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3bc2540f-91ca-4a2c-b804-99c18d1613b0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
