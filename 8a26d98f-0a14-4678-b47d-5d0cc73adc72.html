Which one are you talking about?<p class=message>It's the cinnamon apple flavor. It's sweet with a bit of a kick.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. I'll have to try it. Speaking of trying things, have you tasted the dark chocolate we're producing?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's so rich and creamy. I think it's one of our best products.<p class="message sent">I agree. Our chocolate has been receiving great feedback from our customers. They can't seem to get enough of it.<p class=message>That's good to hear. We've been working hard to make sure that our quality control remains top-notch.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We don't want to disappoint our customers. Hey, did you know that we're hiring more staff members next week?<p class=message>Really? That's great news. We can definitely use some extra hands with how much demand we're getting lately.<p class="message sent">Yes, and with the holidays coming up, I'm sure we'll be even busier.<p class=message>You're right. I hope our candy canes will be a hit this year.<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm sure they will. Who doesn't love a good candy cane during Christmas time?<p class=message>Speaking of Christmas, do you have any plans for the holiday?<p class="message sent">Not yet. I might just relax at home and binge-watch some holiday movies. How about you?<p class=message>Same here! I also plan on indulging in lots of hot cocoa and Christmas cookies.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great plan. Well, we better get back to work now. Those gummies aren't going to shape themselves.<p class=message>Right, let's get to it. Thanks for the chat, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, see you around, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8a22c8e9-c106-4033-889b-dc034e1d04d7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
