But before we get into the details, let's talk about the concerns with electronic voting.<p class=message>Sure, we must consider the security of the system and the accuracy of the votes.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, and we need to make sure that the system is user-friendly for people of all ages and backgrounds.<p class=message>Right, and we also need to ensure the system can handle a heavy load of traffic during the election period.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Now, let's talk about the technical aspect of the system. What programming language do you recommend we use for the front-end?<p class=message>I suggest we use Angular for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end.<p class="message sent">Great suggestions! And what about the database system?<p class=message>We can use MySQL for the database system. It's fast and secure.<p class="message sent">Good choice. Now, let's talk about the testing phase. How many testing rounds do you recommend we go through?<p class=message>I recommend three rounds of testing to make sure everything is working smoothly.<p class="message sent">Excellent. Once the system is complete, we can conduct a demo for the agency before the actual election takes place.<p class=message>Yes, and we can also provide them with support during the election period to make sure everything runs smoothly.<p class="message sent">I think we have a solid plan in place. Let's get to work and build an outstanding electronic voting system that citizens can rely on.<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=15e12514-cbf5-48ee-a390-e57ee709e2f1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
