Can you give me some advice regarding purchasing SQL Server licenses?<p class="message sent">Of course, A. What specifically do you need help with?<p class=message>I was wondering which edition of SQL Server should we go for. I know there are many options out there.<p class="message sent">Hmm, well it depends on our specific needs. Do we need advanced performance and scalability features or just basic functionality?<p class=message>I think basic functionality should suffice for our purposes.<p class="message sent">Okay, in that case, we can consider the Standard Edition. However, we should also consider the number of cores and processors in our servers before choosing a license.<p class=message>Right, that makes sense. How about the licensing model? Should we go for Server + CAL or Core-based licensing?<p class="message sent">If we have a small number of users that need access to the database, then Server + CAL would likely be more cost-effective. But if we have a high volume of users or need to run multiple instances of SQL Server on the same machine, then Core-based licensing might be better.<p class=message>I see. What about virtualization and cloud usage? Should we factor that into our decision-making as well?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's important to note that SQL Server licensing in virtualized environments can be complex. We need to make sure we understand the license mobility rights and virtualization rules.<p class=message>Got it. Thank you so much, B. You've been a great help!<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. It's always a pleasure discussing licensing with you. *chuckles*</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0e5f5581-71be-4683-9ab3-a5918956b2e3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
