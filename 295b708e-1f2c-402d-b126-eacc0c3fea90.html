How was your day?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. It was great! We had a lot of happy customers tonight.<p class=message>That’s wonderful. I’m so glad to hear it. What dishes were most popular?<p class="message sent">Well, the duck confit and the steak frites were both big hits. And, of course, the crème brûlée for dessert.<p class=message>Classic choices. I see you’ve been busy with the wine list. What would you recommend to pair with the duck confit?<p class="message sent">I’d suggest a nice Pinot Noir or maybe a Syrah. We have a great selection from Burgundy, if you’re feeling adventurous.<p class=message>Sounds perfect. And what about for dessert?<p class="message sent">A Sauternes or a Muscat would be delicious with the crème brûlée. The sweetness of the wine complements the caramelized top.<p class=message>You have such a good palate, B. I’m lucky to have you as my sommelier.<p class="message sent">The feeling is mutual, A. Your dishes are always so beautifully prepared. I especially loved the presentation on the sea bass tonight.<p class=message>Thank you! I try to make every plate a work of art.<p class="message sent">Well, you succeed every time. That’s why we have so many repeat customers.<p class=message>Speaking of which, did Mr. Johnson come in tonight?<p class="message sent">He did. He said to tell you that the beef bourguignon was even better than his grandmother’s.<p class=message>That’s high praise! I’m honored. Thank you for passing it along.<p class="message sent">Of course, A. It’s always great to hear when our customers are happy.<p class=message>It definitely is. And with your expertise in wine and service, we make a great team.<p class="message sent">I couldn’t agree more, A. It’s a pleasure working with you in the kitchen.<p class=message>And it’s a pleasure having you in the dining room. Here’s to another successful night!<p class="message sent">Cheers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=295a2d72-2083-4aee-bd87-b12cd4e0bc1b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
