My name is Amy, and I will be your tour guide today.<p class="message sent">Hi Amy, thanks for having us. I’ve always wanted to visit this place.<p class=message>I’m glad to hear that! You’re definitely in for a treat. Did you know that the Opera House was designed by a Danish architect, Jorn Utzon?<p class="message sent">Really? That’s interesting. And how long did it take to build the Opera House?<p class=message>Construction began in 1959 and it took over 14 years to complete! The building officially opened on October 20th, 1973.<p class="message sent">Wow, that’s a long time. But it was definitely worth it. The view of the harbour from here is breathtaking.<p class=message>Yes, it’s definitely one of the highlights of Sydney. If you look closely, you’ll notice that the tiles on the roof actually change color in different light conditions.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see what you mean! They look like scales on a fish.<p class=message>That’s a great analogy, actually! And speaking of sea creatures, did you know that the Opera House is home to over 1000 rooms, including five theaters?<p class="message sent">No way! I bet getting lost in here would be easy.<p class=message>Yes, that’s why we recommend taking a guided tour. And don’t worry, we won’t let you get lost. Now, let’s head inside and explore the Concert Hall.<p class="message sent">Sounds great, thanks for the tour, Amy!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ec7dd5fc-bb3c-4cb3-830c-ae323d766234.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
