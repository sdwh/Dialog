I got a score of 800.<p class=message>Wow, congratulations! That's a great score. What did you think of the exam?<p class="message sent">It was tough, but I felt pretty prepared.<p class=message>Yeah, I know what you mean. I took the same exam a few years ago and it was a challenge.<p class="message sent">Did you pass?<p class=message>Yeah, I did. But my score was only 600.<p class="message sent">Hey, don't sell yourself short. Passing is still passing.<p class=message>Thanks for the encouragement. Are you planning to take any more certification exams?<p class="message sent">I'm not sure yet. I want to focus on getting more experience first.<p class=message>That's a good idea. It's important to have practical skills in addition to certifications.<p class="message sent">Exactly. Have you taken any other exams besides this one?<p class=message>Yeah, I took a language proficiency exam and got a score of 750.<p class="message sent">Nice! Which language did you take it in?<p class=message>French.<p class="message sent">I've always wanted to learn French. How long did it take you to prepare for the exam?<p class=message>About six months. But I had already been studying French for a few years before that.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's dedication. Maybe I should start learning a new language too.<p class=message>Yeah, it's a great skill to have. Have you thought about which language you might be interested in?<p class="message sent">I've always been intrigued by Japanese.<p class=message>That's a tough one, but definitely worthwhile. Good luck with that!<p class="message sent">Thanks! Maybe we can study together sometime.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Keep up the good work with your certifications!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6f957fba-4613-43e6-b7f5-a3ed378d2603.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
