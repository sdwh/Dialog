Nice to meet you here. I'm a food blogger from China. What's your name?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm the chef for this restaurant. I'm glad to meet you. What brings you here?<p class=message>I heard that Swiss cheese fondue is the signature dish here. So I came here to try it out. Have you tried it before?<p class="message sent">Of course, I have. It's a must-try dish, and our cheese fondue is made with the best local cheeses, so I'm sure you'll love it.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds really good. I'm excited to try it. Could you explain to me how it's made?<p class="message sent">Sure. Swiss cheese fondue is a mix of different cheeses, including Gruyere and Emmental. Then we add garlic, white wine, and lemon juice to it.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I can't wait to taste it. What should I dip into the cheese?<p class="message sent">We suggest bread cubes, potatoes, and pickles as the best dipping items. But, feel free to try it with anything you'd like.<p class=message>Ok, let me try it. Mmm, the cheese is smooth and creamy, and the garlic and white wine give it a nice tangy flavor.<p class="message sent">I'm thrilled that you like it.
