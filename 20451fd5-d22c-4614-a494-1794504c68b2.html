I couldn't help but notice you're queuing up for the roller coaster too. Are you excited?<p class="message sent">Hey! Definitely excited but also a little nervous. Have you been on it before?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. Let me just say, you're in for a ride! But trust me, it's worth the scream.<p class="message sent">Haha, I'm not sure about that. I heard this coaster has a 360-degree loop. Did you survive that?<p class=message>Yup! It was one of the best parts for me. Just remember to keep your head back, brace yourself and enjoy the rush!<p class="message sent">OK, sounds doable. I was afraid of losing my glasses, though. Did you have any problems with that?<p class=message>I don't wear glasses, but one of my friends did when she went on it. She said to make sure they are on tight and don't slide down if you don't have straps.<p class="message sent">Good point. I'll make sure to tighten them well. What about your stomach? Did you feel queasy or sick at any point?<p class=message>Honestly, I didn't feel sick, but I did feel a bit dizzy at the end. It's like everything was spinning, but it lasted for a few seconds only.<p class="message sent">Alright, I can handle dizzy. But what about the drops? How many are there, and how steep are they?<p class=message>There are two big drops, and they are quite steep, but they're not so bad when you're in the moment. You feel weightless and like you're flying.<p class="message sent">That sounds exciting already. I can't wait. Thanks for all the tips, and I'll see you on the other side!<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. Enjoy the ride, and don't forget to scream your heart out!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=20420968-1a67-427f-9a5c-59c7f26bb155.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
