How's business today, B?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Business is pretty slow today. How's the pancake business treating you?<p class=message>It's been alright. But I think we can increase our customers if we offer a combo meal with your delicious fruit plates.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! We can call it the "Yaowarat Delight".<p class=message>I like it! How about we split the profit 50-50?<p class="message sent">Sounds fair to me. Let's start promoting it to passersby.<p class=message>Absolutely! Hey, did you try the new dragon fruit coming in from the north?<p class="message sent">Yes! It's so sweet and juicy. I think it would make a great addition to our fruit plates.<p class=message>I agree. Maybe we can even add a little sauce to it for some extra flavor.<p class="message sent">That's a great suggestion! You really know your way around food, A.<p class=message>Thanks, B! I love trying new things and seeing what flavors work well together.<p class="message sent">Me too. That's what makes our job so exciting! Speaking of which, have you tried the durian yet?<p class=message>I have, but it's not my favorite. What about you?<p class="message sent">Oh, I love it! The smell can be overpowering, but the taste is so unique and delicious.<p class=message>Well, everyone has their own preferences, right?<p class="message sent">Exactly. That's why we offer a variety of fruits for all tastes. Say, how about we celebrate our partnership tonight with a fruit feast?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! I'll bring some of my signature pancakes for dessert.<p class="message sent">And I'll prepare a special fruit plate for the occasion. I can't wait!<p class=message>Me neither. Thank you for cooperating with me, B. Here's to a successful business partnership!<p class="message sent">Cheers, A! Let's make Yaowarat proud!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bf206dfd-c2f4-4980-ade3-c888ec0c2479.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
