How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm good, thanks. Just a little nervous about starting this internship.<p class=message>Don't worry, you'll do great. So, what brings you to our research institute?<p class="message sent">I'm interested in learning more about the field of neurology, and I heard this institute has some impressive studies in that area.<p class=message>Ah, yes. Our current project involves studying the effects of meditation on the brain.<p class="message sent">That sounds really interesting. What have your findings been so far?<p class=message>We've actually found some fascinating results. It seems that regular meditation can increase the thickness of certain areas of the prefrontal cortex.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's amazing. Do you think this could have implications for treating certain mental health conditions?<p class=message>It's definitely a possibility. We're still in the early stages of research, but the results are promising.<p class="message sent">Well, count me in. I'm excited to contribute to the team.<p class=message>Great to hear! We're looking forward to having you on board. Do you have any experience with EEG machines or fMRI scanners?<p class="message sent">A little bit, but I'm definitely looking to gain more experience in those areas.<p class=message>Perfect. We'll make sure to set aside some time to give you some hands-on experience with those technologies.<p class="message sent">Thank you, that'd be amazing.<p class=message>No problem at all. Oh, and before I forget, welcome to the team!<p class="message sent">Thank you, I'm thrilled to be here!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ee2a943d-2c22-46f9-a5b2-7af818cea236.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
