How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'd like to buy some fresh flowers.<p class=message>Wonderful! What occasion are the flowers for?<p class="message sent">They're for my friend's birthday.<p class=message>Lovely! We have a great selection of colorful blooms. Would you like some roses, maybe?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I was thinking of something more unique. What do you suggest?<p class=message>How about a bouquet of sunflowers or daisies? They're bright and cheerful, just like your friend!<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Do you have any specific colors?<p class=message>Of course! We have sunflowers in yellow, red, and even bi-color! And our daisies come in white, pink, and purple.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a lot of options. I think I'll go with the yellow sunflowers.<p class=message>Excellent choice! Just give me a few moments to create the perfect arrangement for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you! By the way, how long have you been running this flower shop?<p class=message>About ten years now! I started as a part-time job, but I fell in love with the art of floral design.<p class="message sent">That's amazing! You must have quite the green thumb.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, I do my best. It's all about finding the right balance of colors and textures.<p class="message sent">It definitely shows. Your arrangements are beautiful!<p class=message>Thank you so much! Alright, here's your bouquet. I wrapped it up in some yellow tissue paper and tied it with a bow.<p class="message sent">Oh, it's perfect! How much do I owe you?<p class=message>For this size bouquet, it's 35 dollars.<p class="message sent">Great, here you go. Thank you again for your help!<p class=message>My pleasure! Have a lovely day, and happy birthday to your friend!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a0d04c78-3940-4fa6-b626-ebb58a3173f1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
