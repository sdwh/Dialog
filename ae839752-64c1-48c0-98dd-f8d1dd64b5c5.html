How's business at the dessert counter?<p class="message sent">Not bad, A! Our egg tarts and mango puddings have been selling like hotcakes. What about on your end?<p class=message>Our barbecue pork buns and shrimp dumplings are also quite popular. The dim sum lunch rush has been keeping me on my toes.<p class="message sent">Speaking of dim sum, have you tried the custard-filled char siu bao yet? It's a heavenly combination of savory and sweet.<p class=message>Not yet, but I'll have to give it a try. Have you thought about adding any new desserts to the menu?<p class="message sent">Yes, I was thinking of adding a durian puff pastry. Some people can't handle the smell, but for those who love it, it's a must-try.<p class=message>Hmm, that might be a risky move, but I like your boldness. How about we offer a discount for customers who try both the char siu bao and the durian puff?<p class="message sent">Great idea, A! We can call it the "East Meets West" special. I'll get started on the recipe.<p class=message>Speaking of specials, have you decorated the dessert display for the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I've added some festive mooncakes with different fillings, and lantern-shaped cookies for the kids.<p class=message>Sounds like you've got everything covered. This is why I love working with you, B. Your creativity is a real asset to our team.<p class="message sent">Aww, thanks A! I feel the same way about you. Let's keep providing the best authentic Cantonese cuisine and desserts to our customers.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Now, let's get back to work before the lunch crowd starts rolling in.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ae800c90-60d2-4270-80ce-b452012eeaca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
