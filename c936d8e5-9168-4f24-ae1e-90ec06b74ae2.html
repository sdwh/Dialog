Are you interested in touring the Capitol Hill area today?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. What do you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, we have some great options. There's a walking tour of the monuments, a bike tour of the National Mall and a trolley tour that goes all the way to the White House.<p class="message sent">That sounds great! Which one would you recommend?<p class=message>Personally, I think the trolley tour offers the best value for money. You can see all the major sights and hop on and off as you please.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Can we add a stop at the Library of Congress?<p class=message>Absolutely! There's a trolley stop right outside. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I'm excited to check it out.<p class=message>It's a beautiful building, filled with rare books and manuscripts. You won't be disappointed.<p class="message sent">Can we also grab lunch somewhere in the area?<p class=message>Of course! There are some great restaurants nearby. There's the historic Union Station, which has a food court and some fancier options, or we can grab a quick bite from a food truck.<p class="message sent">Let's do the food truck! I want to try some famous street food.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. What cuisine are you in the mood for? We have Mexican, Korean, Italian, and more.<p class="message sent">Let's go with Mexican. I love tacos!<p class=message>Great choice. There's a popular taco truck just a few blocks away that I highly recommend.<p class="message sent">Wow. Thank you for all your recommendations! I'm looking forward to a great day.<p class=message>You're welcome. It's my pleasure to help. Have a wonderful time exploring Capitol Hill!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c93630fe-08f3-4355-83a5-c96d0431e863.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
