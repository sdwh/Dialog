They've been causing some issues in the development process.<p class=message>Well, I've been thinking about some ways we could improve our testing process.<p class="message sent">Oh really? Do tell.<p class=message>I'm thinking about implementing more automated testing procedures.<p class="message sent">Interesting, do you think that would help us catch the bugs more efficiently?<p class=message>Absolutely, we could save a lot of time and have more accurate results.<p class="message sent">I like the sound of that. Have you looked into any specific tools we could use?<p class=message>Yeah, I've been researching some options like Selenium and Appium.<p class="message sent">How long do you think it would take to implement these changes?<p class=message>It shouldn't take too long to get everything set up, maybe a few weeks at most.<p class="message sent">That sounds reasonable. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss the details and get started.<p class=message>Great, I'll start working on a proposal to present at the meeting.<p class="message sent">Perfect, we'll make sure to have all the necessary resources ready for you.<p class=message>Thanks B, I appreciate the support.<p class="message sent">No problem, we're all in this together.<p class=message>By the way, how did the latest version of the software perform during your team's testing?<p class="message sent">It had some issues, but they were mostly minor bugs. Overall, it's looking pretty good.<p class=message>That's good to hear. We'll keep refining the process to make it even better.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's keep up the good work.<p class=message>Definitely, let's catch those bugs before they cause any more trouble!<p class="message sent">Ha, sounds like a plan.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3d7898a6-f7e7-421e-8424-bbb61c647922.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
