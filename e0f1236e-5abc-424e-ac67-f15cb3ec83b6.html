I'm on my way to Adelaide to visit some friends. Have you ever been there before?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes! I've been to Adelaide a few times. It's a lovely city, very clean and safe.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Any recommendations for places to eat or things to do?<p class="message sent">Well, if you're a seafood lover, I highly recommend trying the fish and chips at the beachside cafes. And for things to do, Adelaide has some beautiful gardens and parks that are worth checking out.<p class=message>Sounds lovely! I'm definitely a seafood fan, so I'll make sure to try that. By the way, do you have any favorite music you like to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">Ah, that's a good question!

Speaking of classics, have you seen any good movies lately?<p class=message>Actually, I just saw the new Spider-Man movie and it was amazing!<p class="message sent">Oh, I haven't seen that one yet. I heard it's supposed to be really good though.<p class=message>Yes, you should definitely check it out! By the way, how much longer until we reach Adelaide?<p class="message sent">We should be there in about 20 minutes, traffic permitting. Is there a specific address you need me to take you to?<p class=message>Yes, it's on King William Street. I'll give you the exact address when we get closer.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, ma'am!
