How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm not doing so well, Detective. I seem to have found myself on the wrong side of the law.<p class=message>That's why we're here, to get to the bottom of things. Can you tell me what happened?<p class="message sent">Well, I was at the park and I saw a couple of ducks swimming in the pond. I thought it would be fun to throw some bread crumbs at them.<p class=message>And that's when things went wrong?<p class="message sent">Yes, I didn't realize it was against the law to feed the ducks. Next thing I knew, a park ranger was issuing me a citation.<p class=message>Well, you know what they say, ignorance of the law is no excuse. But don't worry, this is a minor infraction. We'll get it sorted out.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Detective. I appreciate your help. I won't be throwing any more bread crumbs at the ducks anytime soon.<p class=message>Wise decision, Mr. B. Now, let's focus on clearing this up. Do you have any questions for me?<p class="message sent">Just one. Do you know any good jokes to lighten the mood?<p class=message>Actually, I do. Why did the tomato turn red?<p class="message sent">I don't know, why?<p class=message>Because it saw the salad dressing!<p class="message sent">Thanks, I needed that.<p class=message>No problem. We'll get through this together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=00cc1891-ca87-4acb-93f0-91000ddd0c2f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
