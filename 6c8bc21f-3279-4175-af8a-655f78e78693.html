Are you busy with your research report?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I've been trying to gather as much information as possible.<p class=message>That's a good thing. What's your topic?<p class="message sent">I'm doing a report on the history of video games.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting! What kind of information have you found so far?<p class="message sent">Well, I've learned that the first video game was created in the 1950s, and it was called "Tennis for Two."<p class=message>Wow, I never knew that. What else have you found?<p class="message sent">I've found out that Pong, which was released in the 70s, was the first commercially successful video game.<p class=message>Hmm, so video games have come a long way since then. Do you play video games?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I do. My favorite game is Fortnite.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard of that. You know, video games can actually be beneficial for cognitive function.<p class="message sent">Really? How so?<p class=message>Playing video games can improve problem-solving skills and hand-eye coordination.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's good to know. I'll have to let my mom know the next time she tells me to stop playing video games.<p class=message>Haha, that's a good one. Well, keep up the good work on your report!<p class="message sent">Thanks, I will!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6c89cab7-c7ce-4173-93b7-80c14a663cf6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
