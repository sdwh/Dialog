You've had quite a bit of homework lately.<p class=message>Actually, now that you mention it, I have had a lot of assignments due this week.<p class="message sent">Well, it's not uncommon for stress and strain from too much schoolwork to cause headaches.<p class=message>That's true. But I don't really feel stressed, just tired.<p class="message sent">Maybe you're not getting enough rest. Are you getting enough sleep at night?<p class=message>I think so, but maybe I should try going to bed a little earlier.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. Also, make sure you're taking breaks from your work throughout the day.<p class=message>Okay, I'll try to take some breaks and rest my eyes.<p class="message sent">And if your headache doesn't go away soon, we can visit the doctor to make sure it's not something more serious.<p class=message>Okay, thanks dad. I feel better already just talking with you about it.<p class="message sent">No problem, I'm always here to help you feel better.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5c4210a5-629c-4ea9-949f-6a6ceda57e31.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
