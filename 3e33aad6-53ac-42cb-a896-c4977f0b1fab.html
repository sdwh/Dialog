How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. Did you bring any new produce for me to sell?<p class=message>Yes, I did. We just harvested some delicious strawberries and fresh lettuce from our farm.<p class="message sent">That's great news! I'm sure they'll sell like hotcakes. Speaking of which, do you want a cup of coffee to warm you up?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds lovely. What kind of beans are you using today?<p class="message sent">Today's special is a blend of Guatemalan and Ethiopian beans. It's bold and smooth at the same time.<p class=message>That sounds like a perfect match for our produce. I'll take a cup, please.<p class="message sent">Here you go. So, what's the price for the strawberries and lettuce?<p class=message>The strawberries are $6 per pint and the lettuce is $2 per head. We have a special deal if you buy both for $7.<p class="message sent">That's a great bargain. I'm sure our customers would love that. Can I taste one of the strawberries to attract more buyers?<p class=message>Of course! They're so juicy and sweet. I'm sure you'll love them.<p class="message sent">Mmm, they're so good. I might have to buy some myself! Do you have any tips for keeping them fresh?<p class=message>Yes, make sure to store them in the fridge and wash them only when you're ready to eat them. And always handle them gently to avoid bruising them.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice, A. It's always good to learn something new. Oh, here comes a customer. Let's make some sales!<p class=message>Alright, let's do it! It's always a pleasure doing business with you, B. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You too, A.
