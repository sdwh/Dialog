I'm doing well, thank you for asking. Where can I take you today?<p class=message>I'm actually heading to Kyoto today, is that alright?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Kyoto is a beautiful city. Have you been there before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I love visiting the temples and trying out the different street foods.<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm a big fan of street food too. Have you tried takoyaki before?<p class=message>Yes, that's one of my favorites! What's yours?<p class="message sent">I love yaki-soba. There's just something about those fried noodles that I can't resist.<p class=message>That sounds delicious, I'll have to try it next time. Do you have any recommendations on where to go in Kyoto?<p class="message sent">Of course! If you're interested in history, I highly recommend visiting the Fushimi Inari Shrine. The torii gates there are absolutely stunning.<p class=message>That sounds amazing, I'll definitely have to check it out. Thank you for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem, I'm always happy to help. Is there anything else you need to know about the city?<p class=message>Actually, yes. Are there any local events happening today?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me check. Ah, there's actually a food festival happening in Gion today. It's definitely worth checking out if you have the time.<p class=message>Perfect, that's exactly what I'm looking for. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">Not a problem at all. I hope you have a great time in Kyoto!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0397d595-9b94-4543-bc2d-378362930ef3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
