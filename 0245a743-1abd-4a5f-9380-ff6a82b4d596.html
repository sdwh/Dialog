Ready for another day of Node.js development?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm excited to dive back in! Did you catch that new episode of Silicon Valley last night?<p class=message>I did! I'm glad they finally gave Richard a win. It's great to see a fellow programmer succeed for once.<p class="message sent">Totally. It's so rare to see realistic portrayals of our profession on TV.<p class=message>Have you heard of any new frameworks or libraries that might help us with our project?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I was just reading about a new package called "Lodash" that has some really helpful methods for manipulating data.<p class=message>Nice, that sounds like it could definitely come in handy. Speaking of data, have you tried the new MongoDB driver?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have! It's a lot faster than the old one, and way easier to use.<p class=message>That's great news. I've been meaning to give it a try myself.<p class="message sent">Let me know if you need any help getting started with it. It can be a bit tricky at first.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. And hey, speaking of tricky things, did you hear about that JavaScript developer who got lost in the ocean?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What happened?<p class=message>He tried to parse a JSON file from the waves and ended up getting swallowed by a giant whale!<p class="message sent">Ha! Good one. At least we can laugh at our own nerdy jokes, right?<p class=message>Exactly. Hey, I just pushed some new code to the repo. Mind taking a look?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, let me check it out. Looks good! Have you run any tests yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I was just about to. Wanna run them together?<p class="message sent">I'd love to. Teamwork makes the dream work, right?<p class=message>Right on! Let's crush these tests and get back to coding like champs.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0243a87c-968b-4969-9c22-6d3b694f9dd9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
