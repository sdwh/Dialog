How's production going?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. It's going well, but we're experiencing a minor issue.<p class=message>Oh really? What's the problem?<p class="message sent">Our machines keep overheating and shutting down.<p class=message>Hmm, have you tried putting a fan or vent near the machines?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have. But it doesn't seem to be doing much.<p class=message>Hmm, let's think about this. Maybe we could put a mini fridge next to the machines to keep them cool?<p class="message sent">That's an interesting idea. But would it be too expensive?<p class=message>We could always put a sign next to it saying "Do not touch - this is for our production machines" to keep people from taking drinks from it.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. It's worth considering.<p class=message>Speaking of drinks, would you like some coffee? I just brewed a fresh pot.<p class="message sent">Yes please, that would be great. Thank you.<p class=message>So, how has production been overall aside from the overheating?<p class="message sent">It's been steady, but I think we're falling a bit behind on our quota.<p class=message>Have you considered hiring temporary workers to help with production?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. We're in the process of interviewing some candidates now.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm glad we're taking proactive steps to keep up with demand.<p class="message sent">Me too. I'm grateful to have your support on these matters, A.<p class=message>Of course, we're a team. If one person falls behind, we all fall behind.<p class="message sent">That's very true. Thank you again for your help and suggestions.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Let's catch up again next week and see how things are progressing.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ed13ff9-3bc1-47ce-9f20-b23a9404b140.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
