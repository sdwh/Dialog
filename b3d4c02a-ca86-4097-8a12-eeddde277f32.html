Why are you asking about it? Did you just read about it or what?<p class=message>Yeah, I read an article about it, and I thought it was fascinating. It's all about protecting sensitive information, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's all about protecting data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction or disruption.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds serious. But what's so funny about it?<p class="message sent">Well, let's say it's like having a bodyguard protecting your secrets like a celebrity.<p class=message>Ha ha, now I get it. So, how do these controls work?<p class="message sent">They follow a framework of policies and procedures to ensure that information security risks are managed.<p class=message>Okay, and what are some examples of these controls?<p class="message sent">There's password policies, access control, physical security, and many more.<p class=message>It's like a checklist for security, right? But how do you balance that with getting work done?<p class="message sent">That's a good point. But the controls themselves can help you work more efficiently because they keep your information safe and sound.<p class=message>Got it. I guess it's like having a guard dog that makes you feel more secure.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And just like a guard dog, you can train and improve your security controls constantly.<p class=message>Wow, that's quite fascinating. Maybe we should implement this in our company.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's a great idea. We should protect our data like a treasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b3d2a058-fd93-42f2-95b7-6207999f3539.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
