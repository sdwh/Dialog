How's your day going?<p class="message sent">It's good so far, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>Great as well! I'm just excited to start coding and working on this new project.<p class="message sent">Me too. What programming language are we going to use for this project?<p class=message>We're going to use Python because it has a lot of libraries that would complement the project's requirements well.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Have you tried using Visual Studio Code before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's a great code editor that makes coding easier and more efficient.<p class="message sent">I agree. Plus, I heard it has a lot of useful extensions that we can install.<p class=message>That's right. We just have to make sure we have the latest version installed and we'll be good to go.<p class="message sent">Speaking of coding, have you seen any good coding memes lately?<p class=message>Yes, I have! I saw one that says "A SQL query walks into a bar and sees two tables. It approaches, and asks 'may I join you?'" It's hilarious!<p class="message sent">Hahaha! That's definitely a good one. I also saw a video of a programmer trying to fix a bug with a chainsaw. It's absurd, but it got me laughing.<p class=message>That's funny! I'll have to check it out later. But for now, let's focus on this project so we can finish it on time.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6fda1431-f05f-49df-923e-703e54668789.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
