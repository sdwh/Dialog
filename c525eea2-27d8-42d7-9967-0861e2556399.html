It's supposed to keep your network secure from cyber attacks.<p class=message>Exactly! It's like having a bouncer for your computer system.<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah, a bouncer who only lets in the good guys.<p class=message>And kicks out the bad guys, just like in a nightclub.<p class="message sent">I wonder if we can have a themed IDS. Like, if it's a bank, it plays a siren whenever someone tries to hack it.<p class=message>Or if it's a hospital, it could play a heartbeat sound when the system is being attacked.<p class="message sent">That's clever! But let's hope it doesn't give people a heart attack.<p class=message>Yeah, we don't want to cause any harm. But speaking of harm, what happens if the IDS fails?<p class="message sent">Well, let's just hope it doesn't. But if it does, it's like having a sleeping guard.<p class=message>In other words, not a very useful guard.<p class="message sent">Exactly. We don't want to be caught napping.<p class=message>Speaking of napping, I'm sure the IDS doesn't take naps.<p class="message sent">Nope, it's vigilant 24/7. It's like having a caffeine-fueled guard.<p class=message>Haha, I bet even the Energizer bunny can't keep up with it.<p class="message sent">Yeah, the IDS is like a superhero for our computer system.<p class=message>Exactly! It's like Batman for our company's network. Always watching and protecting.<p class="message sent">Let's hope it has a cooler sidekick than Robin, though.<p class=message>Agreed. Maybe we can name it IntrudeMan and give it a cool cape.<p class="message sent">Haha, I like it! The IDS just got a badass upgrade.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5254332-2ef8-4b8d-8efd-d08fbc22769e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
