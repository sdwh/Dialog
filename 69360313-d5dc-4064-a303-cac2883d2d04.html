How about you?<p class=message>I’ve been brushing up on my CSS skills and learning some new software for UX design.<p class="message sent">Nice! What tools are you using for UX design?<p class=message>I’ve been using Sketch and Figma. Have you tried those before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I’ve tried both of them. I prefer Figma because it’s more collaborative.<p class=message>That’s true. But I like Sketch because of its simplicity. It’s easier to work with.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that’s a good point. So, what frameworks have you been learning?<p class=message>I’ve been checking out React and Vue.js. I’ve heard they’re pretty popular.<p class="message sent">They are! React is really powerful, but Vue.js is more beginner-friendly.<p class=message>Hmm, I’ll have to keep that in mind. Which one do you like better?<p class="message sent">I prefer React because of its flexibility. There are so many possibilities with it.<p class=message>That’s true. I’m excited to try it out. So, have you worked with any new technologies lately?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I’ve been experimenting with machine learning. It’s really fascinating.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds complicated. How did you get started with it?<p class="message sent">I started by learning Python and then started working with TensorFlow. It’s been a fun challenge.<p class=message>I’m impressed! Maybe I’ll have to give it a try someday.<p class="message sent">You should! It’s a great way to expand your skills.<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestion. Well, it was great talking with you about our tech adventures.<p class="message sent">Same here! Let’s catch up again soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=69327a51-9e7f-44b9-aa3e-7eb1ddb906a4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
