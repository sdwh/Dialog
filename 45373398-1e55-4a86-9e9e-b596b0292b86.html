My name is Alex, and I'm a solo traveler. Can you tell me about the culture and customs in this area?<p class="message sent">Hi Alex, my name is Kenta, and I'll be happy to show you around. In Osaka's Namba district, there's a lot to see and do, including shopping and trying out delicious street food.<p class=message>That sounds great. I'm interested in trying out local cuisine. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Takoyaki is a popular dish in Osaka. It's a small fried ball filled with diced octopus, green onion, and tempura batter. It's served with a delicious sauce and mayonnaise. We can also try Okonomiyaki, which is a type of savory pancake. Would you like to try these dishes?<p class=message>Definitely! I love trying new foods. What about etiquette? Are there any cultural practices I should be aware of?<p class="message sent">Osaka is known for its friendly and outgoing people. It's customary to be respectful and polite to others. When you enter a shop or restaurant, it's polite to say "Irasshaimase" to greet the staff. Also, it's important to remove your shoes before entering someone's home.<p class=message>Thank you for that information. It's fascinating to learn about the customs here. What other activities do you recommend?<p class="message sent">We can visit the Osaka Castle, which has a rich history and is a famous landmark. Or we can check out the Dotonbori area at night, which is a bustling and vibrant district with a variety of restaurants and neon-lit streets.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! I'm excited to explore this city with you, Kenta.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to show you around, Alex. Let's have a good time and make the most of our trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=45332e73-1712-4fb5-a152-299a803dbcea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
