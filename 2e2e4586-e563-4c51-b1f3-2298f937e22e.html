Your fruits seem so fresh and delicious.<p class="message sent">Thank you, young man! Just picked them up this morning from our farm.<p class=message>That explains the quality. But do you have any tips on how to sell fresh fruits like these?<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed! The key is to let the customers sample them before they make a purchase.<p class=message>That makes sense. How do you make sure the samples don't get mixed up?<p class="message sent">We use toothpicks to mark every fruit that has been sampled. It's a good way to avoid confusion.<p class=message>That's a great idea! What other strategies do you employ to attract customers?<p class="message sent">Well, we keep our display neat and organized. People are more likely to buy if they see everything looking fresh and well-presented.<p class=message>I get your point. And how do you handle any complaints or issues that customers might have?<p class="message sent">We listen to their concerns and try to reach a fair solution. It's important to treat every customer with respect and show them that their satisfaction matters.<p class=message>That's very thoughtful. I can see why your business is thriving. Thank you for sharing these tips with me.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Remember, quality and customer service should always come first.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. Have a great day ahead, sir!<p class="message sent">You too, young man!
