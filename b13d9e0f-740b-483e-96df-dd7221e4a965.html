Are they any good?"<p class=message>"They are amazing! They are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside."<p class="message sent">"I'm sold! Let's go grab some now."<p class=message>"Sounds like a plan! But how do you like your fries?"<p class="message sent">"I like mine with a little bit of salt and ketchup, how about you?"<p class=message>"I love mine with a lot of cheese and bacon bits on top."<p class="message sent">"Oh wow, that sounds like a heart attack waiting to happen."<p class=message>"Haha, I know! But everything in moderation, right?"<p class="message sent">"Right. So, did you know that French fries actually originated in Belgium and not France?"<p class=message>"Really? I had no idea. Do they call it French fries because of the way they are fried?"<p class="message sent">"That's what I heard. But who cares about the name as long as they taste good, right?"<p class=message>"Agreed. By the way, have you ever tried dipping your fries in mayonnaise?"<p class="message sent">"I haven't, but I've heard it's a popular thing to do in some countries."<p class=message>"It's definitely worth a try. It's surprisingly delicious."<p class="message sent">"I'll take your word for it. So, what do you think is the best time to eat fries?"<p class=message>"Hmm, I think any time is a good time to eat fries. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, midnight snack."<p class="message sent">"Haha, I like your thinking. Fries for every meal, it is!"<p class=message>"Well, we better get going before they run out of those new fries. Ready to go?"<p class="message sent">"Let's do it! I can't wait to try them out."</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b13cbf55-da0f-418c-ba7e-843b7c55e0c6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
