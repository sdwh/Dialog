It's one of my favorite Thai dishes. Why do you ask?<p class=message>I just tried it for the first time yesterday, and it was amazing. The combination of spicy, sweet, and sour flavors was just perfect.<p class="message sent">Oh, you're making my mouth water just talking about it. Did you have it with chicken, shrimp, or tofu?<p class=message>I had it with chicken. What's your preferred protein choice for Pad Thai?<p class="message sent">I'm a shrimp person, myself. But it's always great to mix it up.<p class=message>Absolutely, variety is the spice of life. Have you ever attempted to make it yourself?<p class="message sent">I have, but it never comes out as good as ordering it from a restaurant. Have you given it a try?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm planning to. I found a recipe online that seems pretty easy to follow.<p class="message sent">Good luck with that. Let me know how it turns out.<p class=message>Will do. So, what's your go-to Pad Thai spot in town?<p class="message sent">There's this little hole in the wall place around the corner that makes the best Pad Thai I've ever had. But I also like to try out different places whenever I get the chance.<p class=message>That's a great mindset to have. After all, life is too short to eat the same thing at the same place all the time, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Speaking of which, have you ever tried Pad See Ew?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's that?<p class="message sent">Think of it as Pad Thai's cousin. It's similar in some ways, but the noodles are thicker, and the sauce is a bit sweeter. You should give it a try.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=83089e13-d286-4aa5-b271-c922aac4b9a6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
