I hope you have good weather for it. By the way, have you tried our new blueberry scones?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've heard they're really good. I'm going to have to try one on my break.<p class="message sent">They are delicious! Oh, speaking of breaks, have you heard about the new yoga studio that just opened up down the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't heard about it. What's it like?<p class="message sent">It's supposed to be really nice, with lots of classes for different levels. I'm thinking about checking it out this week.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. You'll have to let me know how it goes.<p class="message sent">Definitely.
