How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hello. I apologize for bothering you, but I need some guidance on choosing the right medication for my baby.<p class=message>No problem at all. What symptoms is your baby displaying?<p class="message sent">Well, he has been running a fever and has been very fussy lately.<p class=message>Okay, those are common signs of a cold or flu. Have you taken his temperature?<p class="message sent">Yes, his temperature has been consistently around 101 degrees Fahrenheit.<p class=message>I recommend giving him acetaminophen, which can bring down his fever and provide relief for any pain or discomfort. Always read the label and follow the dosage instructions.<p class="message sent">Great, thank you. Are there any other over-the-counter options I should consider?<p class=message>If your baby has a cough, you can try a cough syrup with dextromethorphan. It can soothe his throat and reduce the frequency of his cough.<p class="message sent">That sounds good. I want to make sure I'm giving him the right dose. Can you help me calculate the amount?<p class=message>Of course. I will calculate the correct dose based on his weight and age, and provide you with a measuring device for accuracy.<p class="message sent">Perfect, thank you so much for your help.<p class=message>You're welcome. Remember, if your baby's symptoms persist or worsen, you should consult a pediatrician.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thank you again.<p class=message>Not a problem. Have a good day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=55cbca40-494c-41ca-907f-927d9efc76b1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
