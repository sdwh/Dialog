Today we're going to talk about something that's been on everybody's mind - procrastination.<p class="message sent">Uh, the topic we all know too well, right?<p class=message>That's right. There's a reason why we all know it too well - because we've all been guilty of it at some point.<p class="message sent">I know I have, especially when it comes to studying for exams.<p class=message>Yes, studying can be tough, but procrastinating only makes it tougher. Do you have any tips for overcoming procrastination?<p class="message sent">Well, I find that breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces helps me not feel as overwhelmed.<p class=message>That's a great tip. Another one is to use a timer. Set a timer for 25 minutes and focus completely on the task at hand. Then take a five-minute break and do it again.<p class="message sent">I'll have to try that.<p class=message>Speaking of breaks, did you guys hear about the guy who invented Lifesavers?<p class="message sent">No, what happened?<p class=message>He made them so that people could enjoy a sweet treat while quitting smoking. The original flavors were peppermint and menthol.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. I guess that's how they got their name too. They're like "lifesavers" for people trying to quit smoking.<p class=message>Exactly. Well, that's all the time we have for today. Remember, don't wait until the last minute to tackle your tasks. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You too, thanks for the class!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ac5f1db-5c0b-4ddc-b25c-ff92fd47678d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
