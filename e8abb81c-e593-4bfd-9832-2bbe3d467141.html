I see you're teaching the kids about farming today.<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I think it's important for them to understand where their food comes from.<p class=message>Absolutely. I'm just a farmer, but I think it's great that they're getting exposure to agriculture.<p class="message sent">Your experience is valuable too. Do you have any tips for the students?<p class=message>Well, one thing I always tell people is to rotate their crops. It helps keep the soil healthy.<p class="message sent">That's a great point. Crop rotation can also reduce pest problems.<p class=message>Definitely. And speaking of pests, have you shown the kids how to use natural methods to control them?<p class="message sent">Yes, we talked about using things like ladybugs and praying mantises instead of harmful chemicals.<p class=message>That's awesome. I think it's important to teach kids about sustainable farming practices.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's also important for them to understand that farming is hard work, but it can be very rewarding.<p class=message>Yeah, there's nothing quite like the feeling of seeing a successful harvest after all that hard work.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And the more we can teach kids about farming, the better equipped they'll be to make sustainable food choices as they grow older.<p class=message>Couldn't have said it better myself. Keep up the great work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e89e99b5-417b-4b7d-ab14-08b7b6a00e9b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
