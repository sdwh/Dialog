Are you making progress on the project we discussed last week?<p class="message sent">Hi A, yes, the project is moving along quite nicely. I've completed the first few tasks and am currently working on the next set.<p class=message>Great to hear that, B. Do you need any resources or support from me to help you finish the project on time?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was just going to ask you about that. I need a few more software licenses to complete the project.<p class=message>No problem, B. I'll have that arranged for you. On another note, I heard that you went on vacation last week. How was it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I went to Bali with my family. It was phenomenal. The beaches, the culture, and the food were all amazing.<p class=message>That sounds like an incredible experience. Did you get the chance to try any of the local cuisine?<p class="message sent">Yes, we tried a lot of different dishes. My personal favorite was the Nasi Goreng. It's a fried rice dish with shrimp, chicken, and various spices.<p class=message>Oh wow, that sounds delicious. I'll have to try it sometime. Speaking of food, are you interested in trying out the new Mexican place that just opened up down the street?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I love Mexican food. When should we go?<p class=message>How about we plan for lunch next Tuesday? I'll send out a calendar invite.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, I'll look forward to it. Thanks, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Keep up the good work on the project, and let me know if you need any further support.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8e6fbee1-f3ae-45b8-8a12-35da760852a3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
