How's business today?<p class="message sent">Hi A! Great, we've had quite a few customers come in already. How about you?<p class=message>Same here, actually. I'm excited to put some new pastries on display today.<p class="message sent">That's always exciting! What do you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, I've been experimenting with some different flavors and textures. I think my favorite so far is a lemon lavender tart.<p class="message sent">Ooh, that sounds delicious. I can't wait to try it.<p class=message>I also made some mini Ã©clairs with a matcha cream filling. They're a bit unconventional, but I think people will like them.<p class="message sent">I'm sure they will! Speaking of unique flavors, have you tried the new coffee blend we just got in?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's it like?<p class="message sent">It's a blend of Ethiopian and Brazilian beans, with notes of dark chocolate and blackberry.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. Can I try a cup?<p class="message sent">Of course! I'll make one for you right now.<p class=message>Thanks so much, B. *sips coffee* Mmm, this is delicious. You're right, the blackberry flavor really comes through.<p class="message sent">I told you! It's definitely my favorite blend we've had so far.<p class=message>I can see why. Hmm, I wonder if we can create a pastry that complements the coffee's flavors.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Maybe something with dark chocolate and berries?<p class=message>Yes, or maybe a berry cream filling with a cocoa powder dusting on top.<p class="message sent">I like it! Let's give it a try and see how it turns out.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. It's always fun to experiment with new flavor combinations.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. That's what keeps things interesting around here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6f42593e-492c-434c-9b07-96ebe306e8fa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
