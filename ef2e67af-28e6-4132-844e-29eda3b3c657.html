What's it like?<p class=message>It's amazing! It's a deep-fried dough with a filling of shredded chicken and cream cheese. It's crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds delicious! Where can I find them?<p class=message>There are many Brazilian restaurants that serve Coxinhas, and some fast food places are offering them too. You should give it a try!<p class="message sent">Do you think it's healthy?<p class=message>Umm, I don't think so, but who cares when it's so tasty, right? Everything in moderation.<p class="message sent">I agree! What other fillings can you have besides chicken?<p class=message>You can have beef, shrimp, cheese, or even chocolate! It sounds weird, but it's actually really good.<p class="message sent">Wow, I'm impressed by its versatility. I'll definitely try it soon.<p class=message>You should! And you can also try its cousin, Risoles. It's similar to Coxinha but with a different shape and fillings like ham and cheese.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendation! I'll give them a shot.<p class=message>No worries! You won't regret it. Coxinhas are my go-to snack, and I can't get enough of them.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ef2c987a-3a9f-4e59-862a-925313eebaa6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
