I hope everyone had a good weekend. Today, we'll be discussing the different types of personalities.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting! What are some of the personality types we'll be talking about?<p class=message>We'll be discussing extroverts, introverts, and ambiverts. Have you heard of them before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! I think I might be an ambivert actually.<p class=message>Really? That's interesting. Why do you think you're an ambivert?<p class="message sent">Well, I enjoy spending time with friends and meeting new people, but I also need some alone time to recharge.<p class=message>That's a great example of an ambivert. Does anyone else feel the same way as B?<p class=message>It's great to see so many different personalities in this classroom! Now, let's talk about some famous people who are known for their personalities.<p class="message sent">Can we talk about Oprah Winfrey? I think she's such an inspiring person.<p class=message>Yes, that's a great idea! Oprah is definitely an amazing person. What do you think makes her personality unique?<p class="message sent">I think she has a great mix of confidence, kindness, and intelligence. She's also not afraid to speak her mind and stand up for what she believes in.<p class=message>Absolutely. Oprah is definitely an extrovert, but she also has a lot of empathy and understanding for others. It's important to remember that personality types aren't always black and white, it's more about how we relate to the world around us.<p class="message sent">That's a great point, thank you for sharing that with us.<p class=message>No problem! Now, let's break up into groups and discuss some other famous personalities. Have fun!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6fbb5f72-ef28-4a5b-a105-8c3e48ec4c24.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
