I've been having some trouble breathing lately, and I think I might have asthma.<p class="message sent">Hello. Let's take a look. Do you have any wheezing or coughing?<p class=message>Yeah, actually. Especially at night.<p class="message sent">Okay, that's a common symptom of asthma. We'll do a spirometry test to check for any airway obstruction.<p class=message>Spirometry? Is that like blowing into a tube?<p class="message sent">That's right. You'll have to take a deep breath in and exhale as hard as you can. It's painless and takes only a few minutes.<p class=message>Sounds easy enough. So, what can be done for asthma treatment?<p class="message sent">There are a few different methods, including inhalers and steroids. We'll find the best option for you based on your symptoms and lifestyle.<p class=message>I'm a bit worried about using inhalers. Will it affect my day-to-day activities?<p class="message sent">Not at all. In fact, using an inhaler can help you lead a normal life. Your asthma will be under control, and you'll be able to breathe easily.<p class=message>Great! I definitely want to feel better. How often will I need to see you for check-ups?<p class="message sent">It depends on the severity of your asthma, but generally we like to monitor our patients every three to six months.<p class=message>That's fine with me. Thank you so much for your help, doctor.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Take good care of yourself and don't hesitate to contact me if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=db0179cb-7596-47e7-aa3d-50bf8a4f32e5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
