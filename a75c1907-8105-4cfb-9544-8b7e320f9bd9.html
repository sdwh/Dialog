It's great to meet you. I'm the network engineer for this financial institution.<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you too. I'm the cybersecurity expert. I heard that we're both here to discuss how to keep our clients' data safe from hackers.<p class=message>Yes, that's correct. I think the first step should be to have strict password policies in place. We should also enforce two-factor authentication for added security.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And we should also conduct regular audits to ensure that our systems are running smoothly and securely.<p class=message>Right. And in addition to that, we can also invest in firewalls and anti-virus software to prevent any malicious attacks.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's also important to educate our customers about the importance of protecting their data by avoiding suspicious email links and using secure Wi-Fi connections.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. It's amazing how a little bit of common sense can go a long way in keeping our clients' data safe.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of common sense, we should also make sure that our staff are thoroughly trained in data protection so that there are no inadvertent breaches.<p class=message>That's a good point. It's important to have everyone on the same page when it comes to security.<p class="message sent">Exactly. Well, it looks like we've got a solid plan in place. Thanks for the great conversation!<p class=message>My pleasure. It was great talking with you, and I'm feeling more confident in our security measures now.<p class="message sent">Same here. Have a great day!<p class=message>You too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a756efd2-6e89-4e09-bca3-14edb7617ca0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
