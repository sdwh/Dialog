Welcome to our restaurant in Siam. I'm the manager here. Are you excited to learn how to make our famous Thai-style braised pork belly today?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! I love Thai food, and I've always wanted to learn how to cook red braised meat properly.<p class=message>Well, you've come to the right place! We have some of the best chefs in the country, and they'll be happy to teach you. Let's start by preparing the ingredients.<p class="message sent">Sounds good! What do we need?<p class=message>Some key ingredients include pork belly, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, ginger, cinnamon, star anise, and dried chilli peppers.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a lot of spices! I'm not used to cooking with so many of them.<p class=message>Don't worry, we'll walk you through it. Plus, the aromas will be amazing!<p class="message sent">I can't wait! What about the veggies for the side dish?<p class=message>We'll be cooking up some stir-fried vegetables, including bok choy, mushrooms, and Chinese cabbage. It's a great complement to the rich, fatty pork belly.<p class="message sent">It all sounds delicious. Let's get started!<p class=message>Awesome. First, we'll need to marinate the pork belly for a few hours to get it nice and flavorful. Then, we'll cook it slowly and carefully in the sauce until it's soft and tender.<p class="message sent">I'm sure I'll learn a lot from this experience. I can't wait to try the final product.<p class=message>Great attitude, B! Cooking is all about learning and experimenting. And after today, you'll have a new dish to add to your repertoire.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! I'm glad I came here today.<p class=message>We're happy to have you. I'm excited to see how it turns out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7f1a15d8-0a9e-429d-b968-13baaef38587.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
