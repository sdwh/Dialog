Welcome to our little fish grill joint here at Clarke Quay. What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">Hello, my friend! I heard great things about your grilled fish, so I thought I would try some out.<p class=message>Oh, that's excellent to hear! We've got plenty of options to choose from. What kind of fish would you like?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about the sea bass? That sounds amazing.<p class=message>Great choice! And while you're at it, why not try out one of our locally brewed beers? They're the perfect complement to our fish dishes.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! I'm a beer brewer myself, so I can't wait to see what you've got in store.<p class=message>You don't say! Well, we've got plenty of options from light lagers to hoppy IPAs. I'm sure we'll have something to tickle your fancy.<p class="message sent">I'm intrigued. Can you tell me more about the beer brewing process?<p class=message>Of course! It's a lengthy one, but in a nutshell, we start with malted barley, add water and yeast, boil it all together, add hops for flavor, then let it ferment for a few weeks. And voila, beer!<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like quite the process. I'll definitely have to come by your brewery and check it out sometime.<p class=message>Absolutely! And in return, you'll have to let me know what you think of our sea bass and beer combo.<p class="message sent">Deal! *chuckles*<p class="message sent">This sea bass is incredible! And this IPA balances it out perfectly. I'm impressed.<p class=message>So glad to hear that! We pride ourselves on using the freshest ingredients and local touches whenever we can.<p class="message sent">Well, it definitely shows in the food and drink. Keep up the great work!<p class=message>Thanks, friend! And let us know if there's anything else we can get for you.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely be back for more. Cheers!<p class=message>Cheers to that! Thanks for coming by.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=348dbd9b-8fce-4e66-beaf-62f0b427f61d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
