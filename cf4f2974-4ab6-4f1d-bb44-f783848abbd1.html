I'm glad you want to learn ASP.NET MVC. It's a powerful platform for building web applications.<p class="message sent">Yes, I've heard that it's widely used in the industry. But I'm not sure where to start.<p class=message>Well, first you need to have some knowledge of C# and HTML. Do you have any experience with those?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've learned some basics in my programming classes.<p class=message>Great! That's a good foundation. Now, you can start by creating a new ASP.NET MVC project in Visual Studio.<p class="message sent">Okay, and then what should I do?<p class=message>You'll see that the project contains several folders, such as Models, Views, and Controllers. These represent the different components of a web app.<p class="message sent">I see. And how do they work together?<p class=message>The Models contain the business logic and data access code, the Views contain the UI, and the Controllers connect them by handling user requests.<p class="message sent">Got it. And what about routing?<p class=message>Ah yes, routing is an important concept in MVC. It determines how the app maps URLs to Controllers and Actions.<p class="message sent">That sounds a bit confusing.<p class=message>It's not too bad once you get the hang of it. Just think of it like a map that helps users navigate your app.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll try to keep that in mind.<p class=message>Don't worry, there are plenty of resources online to help you learn ASP.NET MVC. You can also find sample projects and code snippets on GitHub.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice. I'm excited to start working on my first MVC app!<p class=message>You're welcome! Have fun and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cf4d7f48-fc05-452f-b509-2fe82eae8b3e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
