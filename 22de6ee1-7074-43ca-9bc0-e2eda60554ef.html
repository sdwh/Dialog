By the way, have you tried the new coffee shop in Terminal A? I heard they serve amazing coffee.<p class="message sent">Really? I have not tried it yet. Maybe I will check it out during my lunch break.<p class=message>You should. I recommend the latte, it's my favorite.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendation, I'll definitely try it out. Hey, speaking of food, have you tried the new restaurant in Terminal B?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've heard good things about it. I might check it out tonight after work.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I might join you too, I heard they have really good steaks.<p class=message>Let's make it a dinner gathering with the other staff members too. It'll be a nice break from work.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I'll spread the word. Thanks for the idea.<p class=message>No problem. It's always good to have a little fun outside of work. Speaking of which, how was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was great, I visited my family in the countryside. How about yours?<p class=message>It was good. I watched a football game with some friends and caught up on some reading. Maybe we can do something together next weekend?<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds like a plan. We can plan something over lunch at the new coffee shop.<p class=message>Perfect, looking forward to it. Alright, Control Center B, I'll get back to work. Talk to you soon!<p class="message sent">Alright, have a good day, Control Tower A.
