How are you all doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning professor, I'm doing great today!<p class=message>That's good to hear. I hope everyone is ready for today's lesson on idiomatic expressions.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love learning about idioms. They're always so interesting.<p class=message>Yes, they are. So, let's get right into it. What's your favorite idiom, B?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'd have to say "break a leg." I think it's so funny that we say that for good luck.<p class=message>Yes, it is quite funny. Did you know that it originated in the theater world?<p class="message sent">No, I had no idea. That's really cool.<p class=message>Yes, actors used to say "break a leg" to each other as a way of wishing each other good luck before a performance.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. What about you, professor? What's your favorite idiom?<p class=message>Oh, there are so many to choose from. But I think I'll go with "bite the bullet." It means to face a difficult situation with courage and determination.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's a good one. I'll have to remember that.<p class=message>Alright, let's move on to some more idioms. How about "couch potato"?<p class="message sent">That's someone who just sits around and watches TV all day, right?<p class=message>Correct! And what about "piece of cake"?<p class="message sent">That means something is really easy to do, right?<p class=message>Yes, very good. I think you're going to do great on the quiz tomorrow!<p class="message sent">Thanks, professor. I'm excited to keep learning about idioms. They're so fun!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c0995dfd-2159-44b2-98fb-ff5cecb53019.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
