What can I get for you tonight?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I think I’d like to try your famous dumplings. Can you recommend a flavor for a first timer?<p class=message>Of course! Our pork and cabbage dumplings are a classic and always a crowd-pleaser. But if you’re feeling adventurous, our spicy beef dumplings are a must-try.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I’ll have to go with the classic then. And maybe a side of your homemade noodles to go with it?<p class=message>Great choice! Would you prefer them boiled or fried?<p class="message sent">Let’s go with boiled. And maybe some hot tea as well, to wash it all down.<p class=message>Excellent. I’ll go ahead and get that started for you. In the meantime, how’s business treating you today?<p class="message sent">Not too bad. We’ve had a few locals come in and try our ramen.<p class=message>That’s great to hear. We’re always happy to introduce new people to authentic Chinese cuisine.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, how did you get into making dumplings and noodles?<p class=message>Well, I come from a long line of dumpling makers back in China. My grandmother taught me the recipe and I’ve been perfecting it ever since. And you?<p class="message sent">My family has been in the noodle business for generations as well. I’ve been making them since I was a child!<p class=message>That’s amazing. It’s always great to meet fellow cooks who are passionate about their craft.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And it looks like our entrees are ready! These dumplings smell amazing.<p class=message>Thank you, I hope you enjoy them. And don’t hesitate to let me know if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, and I’ll make sure to spread the word about this little gem of a restaurant.<p class=message>That would mean the world to us. Thanks again for coming in today!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5bc023b0-f70e-4b61-9911-b1ef831196cf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
