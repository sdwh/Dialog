Not really, I'm just browsing. But maybe you can recommend some good books to me?<p class=message>Sure, what kind of books are you interested in?<p class="message sent">I teach science, so maybe something related to that. But also something light-hearted to read during my downtime.<p class=message>How about "The Martian" by Andy Weir? It's a science fiction novel that follows an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting! Do you have any other recommendations?<p class=message>For a lighter read, you might enjoy "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams. It's a comedic sci-fi book series that's quite popular.<p class="message sent">I've heard of that series before! I never got around to reading it, though. Thanks for suggesting it!<p class=message>No problem! We also have some non-fiction science books on display if you're interested.<p class="message sent">That sounds great, what do you recommend?<p class=message>"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" by Rebecca Skloot is a fascinating book about a woman whose cells were used in scientific research without her knowledge.<p class="message sent">Wow, I've actually heard of that book. It sounds like a really interesting read. Thanks for your help!<p class=message>You're welcome! Let me know if you need any further assistance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e5be3aec-8d0a-4cff-a904-a378cb05e7f9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
