How about you?<p class=message>I'm good. Let's get started with the audit. Do you have the server logs ready?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. But before we begin, can I ask you something?<p class=message>Sure, go ahead.<p class="message sent">How do you like your coffee? I just got a new coffee machine in the office.<p class=message>Oh, that's nice! I like my coffee black. How about you?<p class="message sent">I like mine with a little cream and sugar. Alright, let's get started with the audit. Here are the server logs.<p class=message>Great! I see that you have been taking regular backups of the server data.<p class="message sent">Yes, we take backups every day to ensure that we are always prepared in case of a system failure.<p class=message>That's good to hear. By the way, how did you celebrate when you first got this job?<p class="message sent">Oh, I remember cooking a big meal for my family and friends. It was a great feeling to finally get this job.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I love cooking as well. Do you have any recommendations for a good restaurant around here?<p class="message sent">Yes, there's a great Italian place a few blocks away. They make the most delicious pizza you'll ever have.<p class=message>That sounds like a great place. I'll definitely check it out sometime. Alright, let's continue with the audit.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Here's the list of all the software we are using on the server.<p class=message>Thank you. I see that you have installed all the required security updates as per the ISO 27001 guidelines.<p class="message sent">Yes, we keep our server up-to-date to ensure that we are always protected against any security threats.<p class=message>That's a great practice. It was really nice auditing with you today. Do you have any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I'm thinking of going on a hike. How about you?<p class=message>I'm planning to catch up on some reading and maybe go for a long walk in the park. Have a great weekend!<p class="message sent">You too, take care.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d66234da-0641-4edd-872b-0027386a1fa0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
