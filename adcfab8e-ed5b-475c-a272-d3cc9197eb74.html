I heard we're going to be implementing an automated deployment process for our software at the insurance company.<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing well. Yes, that's right. It's going to save us a lot of time and headache.<p class=message>Definitely! I'm looking forward to seeing it in action. What tools are we going to be using for it?<p class="message sent">We'll be using Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, and Docker for containerization. Have you used either of them before?<p class=message>I have some experience with Jenkins, but Docker is new to me. What can you tell me about it?<p class="message sent">Docker is a platform to develop, deploy, and run applications in containers. It's a powerful tool that can improve the efficiency and portability of our deployment process.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. I'll have to do some reading up on it. Do we need to make any changes to our code to make the deployment process smoother?<p class="message sent">We'll need to implement some automation scripts and set up a CI/CD pipeline, but other than that, the code should remain unchanged.<p class=message>Great, that shouldn't be too difficult. By the way, have you heard about that new insurance policy for insuring against UFO abductions?<p class="message sent">(laughs) No, I haven't. Is that for real?<p class=message>Apparently so. I think I might need to take out a policy just to be safe.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You never know when those aliens might decide to take you for a ride. But hey, at least our automated deployment process will be up and running smoothly by then.<p class=message>(laughs) That's true. Thanks for the chat, B. I'm looking forward to working on this project with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. Let's make it a success.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=adccbc43-8228-490a-9c5f-30dade49a972.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
