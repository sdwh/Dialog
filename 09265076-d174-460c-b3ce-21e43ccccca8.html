What brings you to Starbucks today?<p class="message sent">Hi! Just wanted to get out of the office for a bit. How about you?<p class=message>Same here! I'm actually here to meet a client, but they're running late.<p class="message sent">Ah, well, if you've got some free time, do you want to talk about work? I've been working on improving our website's search functionality.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting! I'm a web designer, so that's right up my alley. What are some of the issues you've been facing?<p class="message sent">Well, we've been getting a lot of complaints about the search bar not returning the right results. I've been thinking about using some AI to help refine searches.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Have you thought about adding filters as well? Like by category or price range?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm actually working on that right now. What do you think about adding a feature that suggests alternative search terms when the user doesn't get results?<p class=message>That's brilliant! It'll save them the frustration of having to repeatedly try different terms. Have you considered adding predictive text as well?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I'm also planning on adding a feature where users can see their recent search history.<p class=message>That's an excellent idea. I think that will personalize the experience and make it easier for users to find things they've searched for before.<p class="message sent">Exactly! It'll be like having a shopping list of everything you wanted to buy. Do you think there are any other features we should add?<p class=message>Hmm, how about a feature that shows related products when a user clicks on a specific product?<p class="message sent">Yes, I was thinking about that too! It'll help users explore products they might have missed.<p class=message>This all sounds fantastic. I can't wait to see the finished product. Hey, do you want to grab another coffee and keep brainstorming?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I might need that extra caffeine to keep going.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0920b1cb-28bf-4cc1-8047-5f6c08af9db2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
