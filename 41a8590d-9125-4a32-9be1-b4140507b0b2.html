I am glad to be working with you today.<p class="message sent">Hi! Nice to hear that. I feel excited to make some awesome sushi and rice balls.<p class=message>Yes, we should always bring our A-game when it comes to making Japanese cuisine. What do you recommend we start with?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think we should start with making some delicious rice. That is the foundation of any great sushi or rice ball.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I agree that perfectly cooked rice is essential to make any dish remarkable. Do you have any special techniques in making rice?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been taught by my mentor to wash the rice carefully and to use the right amount of water for the perfect consistency.<p class=message>Sounds like you have learned from the best. I have been taught to properly slice fish for sushi. Do you want me to show you some tricks?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm always ready to learn something new.<p class=message>Okay, so first you need to have fresh fish. Then, you cut it at an angle, not straight across, to make it easier to pick up.<p class="message sent">I see. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for teaching me!<p class=message>No problem! We're a team and we should share our knowledge. Have you tried making any unique sushi rolls?<p class="message sent">Yes, I once made a sushi roll with avocado and tempura shrimp. It was very popular with customers!<p class=message>That sounds delicious! I have also tried making a roll with cream cheese and crab meat. It was a hit too!<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds great! We should try making it together sometime.<p class=message>Sure, that sounds like a plan. I think we make a great team in the kitchen.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm happy to be working with you. Let's make some sushi and rice balls that our customers will love!<p class=message>Yes, let's give it our best shot!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=41a4cf7f-7eeb-4883-8d3e-4a519c22827c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
