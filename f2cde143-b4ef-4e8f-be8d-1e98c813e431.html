How's it going with the brewing process?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, A. We're working on a new South African-inspired beer today.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. What inspired the recipe?<p class="message sent">We wanted to showcase the unique flavor profiles of the region, using local ingredients like rooibos and honeybush.<p class=message>That's a great idea. How's the fermentation process coming along?<p class="message sent">It's slowly but surely doing its job. We're aiming for a medium-bodied beer with a smooth finish.<p class=message>The color looks amazing. What kind of hops did you use?<p class="message sent">We went for a combination of spicy and floral hops that complement the herbal notes of the tea.<p class=message>I'm looking forward to trying a sample later. Do you think this could be a new bestseller for us?<p class="message sent">It's definitely a possibility. South African flavors are becoming more popular, so we might be ahead of the curve.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have you tried any local food while you've been here in Cape Town?<p class="message sent">I've had some amazing biltong and peri-peri chicken. How about you?<p class=message>I went to a braai and had some delicious boerewors and chakalaka. It was a true South African feast!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great experience. I'm glad we can bring a little bit of that flavor into our beer.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's keep up the good work and see how it turns out. Cheers, B!<p class="message sent">Cheers, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f2ccf837-a653-4ead-a3ef-4037633b73c8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
