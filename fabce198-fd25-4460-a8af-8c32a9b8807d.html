It found a few vulnerabilities in our last release.<p class=message>Alright, can you elaborate on what you found and give me the details?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. We had a couple of instances of SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.<p class=message>Oh no, those can be serious issues. So, what’s the plan?<p class="message sent">Well, I’ve already created a branch to fix those issues. We just need to test it and make sure it doesn’t break anything else.<p class=message>Great work. I appreciate your prompt action on this. Did you find anything else interesting?<p class="message sent">Yeah, actually, our code has a really unique structure that the tool struggled to analyze.<p class=message>That’s pretty cool. We’re always trying to do things differently here. Maybe we should share our code with the developers of that tool.<p class="message sent">Definitely, it could help them improve their analysis capabilities.<p class=message>By the way, do you have any recommendations for other code analysis tools that we should try out?<p class="message sent">Well, I’ve used SonarQube before and found it pretty helpful.<p class=message>Thanks, I’ll look into it. By the way, have you seen the latest episode of Silicon Valley?<p class="message sent">Yes, it was hilarious! Did you catch the part where they made fun of our profession?<p class=message>Of course, but we have to admit, they weren’t too far off in their portrayal.<p class="message sent">Ha! I know, it’s funny because it’s true. Anyway, I’ve got to get back to fixing these vulnerabilities.<p class=message>Sounds good, keep up the great work B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fabb2fc2-634c-475d-8a92-6d33d8ae444a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
