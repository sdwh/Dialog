How's it going? I heard we are going to develop a new internal website system?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. Yes, we are. And you know what? We are going to use the latest jQuery and ASP.NET MVC 5 for it!<p class=message>Wow, that's great news! I've been using jQuery for years and I must say, it's really a lightweight and powerful tool.<p class="message sent">Yes, and with the new version, it has even more amazing features that we can incorporate into our project.<p class=message>That sounds exciting! And with ASP.NET MVC, we can easily integrate the front-end with our back-end logic, making development much more efficient.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Not to mention the amazing amount of customization we can do with ASP.NET and the security features it provides.<p class=message>Ah, you got me. Security is always a paramount concern for any website.<p class="message sent">That's right. We need to make sure our website is not only functional but also secure. Are you ready to dive into this project?<p class=message>Definitely! Let's get our hands dirty and create something amazing together.<p class="message sent">Awesome, that's what I like to hear. I'll start setting up the project in Visual Studio, you can start planning the front-end design.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Let's make this website a hit, and maybe even win an award or two!<p class="message sent">Haha, I like your enthusiasm. Let's get to work and see what we can come up with.<p class=message>Definitely, I can't wait! But first, coffee break?<p class="message sent">You read my mind. Let's grab a cup of coffee and get back to it in 10 minutes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=927a01ab-d332-4f23-a856-dc48df06636b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
