Have you ever heard of ISO 27001 Vulnerability Assessment?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have A. That's about identifying and addressing potential security weaknesses in an organization, right?<p class=message>Correct! You know your stuff. But have you ever done it yourself?<p class="message sent">Yes, I had a chance to do it in my previous job. It was quite challenging, but fulfilling.<p class=message>That's great! What did you like about it?<p class="message sent">I enjoyed being a detective for a day. Trying to find vulnerabilities and loopholes reminded me of those mystery game apps.<p class=message>Haha! I know what you mean. It's like we're solving a puzzle or playing a game.<p class="message sent">Yeah, exactly. And the best part is when you find a vulnerability, you could fix it before someone takes advantage of it.<p class=message>Absolutely! It's like being a superhero and saving the day.<p class="message sent">Speaking of superheroes, have you ever imagined ourselves as Batman and Robin, fighting the cybercriminals and protecting the organization?<p class=message>Ha-ha! That's funny. Although we might need some gadgets or tools to do so.<p class="message sent">True, but we already have our computers and software to conduct the assessment. It's like our own Batmobile and equipment.<p class=message>Wow, you're right! ISO 27001 Vulnerability Assessment is the perfect job for both detectives and superheroes.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Let's embrace our inner Batman and Robin and make our organization a safer place.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3f5d6583-c3aa-4aba-ad1e-46b793b8add7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
