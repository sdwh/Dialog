Are you checking in for the flight to Melbourne today?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. I'm excited for my trip.<p class=message>Great, have you got your passport and your boarding pass ready?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have them right here.<p class=message>Perfect, let me just weigh your luggage. Uh oh, it looks like your suitcase is overweight by a couple of kilos.<p class="message sent">Oh no! What should I do?<p class=message>Don't worry, you can either pay an excess baggage fee or you can try to redistribute some of the items to a carry-on bag.<p class="message sent">I think I'll take the latter option. Can I do that here?<p class=message>Sure, you can step to the side to take care of that while I process your check-in.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll quickly do that. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class=message>No problem at all. So, are you travelling alone today?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's just me.<p class=message>Is this your first time in Melbourne?<p class="message sent">No, I've been there before, but it's been a while so I'm looking forward to experiencing it again.<p class=message>That sounds nice. The weather is going to be fantastic over there.<p class="message sent">Really? That's great news!<p class=message>Yes, it's going to be sunny and warm. Have you planned any sightseeing or activities?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've got a few things in mind. I want to visit the Great Ocean Road and check out the cafes and restaurants in the city.<p class=message>You have a good list there. Alright, let me print out your luggage tags and finalize your check-in. You are all set to go!<p class="message sent">Thanks so much for your help. What gate should I head to?<p class=message>Your flight is departing from Gate C34. It's a short walk from here. And boarding will start in about 30 minutes.<p class="message sent">Excellent, I'll go ahead and make my way there. Thanks again!<p class=message>No worries, have a safe and pleasant journey.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=285429b4-78dd-42ca-8d5b-8f53ece8e936.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
