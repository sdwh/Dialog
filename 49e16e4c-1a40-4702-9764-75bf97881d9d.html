I'm the janitor. My name is Tim.<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you Tim. My name is Jane. So, what brings you to the staff room?<p class=message>Well, I was just taking a break, and it reminded me of something I wanted to bring up with you.<p class="message sent">Sure, what is it?<p class=message>I've noticed that some customers tend to litter, and it makes my job harder. Maybe we could put up some signs reminding people to dispose of their trash properly?<p class="message sent">That's a good point, Tim. It's important to keep the environment clean, not just for our own benefit but for the planet too.<p class=message>Yes, and I think it would be helpful to have a designated area for customers to put their trash in.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We can place bins at strategic locations around the store to make it easy for them.<p class=message>That's a great idea. Also, I've noticed that some of our employees tend to leave the break room in a mess. Would it be possible to remind them to clean after themselves?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, Tim. I'll make sure to have a meeting with the staff and emphasize the importance of keeping the staff room clean.<p class=message>Thank you so much, Jane. I really appreciate it.<p class="message sent">No problem, Tim. We're all in this together. Our goal is to provide the best experience for our customers while keeping our workplace clean and safe.<p class=message>You're right. And I'll make sure to do my part as well.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. It's always helpful when everyone takes responsibility for maintaining a clean environment.<p class=message>Definitely. I feel like we're on the same page, and I'm glad to work with someone who shares the same values.<p class="message sent">Likewise, Tim. It takes a team effort to make a positive impact.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=49dd3a9a-d4b8-417c-8d81-ab171be72a2e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
