How are you feeling today, B?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I’m feeling much better, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I’m doing well, thanks for asking. How was your night? Did you sleep well?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. The bed is very comfortable here.<p class=message>That’s great to hear. Have you had breakfast yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. The food here is surprisingly good!<p class=message>Yes, we have a great kitchen staff. Is there anything else you need this morning?<p class="message sent">Actually, do you think I could get some fresh air? I’ve been cooped up in here for a while.<p class=message>Absolutely! Let me help you up and we can take a little walk outside.<p class="message sent">Thank you, that sounds wonderful.<p class=message>So, tell me a little about yourself. What do you do for fun?<p class="message sent">Well, I love playing tennis and reading books. I also enjoy traveling.<p class=message>That sounds great! Have you been able to travel recently?<p class="message sent">Not since my injury, unfortunately. But I hope to plan a trip soon.<p class=message>That’s a great idea. Where do you think you might go?<p class="message sent">I’ve always wanted to go to Australia. What about you? Where’s your dream vacation spot?<p class=message>Oh, I’d love to go to Hawaii. I’ve never been to a tropical paradise like that.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Maybe we can plan a trip together when we’re both feeling better!<p class=message>That’s a deal! Alright, let’s head back inside. I’ll make sure you’re comfortable for the rest of the day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3f373407-3149-42d4-a895-396783a89696.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
