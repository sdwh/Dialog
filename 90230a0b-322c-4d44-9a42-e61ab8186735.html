My name is A and I'm a fisherman.<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm the tour guide here at the traditional fish market in Tsukiji. Welcome to our city!<p class=message>Thank you, I'm excited to explore and learn more about the local seafood.<p class="message sent">Great! Here we have an abundance of choices, from tuna to octopus and everything in between. What are you interested in buying today?<p class=message>Hmm, I'm thinking of getting some shrimp and crab. Can you show me the best places to find them?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. For shrimp, you'll want to look for ones with firm flesh and a bright color. If the shells are still on, check that they're not too dry or discolored.<p class=message>That's good to know. And how about crab?<p class="message sent">For crab, choose ones that feel heavy for their size and have a sweet, fresh scent. Look for ones with hard shells that are free of any cracks or holes.<p class=message>Thanks for the tips. It's always so helpful to have a guide to know what to look for.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. We're happy to share our knowledge and help visitors enjoy the best of what our market has to offer.<p class=message>Speaking of which, I can already see so many interesting types of seafood here. What's your personal favorite?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a tough one. I love uni (sea urchin) - it's such a delicacy and has a unique flavor that's hard to describe. Have you tried it before?<p class=message>Actually, I have! It's definitely an acquired taste but I can see why some people love it.<p class="message sent">That's great. I'm always impressed with how adventurous some visitors are with trying new foods.<p class=message>Well, if you're going to travel all the way to Japan, you might as well go all-in and try everything, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And if you have any questions or want to know more about a certain seafood, don't hesitate to ask. That's what we're here for.<p class=message>Thanks so much, I appreciate it. This has been a great experience so far.<p class="message sent">It's our pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your day here at Tsukiji market!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9021ddc4-b800-489f-a602-dbe082e6240a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
