How's it going?<p class="message sent">Great, thanks! How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too! Hey, did you hear about the ISO 27001 audit that's coming up?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did. It's always a bit nerve-wracking, isn't it?<p class=message>Yeah, definitely. But you know what they say, better safe than sorry!<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And it's a good chance to review our policies and procedures and make sure we're up to date.<p class=message>Yeah, I agree. It's like a self-checkup for the company!<p class="message sent">Haha, true. It's like we're our own doctors.<p class=message>Have you seen the auditor's checklist? It's like a mile long!<p class="message sent">Oh boy, that's going to be a lot of paperwork. But hey, we're no strangers to paperwork, right?<p class=message>Haha, right you are. And at least we'll have a lot of coffee breaks to look forward to.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, can't forget about those. Maybe we should stock up on some extra snacks too.<p class=message>Good idea! And maybe we can come up with some fun games to play during breaks.<p class="message sent">Hey, not a bad idea at all. Maybe we can turn this audit into a party!<p class=message>Haha, now you're talking. Who knew an audit could sound so exciting?<p class="message sent">It's all about perspective, my friend. Let's turn this into a positive experience and knock this audit out of the park!<p class=message>I'm with you, B. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=71bec49a-5d16-4f65-bf57-099bd3ccc13b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
