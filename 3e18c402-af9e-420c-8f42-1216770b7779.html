How many shrimp and fish would you like to purchase today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I'll take about 20 shrimps and 10 fish.<p class=message>Excellent choice! These are some of the freshest catches of the day. Are you planning to cook them yourself?<p class="message sent">No, I am actually opening up a restaurant featuring seafood. I heard this town is popular for its fresh fish, so I had to come check it out!<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear! What kind of restaurant are you planning on opening?<p class="message sent">It's going to be a special seafood restaurant with a focus on unique flavors and locally sourced ingredients.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! As a seasoned seasoning expert, I can recommend some spices and herbs that will elevate the flavors of your seafood dishes.<p class="message sent">That would be great! I want to incorporate some interesting and unexpected tastes into the dishes.<p class=message>Have you considered using a combination of chili flakes, garlic, and lime juice for your shrimp ceviche? It's a popular and refreshing dish.<p class="message sent">I haven't thought of that! That sounds delicious. And how about for the fish?<p class=message>For the fish, I recommend a blend of smoked paprika, cilantro, and lemon zest. It's a subtle yet flavorful combo.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to try these out! Thank you so much for your suggestions.<p class=message>No problem at all, I always enjoy sharing my love for seasoning. Best of luck with your restaurant!<p class="message sent">Thanks again.
