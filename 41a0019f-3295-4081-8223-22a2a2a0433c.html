I'm Pastry Chef A. Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm Chef B. It's great to work with you today.<p class=message>I see we're going to be baking lots of cakes and cookies. What's your favourite dessert to make?<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough one! I'd have to say chocolate fudge cake. It's always a crowd-pleaser.<p class=message>Oh, yum! I love chocolate too. But I'm more of a strawberry shortcake fan. Have you tried making that before?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have! I made it for my sister's birthday last year. She loved it.<p class=message>That's awesome! I'm sure it turned out great. So, what's your secret to making the perfect fudge cake?<p class="message sent">Well, my grandma taught me to always use real butter and pure cocoa powder. It makes a huge difference in the taste.<p class=message>Good tip! I'll keep that in mind. And for shortcakes, I like to use fresh berries and a bit of lemon zest for extra flavour.<p class="message sent">That sounds heavenly! I'll have to try your recipe sometime.<p class=message>Sure, I'll give it to you. And maybe you can teach me a recipe for one of your famous dishes.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! How about my homemade lasagna? It's been a family favourite for generations.<p class=message>Count me in! I can't wait to try it. This is going to be a fun day of baking and cooking together.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Let's get started on these chocolate fudge cakes first. Are you ready?<p class=message>Yes, I am! Let's do this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=419e412d-19ef-461d-ae8e-17fed1c4119a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
