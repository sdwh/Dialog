What's the concept?<p class="message sent">Hey, happy to work with you too. Well, we're still brainstorming, but we're thinking of a game where you play as a ninja who has to navigate through a maze.<p class=message>Oh cool, that sounds like a lot of fun! Will there be any special moves or weapons?<p class="message sent">Yes, we're thinking of adding some cool ninja gadgets like smoke bombs and grappling hooks to help you get through the maze.<p class=message>Nice, I'm already hyped for this game. What's the target age group?<p class="message sent">We're aiming for teenagers and young adults who love adventure games and challenges.<p class=message>Well count me in, even though I'm not that young anymore. But hey, age is just a number, right?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Absolutely! And besides, gaming is for everyone. I'm still addicted to the classics like Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog.<p class=message>Oh wow, those are some classic games indeed. What about new games? Have you played any other mobile games recently that you loved?<p class="message sent">Yes, I really enjoyed playing Among Us actually. It's such a fun game to play with friends and family.<p class=message>Among Us is amazing! It's such a simple concept but so addictive. Do you think we can add any elements of that game to this new game that we're developing?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, we can add some elements like teamwork and communication to help players navigate through the maze.<p class=message>Perfect, teamwork makes the dream work. Alright, so what's next on the to-do list for this game?<p class="message sent">Well, we need to work on the storyline, level design, and character development. Plus, we need to add some cool sound effects and music to bring the game to life.<p class=message>Sounds good! When can we expect a beta version of the game?<p class="message sent">We're aiming to launch the beta version in about 3 months. But we'll keep you updated as we progress.<p class=message>Awesome, looking forward to it. Thanks for the chat, it's been great!<p class="message sent">No problem, it was really nice talking to you too. Let's crush this game development together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e7ad05c5-3899-4618-b7ae-2bfc6bb7f2e4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
