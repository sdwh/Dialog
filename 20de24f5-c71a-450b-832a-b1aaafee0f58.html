How's business today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It's been steady so far. How about you?<p class=message>Not bad. I'm trying to figure out how to sell more of my fresh fruits.<p class="message sent">Well, you could try offering samples to customers. People love free stuff.<p class=message>That's a great idea! I'll have to bring some samples next time.<p class="message sent">Another thing that works for me is packaging - people are more likely to buy if it's already put together in a convenient way.<p class=message>Hmm, I see what you mean. What kind of packaging do you use?<p class="message sent">I put together small baskets or bags of assorted fruits, or sometimes I make fruit kebabs. It's all about convenience and appeal.<p class=message>That's really helpful, thanks for the tips! I'll have to give it a try.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. And I have to say, your fruits always look so fresh and healthy.<p class=message>Thank you! That means a lot coming from you. Your display always looks so inviting.<p class="message sent">Thank you as well. It's all about presentation, right?<p class=message>Definitely. It's amazing how much difference it can make.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Well, good luck with your sales, and let me know how the samples and packaging work out.<p class=message>I will, thanks again!
