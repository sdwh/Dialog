Are we ready to serve up some delicious dessert and dim sum to our Chinatown customers?<p class="message sent">I'm good, A! I've got all the ingredients we need for our signature egg tarts and silky tofu pudding. How about you?<p class=message>I'm feeling great, B! The kitchen is prepped and ready to churn out our famous char siu bao and Har Gow dumplings. I can't wait for our customers to taste them.<p class="message sent">Me too, A! Speaking of which, have you tried our new mango sago dessert yet? It's been a hit with our regulars.<p class=message>Oh yeah, I tried it yesterday and it was amazing! I think we should add it to our menu permanently.<p class="message sent">Agreed! It's a must-try for anyone who loves creamy and fruity sweets. By the way, do you need any help in the kitchen today?<p class=message>Actually, I do. Can you help me fold some wontons for our soup?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A! I'm an expert in wonton-making, after all. Do you want to hear a joke while we fold?<p class=message>Of course! I love a good joke. What's the difference between a poorly dressed man on a trampoline and a well-dressed man on a trampoline?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I don't know. What's the punchline?<p class=message>Attire! (a tire) Get it?<p class="message sent">Ha ha ha, that's a good one, A! You always crack me up.<p class=message>Thanks, B! I like to keep things lighthearted and fun around here. Okay, I think we've folded enough wontons for now. Let's pop them in the soup and get ready for the lunch rush.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, A! Let's show Chinatown what authentic Hong Kong-style dim sum and desserts are all about.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f15c91e7-a58f-4dc2-b10f-1a3e2d9b7bd3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
