Maybe to some people, but we do much more than that."<p class=message>"I know, I know. But sometimes I feel like we spend half our shift helping old ladies cross the street."<p class="message sent">"That's true, but it's all part of keeping the community safe and connected."<p class=message>"Yeah, yeah. Speaking of which, did you hear that Sarah got her cat stuck in a tree again?"<p class="message sent">"Ha! Not surprised. I swear that cat has a grudge against her."<p class=message>"We should make a bet on how many times we'll have to rescue that cat this year."<p class="message sent">"I'm in. Last year it was three times, so my money is on four times this year."<p class=message>"I'll take the under on that one. I bet we'll only have to rescue him twice this year."<p class="message sent">"Alright, you're on. Winner gets a free coffee from the vending machine."<p class=message>"Deal. And hey, we should head over to that new donut shop on Main Street during our break. I heard they have some killer donuts."<p class="message sent">"Yes! Nothing like patrolling on a sugar high."<p class=message>"Exactly. It keeps us on our toes."<p class="message sent">"Hey, did you hear about that legendary cop who once solved a crime while eating a donut?"<p class=message>"No way!
