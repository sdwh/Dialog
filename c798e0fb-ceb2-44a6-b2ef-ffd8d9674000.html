We're supposed to use Bootstrap and ASP.NET MVC 5.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I saw that. I'm actually excited to work with Bootstrap. It's a great framework for front-end development.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I was a little nervous about having to learn it on the fly.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I can help you out. I've used Bootstrap before, and it's pretty user-friendly.<p class=message>Thanks, that's a relief. And what about ASP.NET MVC 5? Have you worked with that before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's a powerful framework for back-end development. It's great for building complex applications.<p class=message>Cool, I'm looking forward to getting started on this project. Do you have any ideas for the design?<p class="message sent">How about we go for a modern and minimalistic look using a monochromatic color scheme?<p class=message>I like that idea. We should also make sure the site is responsive and mobile-friendly.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, that's a must these days. It'll be challenging but fun to develop this project from scratch.<p class=message>I agree. It's always exciting to tackle a new project and learn new skills. Let's make sure to communicate and collaborate well throughout the development process.<p class="message sent">Agreed. With great teamwork, we can make this project a success.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c7974421-872f-4a1e-b92b-e5663822b831.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
