How's the backend development going?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. The backend is coming along nicely. How about you? How's the database management going?<p class=message>It's going great. I've been organizing all the data we've collected so far and making it easy to access. I'm excited to see it all come together on the website.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's always exciting to see the end product after all the hard work. Have you thought about any cool features we could add to the website?<p class=message>Definitely. I was thinking of adding a map feature that allows users to see where certain species of marine life are located around the world.<p class="message sent">That's an awesome idea. It would be a great tool for researchers.<p class=message>Yeah, and it would also be cool to have a section that highlights different organizations and projects that are working to protect and conserve the ocean.<p class="message sent">I like that idea. It's important to raise awareness and encourage people to take action.<p class=message>Definitely. Hey, have you heard about that giant octopus that was recently discovered in the deep sea?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I saw that on the news. It's amazing what kind of creatures exist in the ocean that we haven't even discovered yet.<p class=message>It really is. That's why it's so important to keep collecting data and studying the ocean.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I'm glad we're working on this project together because it's such an important issue.<p class=message>Same here. It's great to work with someone who is just as passionate about marine life and conservation.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=823f7c81-526c-4f68-82fb-970bc1845114.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
