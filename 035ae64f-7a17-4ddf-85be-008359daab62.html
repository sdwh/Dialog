One effective strategy is to use influencer marketing. Do you know what that is?<p class="message sent message-content">Not really, can you explain?<p class="message received message-content">Sure! It's when you partner with popular bloggers or social media users to promote your product or service to their followers. It can be a great way to reach a new audience.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, that's interesting! Do you have any recommendations for influencers to work with?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, I actually have a list of local influencers who might be a good fit for your brand. Let me send it to you.<p class="message sent message-content">That would be amazing, thank you!<p class="message received message-content">No problem!
