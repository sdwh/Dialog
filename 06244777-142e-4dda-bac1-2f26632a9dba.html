Any ideas?<p class="message received message-content">Hmm, did you try optimizing the indexes on the tables?<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, I already did that. Maybe we need to take a closer look at the WHERE clauses in our queries.<p class="message received message-content">Good point. Have you heard of the new feature in SQL Server 2019 that uses machine learning to optimize queries?<p class="message sent message-content">No, I haven't. That sounds pretty cool. Do you think it could help us out?<p class="message received message-content">It's definitely worth a shot. Let's give it a try and see if our queries start running faster.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds like a plan. By the way, have you tried the new Indian restaurant that just opened up down the street?<p class="message received message-content">Not yet, but I've heard good things about it. Want to go there for lunch and recharge before we dive back into our project?<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely! I could use some delicious curry to give me energy for the afternoon.<p class="message received message-content">Great, let's finish up this query and head out. I'll grab my jacket.<p class="message sent message-content">You got it. I'll finish up this last line of code and meet you outside.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=061549a6-ca62-4be6-9335-68aa5083b1db.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
