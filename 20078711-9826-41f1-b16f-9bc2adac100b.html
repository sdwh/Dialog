How's it going today?<p class="message sent">Not bad, thanks for asking. Just trying to get all of these pastries baked before the lunch rush.<p class=message>I know the feeling. The smell of fresh bread and croissants is enough to make anyone hungry.<p class="message sent">Speaking of croissants, have you tried the pain au chocolat we made this morning? It's to die for.<p class=message>I did, and you're right. It's amazing. You really know your way around a pastry kitchen.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Chef. I learned from the best.<p class=message>Oh, stop it, you're making me blush. But seriously, the baguettes you made yesterday were perfection.<p class="message sent">Well, I have a few tricks up my sleeve. Let's just say I know how to handle yeast.<p class=message>Ah, the secret weapon of bakers everywhere. Speaking of which, can I borrow some yeast for my sourdough bread recipe?<p class="message sent">Of course, you can. But it's a trade. I'll give you the yeast but you have to let me taste your sourdough bread.<p class=message>Deal. I'll make a fresh batch tomorrow for you to try.<p class="message sent">Awesome. By the way, I heard you're working on a new sandwich recipe for our menu. What's in it?<p class=message>It's a grilled cheese with three types of cheese- gouda, cheddar, and brie. Plus, a basil and tomato spread to give it that extra oomph.<p class="message sent">Mmm, my mouth is watering already. You're a genius, Chef.<p class=message>*laughs* Well, I do my best. Hey, after work, you want to grab a coffee and discuss our next baking adventure?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Until then, let's get back to work and make these customers' taste buds dance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=20076781-f71b-407a-8baf-7fd357d663be.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
