The steam and ash may look scary, but it's actually a breathtaking spectacle.<p class="message sent">I agree. I can't take my eyes off of it.

In fact, there was a small eruption just last week.<p class="message sent">Wow, that must have been amazing to witness.<p class=message>Yes, it was quite a sight! You should definitely stay for the evening when the crater glows. It's an unforgettable experience.<p class="message sent">I will definitely do that.
