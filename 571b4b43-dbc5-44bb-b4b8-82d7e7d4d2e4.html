Did I get it right?<p class="message sent">Yes, you did, Dad. You never forget what I like.<p class=message>That's because you are my little princess. Do you wanna play some frisbee after we eat?<p class="message sent">Sure, but you know you are gonna lose, right?<p class=message>Ha-ha, we'll see about that. By the way, did you finish reading that book I got you?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. And I already picked out another one I wanna read.<p class=message>That's great. You really love to read, don't you?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes, I do. It's like escaping into a world of fantasy and adventure.<p class=message>I know what you mean. I used to love reading when I was your age too.<p class="message sent">Really? What kind of books did you read?<p class=message>Well, mostly sci-fi and mystery. Hey, speaking of mysteries, have you heard about that missing cat in our neighborhood?<p class="message sent">No, what cat?<p class=message>Apparently, some lady's cat went missing a few days ago. People are saying it was abducted by aliens.<p class="message sent">Ha-ha, seriously Dad? Aliens?<p class=message>Well, you never know. Maybe they thought the cat was an earthling and decided to take it home with them.<p class="message sent">Dad, you crack me up sometimes.<p class=message>I'm just trying to keep things interesting. Now, how about we eat before the ants take over our food?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=57137f84-21a2-46df-98a2-3d8f99f16035.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
