I'm always happy to help a fellow seafood enthusiast. What kind of seafood are you looking for?<p class=message>I'm interested in getting some lobster and crab, but everything else is fair game too.<p class="message sent">Well, the best place to start would be at the local fish market. They usually have a good selection of fresh seafood that is caught daily.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I've been to a few markets around here, but I haven't found anything that really stood out.<p class="message sent">Have you tried talking to the fishermen directly? They might have some recommendations and they could even tell you where they're catching their catch of the day!<p class=message>I haven't, but that's a great idea! It would be interesting to hear about their experiences out on the sea.<p class="message sent">You could also check out some of the local restaurants that specialize in seafood. They typically have access to the freshest seafood and they might be able to point you in the right direction.<p class=message>That's true. I should definitely give that a try as well. Thanks for the tips, Chef B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. And when you do find some good seafood, be sure to come back and tell me all about it. I'm always looking for new ingredients to work with.<p class=message>Will do! It's been great chatting with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. Don't forget to wear your wetsuit next time you come by!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d15b9bdf-bad6-4e81-a633-b9a2359ee884.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
