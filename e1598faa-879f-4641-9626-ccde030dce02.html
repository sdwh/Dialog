It's the perfect pick-me-up for this chilly weather.<p class=message>That sounds tempting. I'll definitely have to try it. So how long have you been a barista?<p class="message sent">I've been a barista for about four years now. It's been fun working with different coffee beans and perfecting latte art.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. I'm still learning the art of baking, but I love experimenting with new flavors and textures.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! I love trying different types of bread too. Do you have any recommendations for me to try?<p class=message>Our cinnamon raisin bread is a fan favorite, and the croissants are baked fresh every morning.<p class="message sent">Oh, I can smell the croissants right now. They smell heavenly!<p class=message>Thank you, we take pride in our baking.
