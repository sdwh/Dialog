Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm B, an engineer from an ocean energy company. It's great to meet you too.<p class=message>So, what brings you to our humble fishing port today?<p class="message sent">Well, our company is planning to build an ocean energy project nearby, and we wanted to discuss how it might impact the fishing industry here.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Well, we definitely don't want any negative effects on our livelihoods as fishermen.<p class="message sent">Definitely not. That's why we're committed to finding solutions to mitigate any potential impacts.<p class=message>That's really good to hear. Can you tell me how you plan to do that?<p class="message sent">Sure. We're exploring technologies like subsea power cables that wouldn't interfere with fishing activities, and working with local communities to identify any areas of concern.<p class=message>Well, that sounds promising. As long as you're willing to work with us and listen to our concerns, we can definitely find a way to coexist.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We want to be good neighbors and contribute positively to the local economy.<p class=message>That's music to my ears. Can I ask you a personal question?<p class="message sent">Of course.<p class=message>As an engineer, have you ever tried your hand at fishing?<p class="message sent">(laughs) I have to admit, I haven't. But maybe you can show me the ropes sometime!<p class=message>You got it. I'll teach you how to catch the big one.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Thanks for being so welcoming and open-minded.<p class=message>No problem. We all need to work together to protect the ocean and the jobs it provides.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I look forward to partnering with you for the good of the community.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5d541c88-9db6-45e3-b485-83cdb5f394fb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
