How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! I'm doing pretty well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. Listen, I think we need to talk about our network security. It's a little outdated.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. I've been doing some research on the latest and greatest security measures.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What have you found?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, we need to update our firewalls. They're not as effective as they once were.<p class=message>That's definitely something we need to address. What about encryption?<p class="message sent">Encryption is a big one. We need to make sure that our sensitive data is protected properly.<p class=message>Agreed. We should probably also make sure that our employees are aware of basic security protocols.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. A lot of breaches happen because people aren't aware of the risks.<p class=message>Speaking of risks, have you seen any suspicious activity on the network lately?<p class="message sent">Not recently, but that doesn't mean it's not happening. That's why it's important to have a good intrusion detection system.<p class=message>Good point. And what about email security?<p class="message sent">We need to use stronger passwords and enable two-factor authentication. Phishing attacks are becoming more and more sophisticated.<p class=message>Sounds like there's a lot to do, but it's important that we get started. Thanks for your input, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Let's make sure we keep our network safe and secure!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e26ef217-6dfb-42e3-a99b-fc5e539164a4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
