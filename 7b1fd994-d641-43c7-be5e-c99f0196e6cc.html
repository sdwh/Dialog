Can you tell me more about them?<p class="message sent">Of course! We have some classic dishes like Yorkshire pudding, fish and chips, Shepherd's pie, and Cornish pasty.<p class=message>Wow, those sound amazing! What's Yorkshire pudding like?<p class="message sent">It's a savory dish made with batter and usually served with beef and gravy. It's a must-try!<p class=message>Yum! And how about fish and chips?<p class="message sent">It's a staple in British cuisine. It's deep-fried battered fish with thick-cut chips. A perfect comfort food!<p class=message>That sounds delicious! And what is a Shepherd's pie?<p class="message sent">It's a casserole dish made with lamb or beef mince and mashed potatoes on top. It's warm and hearty, perfect for a chilly evening.<p class=message>Mmm, I can't wait to try that too! Tell me about Cornish pasty.<p class="message sent">It's a pastry filled with beef, potatoes, onions, and swede (a type of turnip). It's a savory handheld meal, perfect for a quick and filling snack.<p class=message>You've convinced me, I want to order all of them! Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely try the Yorkshire pudding with our slow-cooked beef brisket. And our fish and chips are hand-battered and completely fresh every day.<p class=message>I'll take your word for it, thanks for the recommendations!<p class="message sent">No problem, enjoy your meal! And if you have any questions, feel free to ask.<p class=message>Will do, thanks again! I'm excited to try all of these classic British dishes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7b1d4af6-a64f-4d77-ad3b-a7bd131c7b25.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
