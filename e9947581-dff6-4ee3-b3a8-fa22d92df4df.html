I heard that we're on a quest to find some missing villagers.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's right. I'm glad to have you as my partner for this mission.<p class=message>I'm a skilled archer, so I'm confident we'll find them soon enough.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic! I'm a close-combat fighter myself, so we make a good team.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have you checked the nearby forest yet? It's a common hiding spot for bandits.<p class="message sent">Not yet, but let's head there right away. I'll lead the way since I have my trusty sword.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. And if we come across any enemies, you'll take care of them up close while I cover from afar.<p class="message sent">That's a good strategy. We'll make quick work of them.<p class=message>But let's not forget to be careful too. We don't want to get caught off guard.<p class="message sent">Of course. Safety first. We'll make sure to keep our eyes peeled and our senses sharp.<p class=message>I agree. Oh, by the way, have you heard about the oracle who's said to live in the nearby mountains?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's the story about that?<p class=message>Some say that the oracle can predict the future and help people find what they're looking for. Maybe we can seek their guidance if we need it.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. We might as well visit them if we get the chance. Who knows, they might have some helpful insights for our mission.<p class=message>That's a good idea. Let's keep that in mind. But for now, let's focus on finding those missing villagers.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We can't let them stay lost for much longer. Let's get moving!<p class=message>That's the spirit! Let's do this, warrior!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e98a4397-e91f-438f-a292-dc977d275abd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
