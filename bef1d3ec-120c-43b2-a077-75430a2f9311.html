Our chai lattes are a customer favorite. It's the perfect blend of spices and sweetness.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll have to give it a try next time. By the way, this muffin is amazing.

I might have to take a few pastries to-go.<p class=message>No problem at all. We always have a fresh batch of pastries waiting for our customers. Do you need any packaging for your to-go order?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. And also, may I ask for a business card?
