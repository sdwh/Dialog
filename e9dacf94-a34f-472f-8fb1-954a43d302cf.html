Do you have any recommendations on which licenses to get?<p class="message sent">Yes, we need to be careful with licensing to avoid any compliance issues. Based on our requirements, I suggest getting the standard edition.<p class=message>Sounds good. Will we need to also buy CALs?<p class="message sent">Yes, we will need to purchase CALs for every user or device that accesses the SQL Server.<p class=message>That's helpful to know. Could we use a virtual machine environment to save costs?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, we can use virtualization to save on hardware costs and still obtain the performance and scalability we need.<p class=message>Great idea. Since we will be storing sensitive data, how can we ensure the security of our SQL Server?<p class="message sent">We can use encryption, access controls, and regular patching to ensure the security of our SQL Server.<p class=message>That makes sense. Can we also use SQL Server for data analytics purposes?<p class="message sent">Yes, the SQL Server includes many tools for data analytics such as reporting services, analysis services, and integration services.<p class=message>Wow, I didn't know that. Can we use SQL Server on cloud platforms?<p class="message sent">Yes, SQL Server is available on cloud platforms like Azure and AWS. We can choose the option that best suits our needs.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Thanks for all your help B, it was good to learn more about SQL Server licensing and options.<p class="message sent">Anytime A, it's always good to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and licensing requirements.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e9da787d-89b8-43c0-af3f-051d6310f4e3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
