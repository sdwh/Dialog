How long do you think it will take us to get to Beijing?<p class="message sent">Good morning, ma'am. It usually takes around 3 hours, depending on traffic.<p class=message>That's not too bad. Have you been a taxi driver for long?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been driving taxis for more than 10 years now. What about you, where are you from?<p class=message>I'm from Taiwan. This is my first time visiting Beijing actually.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's great. Beijing has a lot to offer, you should definitely try the roast duck here.<p class=message>I heard about that! I can't wait to try it. What does Beijing mean to you?<p class="message sent">To me, Beijing is a city full of history and culture. It's also a place where you can see the contrast of old and new.<p class=message>That's so interesting. What are some of your favorite places to visit here?<p class="message sent">Personally, I like the Summer Palace and the Forbidden City. They are both so beautiful and have so much history.<p class=message>I'm excited to see those places too. Do you have any recommendations for good souvenirs to bring back home?<p class="message sent">You can try buying some traditional Chinese crafts like silk, porcelain or jade. They are all very unique and represent Chinese culture.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for your help, driver.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, ma'am. Enjoy your trip in Beijing!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d0ff1ce3-a21b-48b7-a44f-ad2169f26105.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
