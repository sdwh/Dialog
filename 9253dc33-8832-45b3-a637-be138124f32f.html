It's really interesting to see how the system is shaping up.<p class=message>Definitely! We're using Razor Pages for its simplicity and ease of use compared to other frameworks.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's great for quickly and easily building web pages with server-side programming.<p class=message>And the flexibility of Razor Pages allows for greater control over the HTML, making our website design much more efficient.<p class="message sent">That's true. Plus, Razor Pages allows for smooth integration with other ASP.NET technologies that we might need in the future.<p class=message>Exactly! It's a great choice for future-proofing our website.<p class="message sent">Have you encountered any challenges while using Razor Pages?<p class=message>Not really. It's fairly straightforward to use and the documentation is quite comprehensive.<p class="message sent">Awesome. I'm looking forward to seeing what the team creates with this technology.<p class=message>Me too! It's always exciting to work on new projects and experiment with new frameworks.<p class="message sent">And with the development of this website, we'll be able to increase productivity and streamline communication within the company.<p class=message>Definitely. Plus, it's going to make our website much more user-friendly, which is always a major goal for us.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. So, when's the release date for the new website?<p class=message>We're shooting for next month, but you know how these things go. Fingers crossed!<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah, let's hope for the best. Thanks for discussing this with me, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Looking forward to collaborating on this project with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=92503e6b-e773-4d9c-a547-379746a84e6b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
