What are you up to today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Mom! I was thinking about doing some baking. Do you want to help me?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds like fun! What do you want to make?<p class="message sent">I was thinking about making some cupcakes. We can decorate them with frosting and sprinkles.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. Do we have all the ingredients we need?<p class="message sent">I think so. We have flour, sugar, eggs, butter, and baking powder. We just need some milk and vanilla extract.<p class=message>Okay, I'll go grab those from the store. You start measuring out the dry ingredients.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, Mom. Do you want to listen to some music while we bake?<p class=message>Sure, what do you want to listen to?<p class="message sent">How about some Taylor Swift? She always puts me in a good mood.<p class=message>Sounds perfect. Let's get this baking party started!<p class="message sent">Okay, I just measured out the flour and sugar. Can you help me crack the eggs?<p class=message>Of course. Do you want to mix the dry and wet ingredients together?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. Do we need to add anything else to the batter?<p class=message>Just the milk and vanilla extract, which I have right here.<p class="message sent">Yum, this batter looks so delicious. I can't wait to lick the spoon!<p class=message>Haha, me too. Let's go ahead and fill up the muffin tin and put it in the oven.<p class="message sent">How long do they need to bake for?<p class=message>About 18-20 minutes. While we wait, we can start making the frosting.<p class="message sent">I love frosting! What flavor are we making?<p class=message>How about vanilla? It will go perfectly with the cupcakes.<p class="message sent">Sounds great. Can I use the electric mixer to make it?<p class=message>Sure, just be careful not to get it all over the kitchen.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, Mom. I've got this!<p class=message>Alright, the timer just went off. Let's take the cupcakes out of the oven and let them cool before we frost them.<p class="message sent">They look so cute and fluffy! I can't wait to decorate them.<p class=message>Me too, B. This was a fun morning of baking together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1d9e5df1-eea0-45e2-9403-4548b0083612.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
