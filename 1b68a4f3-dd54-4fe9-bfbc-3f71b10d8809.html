How's the grape harvest going this year?<p class="message sent">Hi A, it's going pretty well actually. The weather has been favorable, and we're expecting a good yield.<p class=message>That's great to hear! I can't wait to see how it turns out. Speaking of which, what dishes are you thinking of pairing with your champagne this year?<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking of trying out some lobster bisque with our Grand Cru. I think it'll bring out the savory notes in the champagne.<p class=message>Ooh, that sounds like a great choice. And for the Blanc de Blancs, I was planning on serving some seared tuna with a citrus glaze.<p class="message sent">Delicious. I could also recommend trying out some sushi or sashimi with that one, so the flavors won't overpower each other.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Maybe we could do a special sushi night at the restaurant. Speaking of which, did you hear about the new pastry chef we hired?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What kind of desserts are they making?<p class=message>They specialize in macarons, so we'll have to come up with a champagne pairing for those as well. Maybe a Blanc de Noirs with a chocolate or coffee-based macaron?<p class="message sent">That could be interesting. I'm actually doing a tasting of some new blends next week, so I'll let you know if I find any that would be a good match.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. We'll definitely have to collaborate on a wine dinner event soon too.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's always a pleasure to work with you, A. Your dishes really highlight the flavors of our champagne.<p class=message>Thank you, B. And likewise, your champagne really elevates the dining experience at our restaurant. Cheers to another successful year of collaboration!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1b65cd6a-5dc4-4b18-adb0-cb4b322feb00.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
