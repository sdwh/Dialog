I'm the real estate agent, A. How can I help you?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I'm interested in purchasing a home here on the Gold Coast.<p class=message>Wonderful! What kind of property are you looking for?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm hoping for a place with a good amount of natural light and a nice backyard.<p class=message>Those are great features to look for. What's your budget like?<p class="message sent">I'm willing to spend up to $600,000.<p class=message>That's definitely doable! We've got some great options in that price range. Have you considered a beachside property?<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! But I'm a bit concerned about the upkeep.<p class=message>Not to worry! We can find properties with low-maintenance gardens or even options with strata fees to take care of it for you.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Do any properties come to mind?<p class=message>Yes, I've got a few listings in mind. But first let's grab a coffee and we can discuss further.<p class="message sent">Perfect! I'm up for a caffeine fix.<p class=message>Great! There's a lovely café down the street that serves amazing coffee.<p class="message sent">Perfect, that sounds great. So, A, do you have any crazy stories from your years of being a real estate agent?<p class=message>Oh, I've got plenty! I once had a buyer who only cared about the color of the tiles in the bathroom.<p class="message sent">Was the color that important to them?<p class=message>Apparently so! In the end, we found the perfect house with the perfect tiles for their taste.<p class="message sent">I guess everyone has their own preferences when it comes to homes.<p class=message>Exactly! It's my job to find the perfect match for each client.<p class="message sent">I'm really glad I found you then. I feel like I'm in good hands.<p class=message>It's a pleasure to have you as a client, B. Let's head over to the café and find your dream home!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9af7ad7e-e800-4cad-b063-30ece38f25ea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
