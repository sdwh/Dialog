What time does it depart?<p class="message sent">The flight departs at 10:00 am, but be sure to arrive at least two hours beforehand to check-in and go through security.<p class=message>Got it. And what about baggage allowance?<p class="message sent">You're allowed one free carry-on bag and one personal item. If you have any checked bags, additional fees may apply.<p class=message>Okay, thanks for letting me know. Can you recommend a good place to grab a bite to eat before my flight?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! There are a few great cafes and restaurants in the terminal, depending on what you're in the mood for. I highly recommend the sushi place in the international terminal.<p class=message>Mmm, sounds delicious. I'll have to check it out. Also, is there any in-flight entertainment or WiFi available?<p class="message sent">Yes, there are a variety of movies, TV shows, and music available on the seatback screens. There's also a fee-based WiFi service available for those who want to stay connected during the flight.<p class=message>Great, I'll make sure to bring my headphones. And one final question â€“ should I print my boarding pass or can I just show it on my phone?<p class="message sent">You can actually show your boarding pass on your phone, no need to print it. Just make sure your phone is fully charged to avoid any issues.<p class=message>Perfect, that makes things easier. Thanks so much for your help, you've been a great assistant!<p class="message sent">Anytime! Have a safe and enjoyable flight to Honolulu.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b37293f1-b5ce-492b-bc61-8e4f713812a0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
