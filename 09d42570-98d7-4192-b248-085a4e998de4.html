Nice to meet you. What brings you to the port today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I’m the owner of the seafood restaurant down the road. I’m here to talk about seafood sourcing.<p class=message>Oh, great! As a fisherman, I can tell you all about the fresh catch of the day. What kind of seafood are you looking for?<p class="message sent">Well, we always need different types of fish and shellfish. Can you give me some recommendations?<p class=message>Sure thing! Today we have some really nice flounder, monkfish, and squid. We also have a good supply of clams, mussels, and shrimp.<p class="message sent">Sounds awesome! I bet our customers would love those. Do you have any special requests from us?<p class=message>Actually, we’ve been looking into trying out some new types of seafood lately. Have you heard of sunfish or scup?<p class="message sent">Sunfish? Hmm, not really. What’s it like?<p class=message>It’s a round, flat fish with a tough texture. Some people say it tastes like chicken, while others say it’s quite bland. But if you cook it right, it can be very delicious!<p class="message sent">Interesting! I might have to give that a try. Do you have any tips on how to cook it?<p class=message>Well, a popular way to prepare it is to bread and fry it. But I’ve also seen it grilled or baked as well. Just make sure to season it well with herbs and spices!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Speaking of cooking, what are some popular dishes that people order from your restaurant?<p class=message>Our customers love our seafood paella, lobster bisque, and garlic butter shrimp. We also have a great selection of sushi rolls!<p class="message sent">Yum, my mouth is watering already! I definitely want to add some of those to our menu. Thanks for all your help today, you’ve given me lots of great ideas.<p class=message>No problem, always happy to help out a fellow seafood lover!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=09d3e931-b351-4f5a-aaaf-32fc09064a22.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
