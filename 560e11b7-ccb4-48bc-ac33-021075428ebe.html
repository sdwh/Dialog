How are you enjoying your stay in Kyoto so far, B?<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me. I'm loving it here. The city's history and culture are truly fascinating.<p class=message>I completely agree. Speaking of culture, have you ever experienced a traditional Japanese tea ceremony or tried our local cuisine?<p class="message sent">Yes, as a matter of fact, I've been studying and practicing tea ceremony for a few years now. And I can't wait to try some authentic Japanese dishes.<p class=message>That's wonderful! We have a special set menu that includes a variety of local specialties. Is there anything you'd like to try in particular?<p class="message sent">Hmm, everything looks so good. How about you recommend me your personal favorite?<p class=message>Sure thing, I highly recommend our grilled miso-marinated black cod. It's a popular dish among both locals and tourists.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! And what about tea? Can you recommend me a specific one to try with the meal?<p class=message>Of course, I'd suggest trying our matcha green tea. It pairs well with the rich and savory flavors of the black cod.<p class="message sent">Fantastic! I'm looking forward to it. By the way, how long does a traditional tea ceremony typically last?<p class=message>It can vary from 30 minutes to a few hours, depending on the type of ceremony and the occasion. But don't worry, we'll keep it to a reasonable time since you're a guest.<p class="message sent">I appreciate that. I don't think my legs could endure sitting in seiza for hours.<p class=message>Haha, I understand. Well, the tea ceremony is all about experiencing the beauty and tranquility of Japanese culture, so I hope you'll enjoy it.<p class="message sent">I'm sure I will. Thank you for the warm welcome and for introducing me to the beauty of Kyoto's traditions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=560dc1f4-b79e-4b51-b373-1337d475e871.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
