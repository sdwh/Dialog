How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey A, it's going pretty good. Have you heard about the recent DDoS attack on the gaming company's servers?<p class=message>Yes, I did. It caused a lot of downtime and lost revenue for them. Do you think our company could be targeted next?<p class="message sent">It's always a possibility. But I think we can take preventive measures to minimize the risk. Have you thought about implementing a web application firewall?<p class=message>That's a good idea. We can also work on strengthening our network security and limiting the bandwidth available to certain IP addresses.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Additionally, we should monitor our traffic closely and have a plan in place to mitigate any potential attacks.<p class=message>I agree. It's important to stay vigilant and be prepared for any potential threats.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We should also educate our employees on how to recognize and report any suspicious activity or phishing attempts.<p class=message>That's a great point. We need to have a company-wide culture of security awareness.<p class="message sent">Exactly! And since we're talking about security, have you seen any good movies or TV shows on the topic lately?<p class=message>Well, I've been watching Mr. Robot. It's a fictional show, but it's interesting to see the inner workings of a hacker's mind.<p class="message sent">Nice, I've heard good things about that show. I've actually been watching a YouTube channel called HackerSploit, it's been teaching me a lot about ethical hacking and cybersecurity.<p class=message>That sounds really interesting, I'll have to check it out. But for now, let's get back to preventing those DDoS attacks!<p class="message sent">Agreed. We have to stay proactive and ahead of the game.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed22da72-0fde-4af7-9684-d9412afba672.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
