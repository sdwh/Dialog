How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing pretty well. Are you ready for a game of Chinese Chess?<p class=message>I sure am! It's been ages since I last played. Do you mind giving me a quick refresher on the rules?<p class="message sent">Not at all. The game pieces all have specific movements and capture abilities. Let me show you on the board.<p class=message>Okay, I think I'm starting to get it. Wait, can that horse piece jump over the other pieces?<p class="message sent">Yep, that's right! It's called the Knight in western chess.<p class=message>Oh cool, I think I like that piece! So, are we playing for fun or is this a serious match?<p class="message sent">I'm all for having fun, but I won't go easy on you!<p class=message>Haha, fair enough. Let's do this!<p class="message sent">Alright, your move A. Show me what you got.<p class=message>Hmm, I'll move this elephant piece here. Watch out, I'm coming for your general!<p class="message sent">Oh, I see what you're trying to do. Well, how about I move my advisor here to protect my general?<p class=message>Nice move. But I have a surprise for you - I'll move this cannon to fire at your advisor!<p class="message sent">Ah, I see the trick now. Ok, let me protect my advisor with this elephant here.<p class=message>Oof, I didn't see that one coming. You're good at this!<p class="message sent">Thanks, I've been playing for a while. But don't worry, you'll get better with practice.<p class=message>Yeah, I'm definitely enjoying this game. It's like a mix between chess and stratego.<p class="message sent">Definitely, and the Chinese pieces add a whole new level of strategy. Hey, do you want to try a different opening strategy next time?<p class=message>I'd love to! Maybe something with the horses.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Well, it looks like you've got me in a tough spot here. Nice work, A!<p class=message>Thanks, B! This is really fun. Let's play again soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b300e923-4310-4899-ae96-0587f38fc9eb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
