How's business going today?<p class="message sent">Not bad, A. The heat is encouraging people to come and grab some cool treats from my stand. What about you?<p class=message>Sales are steady. I was thinking we could collaborate and offer a package deal - a hotdog with a drink and a small ice cream for a special price. It might attract more customers.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea! We could call it the "Chill and Grill Combo." I'm in.<p class=message>Perfect, let's do it! Hey, have you ever tried a hotdog with pineapple on it?<p class="message sent">Pineapple? No, I haven't. That sounds strange.<p class=message>Don't knock it until you try it. Trust me, it's delicious.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll give it a shot sometime. Speaking of trying new things, have you thought about adding any interesting new toppings to your hotdogs?<p class=message>Actually, I have been experimenting with some new flavors. I just tried a hotdog with crispy onions and chili sauce, and it's amazing.<p class="message sent">I love how creative you are! My customers always appreciate when I add new flavors to my ice cream flavors too.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What's your most popular flavor?<p class="message sent">Definitely mango. It's a crowd favorite.<p class=message>I'm not surprised. I always enjoy a nice mango smoothie when I need a refreshing break.<p class="message sent">Oh, I make mango smoothies too! Maybe we could offer a combo deal with a hotdog, a small mango smoothie, and a small ice cream.<p class=message>I love it! Our customers are going to be in for a treat.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to see the reaction on their faces when they taste our "Triple Treat" combo.<p class=message>Cheers to good business and delicious treats!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=040ff9b5-2404-480a-b2d5-9a00d90b24b2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
