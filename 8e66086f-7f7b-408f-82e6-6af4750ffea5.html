I never bothered to do that. Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I just accidentally deleted some important files and I want to make sure I can recover them.<p class="message sent">Oh no, that sounds like a nightmare. What are you planning to do?<p class=message>I was thinking of using a backup and restore tool. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Hmm, well I've heard good things about a program called Time Machine for Mac.<p class=message>I have a Windows computer, would that still work?<p class="message sent">Ah, no. It's only for Mac, unfortunately. But I'm sure there are similar programs for Windows.<p class=message>Alright, I'll take a look. Have you ever had to restore your system before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, one time my computer got infected with a virus and I had to restore it to factory settings.<p class=message>That must have taken forever.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it did. I actually wish I had a backup of my files back then.<p class=message>So, how often do you backup your system now?<p class="message sent">I try to do it every month or so, just to be safe.<p class=message>That's a good idea. I think I'll start doing that too.<p class="message sent">Trust me, it'll save you a lot of stress in the long run.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. I'll remember to back up my system regularly from now on.<p class="message sent">No problem, glad I could help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8e622645-3dd3-4a67-a6e3-2e38937079b2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
