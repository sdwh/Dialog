It's a standard for information security management systems.<p class=message>Right. It's really important to keep our data secure.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, what do you know about the data backup aspect of it?<p class=message>Well, I know that we need to back up our data regularly to protect it in case of any disasters or breaches.<p class="message sent">That's correct. And we also need to make sure the backups are stored in secure locations.<p class=message>So, what kind of backup do you think is the most secure?<p class="message sent">Hmm, there are different types of backups we can use, but I think cloud backups are pretty secure.<p class=message>Really? But what if the cloud service gets hacked?<p class="message sent">Good point. We should make sure we choose a reputable cloud service and implement other security measures to protect our data.<p class=message>That makes sense. But what if we want to use physical backup, like external hard drives?<p class="message sent">We can definitely use external hard drives, but we need to make sure they are encrypted and secured in a safe location.<p class=message>Got it. It's all starting to make sense now.<p class="message sent">Yeah, following ISO 27001 standards can seem overwhelming, but it's worth it to protect our data and maintain our clients' trust.<p class=message>Totally agree. It's like they say, "Better safe than sorry."<p class="message sent">Exactly. We don't want to end up on the news as the next data breach scandal.<p class=message>Haha, no way! Let's stick to following the standards and keep our data safe.<p class="message sent">For sure. And if we need any extra help, there are always experts we can consult with.<p class=message>Great idea. Thanks for talking this through with me, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. We're in this together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=65ec67fd-97e4-4aff-a5ae-5cba67db2945.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
