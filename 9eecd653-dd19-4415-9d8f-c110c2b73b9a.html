I heard you were working on some source code detection. How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! It's going okay, but I keep finding so many issues that need to be fixed.<p class=message>Ah, the joys of programming. What kind of issues are you seeing?<p class="message sent">Mostly just some bugs and inefficiencies in the code that could cause problems down the line.<p class=message>Well, identifying those issues is half the battle. Have you been able to start fixing them?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I was hoping you could give me some tips on how to tackle them.<p class=message>Of course! My advice would be to prioritize the most critical issues first and start fixing them one by one. That way, you'll make progress without getting overwhelmed.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. What about if I come across something I don't know how to fix?<p class=message>Don't be afraid to ask for help. We're all constantly learning, and sometimes it takes a fresh set of eyes to see a problem from a different angle.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice, A. It's good to know I have someone I can turn to for guidance.<p class=message>No problem, B. That's what teammates are for! Plus, the more we work together, the more we'll both learn and grow as developers.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm excited to keep learning and improving my skills with your help.<p class=message>Likewise, B. Let's keep up the good work and get this code in tip-top shape!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9ee8bb0e-f494-43cd-9cd3-ab2a684ca4a3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
