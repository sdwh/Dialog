Are you the driver taking me to Istanbul today?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's me. Good morning to you too! I hope you're ready for a beautiful day.<p class=message>Absolutely! I've never been to Istanbul before, so I'm really excited. Have you ever been there?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. Istanbul is a beautiful city with a fascinating history. You're going to love it!<p class=message>That's great to hear! I've heard the food is amazing there. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely! You have to try the Turkish kebab, and don't forget to sample some of the baklava for dessert.<p class=message>Yum! I can't wait. Do you have a favorite restaurant?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. There's a great spot called Karaköy Lokantası that serves some of the best food in the city.<p class=message>Thanks for the tip! I'll definitely check it out. By the way, have you always been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">No, actually. I used to be a professional basketball player back in the day.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive! Why did you become a driver instead?<p class="message sent">Well, I'll be honest – I wasn't quite good enough to make it to the NBA. But driving a taxi allows me to meet interesting people like you and travel to new places.<p class=message>That's a great way to look at it. Thanks for driving me to Istanbul today. I'm really looking forward to the journey.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. We'll be there before you know it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1e386bdf-e90b-406a-8458-01081fe754c4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
