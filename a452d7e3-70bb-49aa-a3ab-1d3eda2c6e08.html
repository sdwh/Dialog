Our guests will be thrilled. Speaking of guests, did you hear about the English couple who came in yesterday?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What happened?<p class=message>They were quite the characters. They requested a boiled egg for their dessert!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Are you serious? I've never heard of that before.<p class=message>(laughs) Apparently it's a British classic. But don't worry, they still loved your lemon tart.<p class="message sent">(relieved) Phew! I'm glad they enjoyed it. By the way, have you tried the new duck confit dish in the restaurant?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's absolutely delicious. The meat is so tender and the sauce is divine.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! I love when we can offer new and exciting dishes to our guests.<p class=message>Speaking of excitement, have you heard about the upcoming baking competition in the city?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Please tell me more!<p class=message>It's a huge event with pastry chefs from all over China. The winner gets a scholarship to study at a prestigious culinary school in Paris.<p class="message sent">Wow! That sounds amazing. I've always wanted to visit Paris and learn from the masters.<p class=message>You should definitely consider entering, Chef B. Your skills are top-notch.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Thank you, Manager A. I'll definitely look into it.<p class=message>(smiling back) I have no doubt you're going to blow them away with your culinary creations.<p class="message sent">(grinning) You're too kind. But with your management skills and my baking skills, we're a winning team.<p class=message>(nodding) Absolutely! Our guests always come first, and we'll make sure they leave with a full stomach and a smile on their face.<p class="message sent">(agreeing) That's the spirit.
