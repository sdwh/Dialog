How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">It's going great, thank you for asking. I'm excited to be driving you to Atlanta today.<p class=message>Yes, me too! Have you ever been to Atlanta before?<p class="message sent">Oh, many times. I love visiting the city, there's so much to see and do.<p class=message>That's great to hear, any recommendations on what to do while we're there?<p class="message sent">Well, the Georgia Aquarium is a must-see, it's the largest aquarium in the world. And if you're a fan of Coca-Cola, you can visit the World of Coca-Cola, it's so refreshing!<p class=message>Oh, wow, sounds like a lot of fun. Have you tried any of the local cuisine?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! My favorite spot is Mary Mac's Tea Room, they serve the best southern food in town.<p class=message>Yum, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Are there any funny stories you have from your time as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh, there sure are. One time, I had a passenger who was in such a hurry to catch a flight that he forgot his phone in my car. I called his mom, who had been his emergency contact, and she asked me to play a joke on him by pretending that I had lost the phone.<p class=message>Haha, that's hilarious! Did you follow through with it?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I told him I had found a really valuable phone and kept pretending it was something really special until he came to pick it up.<p class=message>You're a prankster, I like it! Thanks for sharing that story with me. I'm excited to explore Atlanta and see everything for myself.<p class="message sent">Of course, it'll be my pleasure to show you around. We'll be there in no time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9a9f844e-e8fd-4d53-b85a-57a13b5f106a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
