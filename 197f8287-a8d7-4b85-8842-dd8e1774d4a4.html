The bread smells amazing today.<p class="message sent">Bonjour, A! Thanks, I've been experimenting with new flavors for the baguettes.<p class=message>Oh, I see. I hope you don't mind if I steal a taste.<p class="message sent">Of course not, go ahead!<p class=message>Mmm, this tastes incredible. I'm thinking it would pair well with a nice camembert cheese.<p class="message sent">Yes, that would be a great combination. Speaking of cheese, have you tried the croissants with Gruyère?<p class=message>No, I haven't. How are they?<p class="message sent">They're delicious! The cheese adds a savory twist to the classic croissant.<p class=message>I'll have to try one for breakfast tomorrow. By the way, have you met the new apprentice? He seems to be picking up the techniques quickly.<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. He's enthusiastic and eager to learn. I think he'll be a great addition to the team.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Our shop is getting quite popular lately. Did you hear that food blogger raving about our éclairs?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. It's exciting to see our hard work paying off.<p class=message>Definitely. Hey, have you ever thought about opening your own bakery someday?<p class="message sent">Oh, all the time. But for now, I'm happy baking here and learning from you and our team.<p class=message>That's a good mindset to have. Who knows, maybe we'll see our bakery franchised all over France one day!<p class="message sent">Haha, who knows? But for now, let's focus on creating delicious treats for our customers.<p class=message>Agreed. Hey, speaking of treats, I've been craving some macarons. Want to make some after our lunch break?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I've got some new flavors I want to try out anyways.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=197ec5cc-5f71-4f8f-9d86-60f080846b8f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
