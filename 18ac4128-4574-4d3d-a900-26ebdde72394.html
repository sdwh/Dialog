How's everything going with our grapes?<p class="message sent">Hey A! Everything is going great. The grapes are looking great this year, I think we're going to have an outstanding vintage.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear! I was thinking of trying something new this year- what do you think about adding a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot?<p class="message sent">Hmm, interesting idea. Cabernet Sauvignon certainly would add a nice body but I'm not sure how it would blend with the Merlot. Why don't we try a small batch and see how it comes out?<p class=message>Great idea! Speaking of small batches, have you taste-tested our Gew√ºrztraminer yet?<p class="message sent">Actually, I did just try it yesterday. It's got a really nice floral nose and some surprise acidity on the finish. I think it's going to be one of our most popular offerings.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds delicious. I'll have to try it myself later. Speaking of popular offerings, have you seen the crowds coming in for our tasting room on the weekends?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's been quite busy lately. We're going to have to start adding some extra staff just to keep up with demand.<p class=message>Well, that's certainly a good problem to have. I'm just happy that our hard work is paying off.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. It's always satisfying to see people enjoy the fruits of our labor. Speaking of which, have you seen the new barrel room we're setting up?<p class=message>No, I haven't had the chance to check it out yet. What's it like?<p class="message sent">It's pretty impressive- we're adding some new oak barrels and even some stainless steel ones for some of our whites. It's going to be a great addition to our wine-making process.<p class=message>That's exciting news! I can't wait to see it in action. Thanks for all your hard work, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's a pleasure to work with you and make some great wine!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=18aba537-5b44-4d85-b6a7-67be3ff29f1e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
