Did you catch anything good today?<p class=message>Oh, I caught some pretty decent fish, but I'm not here to sell them. I just wanted to chat about seafood.<p class="message sent">Of course, what's on your mind?<p class=message>I'm curious about the seafood supply at your restaurant. Do you have a lot of fresh catches?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We pride ourselves on the quality of our seafood. We have a great relationship with local fishermen, so our supply is always fresh.<p class=message>That's impressive. How do you decide what to put on your menu?<p class="message sent">We try to keep a good variety. Of course, it all depends on what's in season and what's available. But we always have some kind of fish, shellfish, and other seafood options.<p class=message>Well, I have to tell you, I'm a big seafood fan, and I appreciate a good selection. I'll definitely have to come by and check out your menu.<p class="message sent">You won't be disappointed! Is there any particular type of seafood you're interested in?<p class=message>Honestly, I'm open to trying new things. I love classic dishes like lobster and shrimp, but I'm also down for some adventurous things like octopus or eel.<p class="message sent">Well, we have all of that and more. And if you come by at the right time, you might even catch one of our special dishes, like pan-seared scallops with a truffle butter sauce.<p class=message>Now you're really making my mouth water! I'll definitely be stopping by soon. Thanks for the chat.<p class="message sent">Anytime. And if you happen to catch anything extra special on your next fishing trip, don't hesitate to bring it here. We'd love to cook it up for you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d80a02de-9327-414b-94b4-4e6ea7cfa55f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
