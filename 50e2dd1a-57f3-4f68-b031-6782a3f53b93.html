What is it all about?<p class=message>It's the international standard for information security management system. Basically, it helps organizations manage and protect their sensitive information.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Why do you ask?<p class=message>I was just wondering if your company has implemented it yet.<p class="message sent">Nope, we haven't. Do you think it's necessary?<p class=message>Absolutely! Cybersecurity threats are on the rise and it's important to ensure that our information is secure.<p class="message sent">True, but it sounds like it could be a lot of work.<p class=message>Yes, it does require some effort, but once you're certified, it gives a lot of peace of mind.<p class="message sent">I see. Is there any benefit to implementing ISO 27001 aside from security?<p class=message>Well, for one, it demonstrates to clients and stakeholders that your organization takes its security seriously. Additionally, it can help you comply with other regulations like GDPR.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I'll definitely bring this up to my manager and see if it's something we should pursue.<p class=message>Great! I can also send you some more information about the certification process and what it entails.<p class="message sent">That would be very helpful. Thanks, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to protecting our information.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=50e1bd4d-5e56-4fbf-a298-cbd2b20453d0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
