Ready for our training session?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm doing pretty good! I've been looking forward to this all week.<p class=message>Great to hear! So, what's on the agenda for today?<p class="message sent">Well, I was hoping we could work on my form for deadlifts. I've been having trouble keeping my back straight.<p class=message>Absolutely, we can definitely focus on that. But first, let's warm up with some jumping jacks.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, although you know I always feel a bit silly doing those.<p class=message>Trust me, nobody looks cool doing jumping jacks. But they're a great way to get the blood pumping!<p class="message sent">Good point. Okay, let's get started.<p class=message>Alright, time for some deadlifts. Remember to keep your back straight and your core engaged.<p class="message sent">Got it. I'm really feeling the burn in my glutes and hamstrings!<p class=message>That means you're doing it right. And if you need a break, just let me know.<p class="message sent">No pain, no gain, right?<p class=message>Exactly! Okay, let's switch it up and do some lunges now.<p class="message sent">Lunges, huh? I have a love-hate relationship with these.<p class=message>Well, today we're going to make them your new favorite exercise.<p class="message sent">Challenge accepted.<p class="message sent">Wow, I'm absolutely wiped out.<p class=message>That's the sign of a good workout! Rest up now, and don't forget to stretch.<p class="message sent">Thanks for pushing me, A. I always feel so much better after our sessions.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, B. Just doing my job as your trusty fitness coach.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8f91d21b-5d5a-4941-a8f8-315e53c59d5d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
