How are you doing today, B?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing pretty well. It's really busy in here today, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it sure is. We have lots of customers coming in for lunch.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What can I help you with today, B?<p class="message sent">I'm making some special iced tea today with fresh lemon and mint. Would you like to try some?<p class=message>Oh, that sounds really refreshing. I'll definitely try a glass of that.<p class="message sent">Great! And what kind of bento box do you recommend for lunch?<p class=message>We have a new teriyaki chicken bento that's been really popular. It comes with rice, vegetables, and a salad.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. I'll order one of those.<p class=message>Great choice. I'll get started on making that for you.<p class="message sent">Thanks. By the way, I heard that you're really good at making onigiri too. Do you have any tips for how to make them perfectly?<p class=message>Well, it's all about getting the right balance of rice and filling. And you have to make sure that they're shaped correctly, or they'll fall apart.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I'll have to try making them at home sometime.<p class=message>Definitely! They're really filling and great for lunch on the go.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, I should probably get back to making more teas and bento boxes. Thanks for your help, A.<p class=message>You're welcome. Have a great day, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a05c042e-efae-455a-bedd-8d2a38499920.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
