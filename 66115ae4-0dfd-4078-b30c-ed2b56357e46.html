It's great to see you today. Have you had a chance to review the design options that we sent over last week?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. They all look wonderful, but I'm leaning towards Option C. I just have a few questions about that design.<p class=message>Sure, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have. What are your concerns?<p class="message sent">Well, I want to make sure that the colors we choose will be pleasing to everyone. What do you think about using a brighter shade of blue?<p class=message>That's a great idea! A vibrant blue can give the design some energy and really make it pop. Let's see how we can incorporate that into the design.<p class="message sent">Also, I was thinking about adding some graphics to the background. Do you have any suggestions for what type of graphics we can use?<p class=message>How about some playful geometric shapes? We can use them to add some interest without being too distracting.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! I am really excited to see the final product. Thanks for all your help, A.<p class=message>Of course, we are always happy to work with you to create a design that you love. It's been a pleasure working with you, B.<p class="message sent">It's always a pleasure working with you too, A. I'll be in touch soon about the final details.<p class=message>Sounds great, looking forward to it. Have a wonderful day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=660f44bd-595d-4dcc-bbc4-0fa430f7d8f1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
