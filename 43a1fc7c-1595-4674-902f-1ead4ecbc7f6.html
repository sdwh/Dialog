Just fixing a few minor issues here and there.<p class=message>Great! I hope we can finish up soon. I want to get back out on the track.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, we're working as fast as we can without sacrificing quality.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. By the way, did you hear about the driver who got a speeding ticket on his way to the race?<p class="message sent">No, I didn't. What happened?<p class=message>He said he was just trying to get into the racing spirit!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Good one! Speaking of spirit, have you tried the new energy drink we're sponsoring?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. It's pretty good, but I don't know if it's helping me go any faster.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Maybe we need to add some rocket fuel to the mix!<p class=message>(laughs) That might be a bit extreme, but I'm willing to try anything to shave off a couple of seconds.<p class="message sent">Well, let's focus on getting the car in top shape first. We don't want any mechanical failures during the race.<p class=message>Agreed. It's always better to be safe than sorry. By the way, have you heard any rumors about who might win this race?<p class="message sent">I heard that the defending champion has been working on a new engine that's supposed to blow away the competition.<p class=message>(smirks) Looks like we've got our work cut out for us then.<p class="message sent">As long as we stay focused and keep our heads in the game, I believe we have a shot at the podium.<p class=message>I like the sound of that! Let's get back to work and make sure we're ready for anything that comes our way.<p class="message sent">You got it! We'll get this car running smoothly in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=43a171af-0a46-40e4-aef8-89949df4d85f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
