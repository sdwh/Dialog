It's going well, thanks. And you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks. So we're headed to Perth, huh?<p class="message sent">That's right! Are you excited for your trip?<p class=message>Definitely. I've heard so much about the beaches and the wildlife there.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, the beaches are amazing. And if you're lucky, you might spot a kangaroo or two!<p class=message>That would be incredible. Have you ever seen one?<p class="message sent">Sure have. There's actually a reserve near Perth where you can see them in their natural habitat.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a must-see. How long have you been driving taxis?<p class="message sent">I've been doing it for about 10 years now. It's a pretty good job, and I get to meet all kinds of interesting people.<p class=message>That's great. What's the most interesting conversation you've had with a passenger?<p class="message sent">Well, I've had some funny ones. Once, I had a guy who tried to teach me how to do a magic trick.<p class=message>Really? Did you learn it?<p class="message sent">Ha! I wish. It was something with a coin and some moves that I couldn't quite follow.<p class=message>Sounds tricky. Do you have any favorite spots in Perth that you recommend?<p class="message sent">Definitely take a stroll through Kings Park - it's beautiful. And if you're into seafood, Cottesloe Beach has some amazing restaurants.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendations. I can't wait to explore the city. You make it sound so wonderful!<p class="message sent">It really is. Enjoy your trip and have a great time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=771b7132-8e9b-4348-b88e-36d1012b0bbb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
