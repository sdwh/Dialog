I just checked in to my room, and I wanted to confirm the minibar's content and prices.<p class="message sent">Of course, sir. Allow me a moment to check that with our system. Can I have your room number, please?<p class=message>Sure. It's room number 305.<p class="message sent">Thank you, sir. Let me see... Ok, so in your minibar, there are sodas, beers, and snacks.<p class=message>Hmm, that sounds good. Can you tell me the prices?<p class="message sent">Sure, sir. Let me just look it up... Alright, the sodas are $2 each, and the beers are $4. Snacks range between $2 and $5, depending on the item.<p class=message>Okay, thank you for confirming that. Can you give me a recommendation for snacks? I'm a bit hungry, to be honest.<p class="message sent">Well, our bestsellers are the chips and nuts. But if you're looking for something more filling, we also have sandwiches and instant noodles.<p class=message>Sounds good! I'll have some chips and a beer. Can you also recommend activities I can do around this area?<p class="message sent">Certainly, sir. There are plenty of options for activities. We have a swimming pool, a fitness center, and a restaurant as well. If you're interested in venturing out, there are some attractions nearby â€“ a museum, a park, and a shopping center.<p class=message>Wow, there are a lot of options. I think I'm going to need a few more days to explore!<p class="message sent">That's great to hear, sir! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.<p class=message>Sure will. Thanks for your help!<p class="message sent">My pleasure, sir! Have a great stay.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a0c99f3b-f572-4d31-ac1c-a7cd8d1b16d1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
