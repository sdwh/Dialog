How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Hi there, I've been driving for about 5 years now. How about you, have you ever driven a taxi before?<p class=message>Haha, no way! I only know how to drive a car, not a taxi.<p class="message sent">Driving a taxi is not that different from driving a car, except you have to deal with different kinds of passengers.<p class=message>I can only imagine. Do you have any funny stories to share?<p class="message sent">Well, one time a group of tourists got into my car and tried to speak Chinese to me. It was hilarious because I don't speak Chinese at all.<p class=message>That must have been quite the language barrier. Have you had any interesting passengers lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. Yesterday I had a woman who had so much luggage, there was barely any room for her. We had to get creative to make it all fit.<p class=message>You must have quite the Tetris skills!<p class="message sent">Haha, I guess you could say that. What brings you to Shanghai today?<p class=message>I'm visiting a friend who lives in the city. What do you recommend I see while I'm here?<p class="message sent">You should definitely check out the Bund, it's the most famous tourist attraction in Shanghai. And if you're feeling adventurous, you could try some traditional street foods.<p class=message>That sounds like a great plan. Thanks for the recommendations!<p class="message sent">No problem. I hope you have a great time in Shanghai!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=83850a2f-e712-4381-8ffd-d6e90e00b88e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
