How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hi, Nurse A! I'm feeling much better, thanks! I think the medication you prescribed is working wonders.<p class=message>That's great to hear! How are you doing with following the medication schedule we discussed last time?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I'm having a bit of trouble remembering to take my pills on time.<p class=message>No worries, that's a common issue. Do you think setting alarms on your phone would help?<p class="message sent">Actually, I tried that but kept ignoring the alarms. Maybe a friend reminding me would be better.<p class=message>That's a good idea. You could also try leaving a sticky note on your fridge or bathroom mirror to help remind you.<p class="message sent">I like that! I'll give it a shot. How about the side effects of the medication?<p class=message>It's important to let me know if you're experiencing any unusual symptoms. But generally, the side effects are minimal for this medication.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. I was worried I would feel drowsy or nauseous.<p class=message>Not to worry! Just remember to take the medication with food and plenty of water to prevent any stomach upset.<p class="message sent">Got it. Thank you, Nurse A! You're the best.<p class=message>No problem at all! Remember, I'm here to help you every step of the way.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=51b83ad7-d8e5-4fe5-8734-bc5432446b36.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
