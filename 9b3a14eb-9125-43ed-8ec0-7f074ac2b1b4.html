We have several guided tours available that will take you around and give you a brief on Capitol Hill's history.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. Can you recommend any specific tours?<p class=message>Of course, our most popular one is the Capitol Building tour which includes a visit to the Rotunda, Crypt, and National Statuary Hall.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Can I also visit any of the offices within the Capitol Building?<p class=message>Unfortunately, visiting the offices is not included in the guided tour, but you can visit several of the offices located in the adjacent buildings.<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds good to me. Also, are there any nearby restaurants you recommend?<p class=message>Yes, there are several great restaurants nearby ranging from upscale to casual. Can I grab your preferences?<p class="message sent">Sure, I prefer casual and affordable eating options.<p class=message>Great! The closest options would be Good Stuff Eatery, We the Pizza, or the trendy Shake Shack.<p class="message sent">Wow, I've heard a lot about Shake Shack. I will definitely try that one out.<p class=message>It's a popular spot around here, and we highly recommend it. Do you have any other questions?<p class="message sent">No, that's perfect.
