Welcome to the rainforest, my name is Sarah and I'll be your tour guide for today's eco-tour.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Sarah. I'm excited to explore the rainforest. What kind of activities do we have planned?<p class=message>Well, we'll be trekking through the forest on a nature walk, spotting exotic flora and fauna, and stopping at a natural swimming hole for a refreshing swim.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. What kind of wildlife can we expect to see?<p class=message>We have a chance to spot tree kangaroos, wallabies, and a variety of bird species such as the noisy Pitta and Laughing Kookaburra.<p class="message sent">Wow, I've never heard of a tree kangaroo before. Are they common in this area?<p class=message>They're quite rare, actually. But we're lucky to be in one of the few places in the world where they can be found.<p class="message sent">That's amazing! What's the best way to spot them?<p class=message>We'll keep an eye out for their droppings and scratches on the trees. If we're lucky, we might even get a glimpse of one high up in the canopy.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely keep an eye out for them. Are there any dangers we should be aware of?<p class=message>There are some venomous snakes and spiders, but they're not usually aggressive towards humans. Just remember to stay on the designated paths and not touch any wildlife.<p class="message sent">Got it. I'm looking forward to the swim at the end of the tour. Is the water cold?<p class=message>The water is refreshing but not too cold. It's the perfect way to cool off after a long walk in the rainforest.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great way to end the tour. Thank you for being our guide, Sarah.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. Let's head off and see what kind of wildlife we can discover today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b303c9ca-13c9-4575-aeb9-9c7e0ceb5d48.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
