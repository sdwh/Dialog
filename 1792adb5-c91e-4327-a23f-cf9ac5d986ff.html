Your chicken rice looks delicious. Can I have one plate, please?<p class="message sent">Of course! And would you like a glass of soy milk to go with that?<p class=message>Yes, please. That sounds perfect for breakfast.<p class="message sent">So, have you tried our soy milk before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it different from regular milk?<p class="message sent">It's made from soybeans instead of cow's milk, so it's lower in fat and lactose-free. Plus, it's a staple breakfast beverage in Singapore.<p class=message>That sounds healthy and refreshing. I'll give it a try.<p class="message sent">You won't be disappointed! Our soy milk is freshly made every day.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. And your chicken rice is the real deal, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We use the traditional Hainanese method to cook the chicken and rice, and it's served with our secret chili sauce.<p class=message>Secret chili sauce? Now, you got my attention. How spicy is it?<p class="message sent">It's not too spicy, just enough to give a kick to the dish. You'll love it!<p class=message>I'm excited to try it. Thank you for the recommendation.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. I'm sure you'll enjoy your breakfast. Let me know how it taste!<p class=message>Sure thing. And by the way, have you been in business for a long time?<p class="message sent">Yes, my family has been in the soy milk business for generations, and we recently partnered with this chicken rice stall to offer a complete breakfast experience.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I love it when local businesses come together like this.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's a win-win situation for everyone, especially for our customers who get to enjoy authentic food.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Thank you for the delicious breakfast and the lovely chat.<p class="message sent">Anytime! Have a good day ahead!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=178d7311-fa4b-42b1-86a2-4189802378ed.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
