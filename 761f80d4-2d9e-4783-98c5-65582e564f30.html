It's all about keeping sensitive data and information secure right?<p class=message>Absolutely, but did you also know it includes physical security measures like access control?<p class="message sent">I did, and it also covers things like CCTV and alarm systems, right?<p class=message>Yes, you're right! It's like a security blanket for your data.<p class="message sent">Ha! I like that analogy. It's like wrapping your data up in a cozy blanket to make sure nothing bad happens.<p class=message>Exactly! And just like how you wouldn't let anyone steal your cozy blanket, you shouldn't let unauthorized people access your data.<p class="message sent">Nice one! So, what are some of the most important physical security elements for ISO 27001?<p class=message>Well, secure access points, such as biometric or keycard access, are definitely up there. Plus, making sure that employees are trained on security protocols.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So it's not just about fancy gadgets, but also making sure everyone is aware of the importance of security measures.<p class=message>You got it! It's about being proactive and keeping your data safe before anything bad happens.<p class="message sent">I'm sold! I'll make sure to double check our security protocols and see if we're ISO 27001 compliant.<p class=message>Good idea! You can never be too safe when it comes to sensitive data. Plus, it'll make ISO auditors happy to see you're on top of things!<p class="message sent">Haha, I definitely want to keep the auditors happy. Thanks for chatting about ISO physical security with me!<p class=message>No problem, always happy to talk about keeping data safe.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=761d4ffb-46b6-4f4b-9020-08fc9985ae4f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
