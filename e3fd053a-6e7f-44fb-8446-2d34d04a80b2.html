It's so good!<p class="message sent">Of course, I have! It's my favorite dish in this restaurant.<p class=message>Really? I thought that was the spicy noodles you always order.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's my go-to dish, but the fried rice is an equally delicious alternative.<p class=message>I could never choose between them. Maybe we should order both and share?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great plan. Two delicious dishes in one meal.<p class=message>Do you like your fried rice with vegetables or meat?<p class="message sent">I prefer vegetables, but I won't say no to some chicken or shrimp.<p class=message>Same here. The mix of textures and flavors is what makes fried rice so irresistible.<p class="message sent">You're absolutely right. I also love how versatile it is. You can have it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.<p class=message>Yeah, it's like the perfect dish for any time of day. Plus, it's so easy to make at home.<p class="message sent">True, but it never tastes as good as when you order it from a restaurant.<p class=message>That's because they add some secret ingredient that we don't know about.<p class="message sent">Or maybe it's just the wok hei that we can't replicate at home.<p class=message>That's another possibility. But one thing is for sure: we'll always come back to this restaurant for their amazing fried rice.<p class="message sent">Totally agree.
