He was pretty impressive!<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did! He had some serious talent! I was amazed by his tricks.<p class=message>Right? I couldn't believe my eyes when he started juggling those flaming torches!<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah, that was crazy! I was afraid he was going to burn his face.<p class=message>I was thinking the same thing! But he made it look so easy. I guess practice really does make perfect.<p class="message sent">Definitely! He must have spent hours and hours honing his craft.<p class=message>And the way he was interacting with the audience was hilarious! I've never seen a street performer with such great banter.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, he was definitely entertaining. I loved it when he pulled a volunteer from the crowd to help him with his act.<p class=message>Me too! That lady was so funny. I'm surprised she didn't steal the show herself.<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah, she was a natural! But the performer was gracious and made sure to give her plenty of attention.<p class=message>Overall, I think that was one of the best street performances I've seen in a while. I'm glad we stopped to watch.<p class="message sent">Same here! It was a great way to spend a sunny afternoon in Melbourne.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=02c1edaf-eab4-4ef7-b436-41c9554f585b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
