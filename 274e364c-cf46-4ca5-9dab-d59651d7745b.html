Have you informed our team lead about the findings yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I plan on doing that after I finish writing up the bug reports.<p class=message>Speaking of bug reports, have you tried out that new automated testing tool that our colleague recommended?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I tested it out and it works like a charm. I think we should start utilizing it more to catch potential problems early on.<p class=message>That's a great idea. We can run the automated tests alongside our manual tests to ensure maximum coverage.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And with our revamped testing strategy, we can ensure that our code is of the highest quality before we launch it.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. It's always better to catch potential problems early on than to deal with them after deployment.<p class="message sent">Indeed. And with our combined expertise, I'm confident that we'll be able to deliver a top-notch product.<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's get to work and make sure that everything runs like clockwork!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=274dd533-06d5-4749-97e4-e611f67d1167.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
