Welcome to our farm!<p class="message sent">Hi there! Thanks for having me. I'm excited to do some fruit picking today.<p class=message>Well, you're in the right place. We've got all sorts of fruits growing here - apples, pears, peaches, you name it.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic! I've never done any fruit picking before, so I'm looking forward to the experience.<p class=message>No worries, mate. We'll show you the ropes. Just make sure you're wearing some comfortable clothes and a hat to protect you from the sun.<p class="message sent">Will do. So, what's the best way to pick these fruits?<p class=message>Well, for the taller trees, we have ladders that we can use to reach the higher branches. But for some of the shorter trees, you can just reach up and pluck the fruit off the branches.<p class="message sent">Got it. Do you have any tips for finding the ripest fruit?<p class=message>Look for the ones that are a bit softer to the touch and have a nice, bright color. And if you're not sure, just give it a taste!<p class="message sent">(laughs) I like your thinking! Speaking of taste, what do you recommend as the best fruit to try here?<p class=message>Oh, that's a tough one. They're all pretty tasty if you ask me. But if I had to choose, I'd go with the peaches - they're just delicious this time of year.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Thanks for the recommendation! This is really a lovely farm you have here.<p class=message>Thanks, mate. We work hard to keep it in good shape. And we really appreciate visitors like you who want to come and see what we do.<p class="message sent">Well, it's my pleasure. I love learning about different types of agriculture and the work that goes into it.<p class=message>That's great to hear. We're always happy to share our knowledge with others who are interested.<p class="message sent">Well, count me in. I'm soaking up all the information I can!<p class=message>Glad to hear it, mate. And don't worry - we'll make sure you leave here with a basket full of delicious fruit to take home.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=18147277-1dc7-4d7c-8608-5849672f1faa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
