How can I help you today?<p class=message>I'm a farmer and I've come to buy some fresh seafood for my family. Could you recommend something?<p class="message sent">Of course! We have some delicious fresh crabs and shrimps today. Do you like spicy food?<p class=message>Yes, I do! I love spicy food.<p class="message sent">Then you will definitely want to try our signature spicy shrimp dish. It's always a hit with our customers.<p class=message>Sounds tasty! How many should I buy for a family of four?<p class="message sent">I would recommend about half a pound per person, so two pounds should be enough.<p class=message>Got it. And how about the crabs?<p class="message sent">Our crabs are very fresh and sweet. They are perfect for stir-frying with ginger and scallions.<p class=message>Hmm, that sounds delicious too. Maybe I'll get some of those as well.<p class="message sent">Great choice! We also have some fresh clams and squid today. Would you like to try some of those too?<p class=message>Sure, why not? I'm feeling adventurous today.<p class="message sent">Excellent! We'll get you some of the best clams and squid we have. You won't be disappointed.<p class=message>Thank you so much for your help.
