It was amazing! I could eat it every day!<p class=message>I know right? It's like a crispy heaven on a plate. Did you have it with any sides?<p class="message sent">Of course, I had it with some creamy mashed potatoes and a side salad. The combination was perfect.<p class=message>Oh, you're making me crave it now. I can just imagine the crunch sound it makes when you bite into it.<p class="message sent">It's seriously addictive. And the best part is that it's a classic Austrian dish.<p class=message>I've always wanted to visit Austria and have the authentic Wiener Schnitzel there.<p class="message sent">Me too! I bet it tastes even better when you're in the country where it originated from.<p class=message>Exactly. And speaking of international travels, have you tried Schnitzel in any other country?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I had it in Germany and Switzerland, but they weren't as good as the Austrian one.<p class=message>That's interesting. It just proves that the original dish always wins.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And it also makes me appreciate Austrian cuisine even more.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Now, let's plan a trip to Austria to taste the real deal Wiener Schnitzel!<p class="message sent">Yes! And we can try all the other amazing Austrian dishes too. The foodie in me can't wait.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8d40cf6e-1115-48e6-a2d0-125e44eb0b89.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
