I'm a fisherman here at the port. I heard your seafood restaurant is in need of fresh seafood supplies. Can I offer you some of my catch today?<p class="message sent">Hello, A! Yes, we're always looking for fresh and tasty seafood. What do you have available?<p class=message>I've got some delicious lobsters and crabs caught just this morning. They're really fresh and come in different sizes. Would you be interested?<p class="message sent">That sounds great! We can definitely put them on our menu. How much are you selling them for?<p class=message>I can give you a good price of $15 per pound for the lobsters and $10 per pound for the crabs. It's a real bargain!<p class="message sent">That's a fair deal, A. We'll take them. Do you have any suggestions on how we should prepare them?<p class=message>Steamed with garlic butter is always popular. Or, if you want to be adventurous, try making some spicy crab cakes or lobster bisque soup.<p class="message sent">Those are great ideas. We'll definitely try them. Do you have any other seafood that you can recommend for our menu?<p class=message>Yes, I also have some fresh fish such as salmon, tuna, and cod. They're also great for grilling, frying or baking.<p class="message sent">Perfect! We'll add them to our menu too. Thanks for your help, A. We really appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem. It's my pleasure to supply you with the best seafood around. Maybe next time, you'll even let me join you for a tasting.<p class="message sent">Of course! We'd love to have your input on our seafood dishes. Make sure to come visit us soon.<p class=message>It's a deal! Thank you again, Mr. B. Have a great day.<p class="message sent">You too, A. Good luck with your fishing!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a930f4a5-22b8-48a6-9943-864ca4b2334c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
