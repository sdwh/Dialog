You're the network security expert, right? I've got a question for you.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A! Shoot.<p class=message>How do we prevent DDoS attacks on our website?<p class="message sent">Ah, the dreaded DDoS attack. Well, there are a few things we can do. First, we can limit the number of requests that come from a single IP address.<p class=message>So, like, if someone's trying to spam our website with a bunch of requests from one computer, we can stop them?<p class="message sent">Exactly! We can also set up filters to block known attack patterns and limit traffic from certain regions.<p class=message>That sounds pretty intense. What if we get overwhelmed by traffic, though?<p class="message sent">If it's really bad, we can always work with our web host to add more bandwidth and spread the traffic out over more servers.<p class=message>Makes sense. But isn't there a way to stop the attacks before they even get to us?<p class="message sent">Definitely. We can use a DDoS protection service to filter out malicious traffic before it even hits our server.<p class=message>That sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie. How does it work?<p class="message sent">Basically, the service separates legitimate traffic from the bad stuff using advanced algorithms and machine learning. It's pretty cool.<p class=message>Wow. Sounds like we've got a lot of options to choose from.<p class="message sent">We sure do. And the best part is, by preventing DDoS attacks, we can keep our website online and our customers happy!<p class=message>Agreed. Speaking of customers, what do we tell them if the website does go down?<p class="message sent">We can set up a notification system to let them know what's going on and when we expect things to be back up and running.<p class=message>Nice. You really know your stuff, B.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. It's all in a day's work for a network security expert.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a69814ae-60b7-4f7b-b2e3-c059984ac426.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
