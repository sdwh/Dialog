How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing good, A! What's on the menu for today?<p class=message>Today we're serving up some classic southern dishes like fried chicken, mac and cheese, and collard greens.<p class="message sent">Yum, sounds delicious! Have we gotten any new reviews lately?<p class=message>Yeah, we received a review on our website that said our fried catfish was the best they've ever had!<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! Speaking of catfish, have we ordered more for next week's menu?<p class=message>Yes, I just double-checked and we have plenty of catfish to last us through the next few weeks.<p class="message sent">Perfect! Have you thought about adding any new desserts to the menu?<p class=message>Actually, I was thinking about making some homemade banana pudding. What do you think?<p class="message sent">I love banana pudding! Let's definitely add it to the menu.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! By the way, have you tried the new hot sauce we ordered?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I'm excited to try it out. How spicy is it?<p class=message>It's pretty spicy, but not too overwhelming. I think it'll be a great addition to our barbecue dishes.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! And finally, have you scheduled our weekly staff meeting yet?<p class=message>Yes, tomorrow at 10am. I'll be sending out a reminder email shortly.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Thanks, A!
