Thank you for agreeing to meet me for this interview!<p class="message sent">Of course, happy to chat with you. What can I help you with today?<p class=message>Well, I heard that you recently started a new hobby. Can you tell us a bit about it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I started learning how to bake bread. It’s been a really fun experience.<p class=message>That’s great! What kind of bread have you been making?<p class="message sent">Mostly sourdough bread, but I’ve also tried making brioche and focaccia.<p class=message>Impressive! Do you have any tips for someone who wants to start learning how to bake bread?<p class="message sent">Patience is key. And don’t be afraid to make mistakes, it’s all part of the learning process.<p class=message>Wise words. So, I heard you also have a dog. Tell me more about your furry friend.<p class="message sent">Yes, I have a golden retriever named Charlie. He’s the biggest goofball and always keeps me on my toes.<p class=message>Aw, I love golden retrievers! Do you take him on any adventures?<p class="message sent">We love going to the park and playing frisbee. He’s not the best at catching, but it’s still a blast.<p class=message>Sounds like a good time. So, one last question. What’s your guilty pleasure when it comes to food?<p class="message sent">Definitely ice cream. I could eat a whole tub in one sitting if I’m not careful.<p class=message>Hey, no shame in that! Thanks for sharing with us today, it was great getting to know you.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me! It was a pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b064b84f-1417-4e42-a7f7-d0670bc35975.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
