I see you're a warrior. I'm a skilled elf archer. How about we work together to find the missing villagers?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan to me. I heard that they were last seen heading towards the forest. Have you scouted the area yet?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I saw some footprints, but they seem to have been erased by the rain. I think we should follow the river that runs through the forest.<p class="message sent">Good idea. I'll take the lead since I have a knack for tracking. By the way, have you ever shot an arrow while riding a horse?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's quite a thrilling experience. Have you ever charged into battle on horseback?<p class="message sent">Many times. I can't count how many enemies I've knocked off their feet with my trusty steed. But let's focus on the task at hand. We need to find those villagers.<p class=message>I agree. I'll stay back and provide cover while you track. Oh, do you know any good jokes to lighten up the mood?<p class="message sent">Sure. What do you call a pig that does karate? A pork chop! (laughs)<p class=message>(laughs) That's funny! I have one too. What do you call an elf who sings? A wrapper! (laughs)<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's a good one! Wait, do you hear that? It sounds like someone is crying for help.<p class=message>Let's hurry! I'll climb up this tree and scout from above while you investigate. Stay safe!<p class="message sent">You too. This looks like a trap. I'm going to need your help, elf.<p class=message>On my way! Let's show these kidnappers what we're made of!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8367e078-8fe3-4d37-a94e-1873fcf9619f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
