Have you ever been before?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, many times! It's a beautiful city with so much to see and do. Have you planned your itinerary?<p class=message>I have a few places in mind, like the Fushimi Inari Shrine and Nijo Castle. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class="message sent">Well, there's the Kiyomizu-dera Temple and the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, both very popular tourist spots. And if you have time, I highly recommend visiting the Gion District for some traditional Japanese culture.<p class=message>That all sounds amazing! I'm really excited now. By the way, do you have any favorite foods in Kyoto?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love Kyoto-style sushi, which is made with vinegar rice and often topped with fresh seafood. And don't forget to try Yudofu, which is a type of tofu hot pot – it's perfect for cold days.<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestions. I'm definitely going to try those out. So, have you been driving a taxi here for long?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been driving for about 10 years now. It's a good job and I meet lots of interesting people like you!<p class=message>That's great to hear. I think this trip will be the highlight of my Japan vacation. We're almost there now, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, we're getting close. Just a few more minutes and we'll be in the heart of the city. Do you need any help with directions or finding your hotel?<p class=message>No, I think I have everything under control. Thanks for your help and for the great conversation!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Have a fantastic time in Kyoto – I'm sure you'll love it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=41eec516-2bb1-4623-a441-8e741c6de8b8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
