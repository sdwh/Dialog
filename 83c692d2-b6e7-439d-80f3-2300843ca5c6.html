How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, thank you. I'm just here for a few days and I'm not quite sure where to start. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Well, Darwin has some great parks and museums, so those are always worth checking out. Kakadu National Park is also a must-visit if you have time.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting, but how do I get there?<p class=message>We offer day tours to Kakadu and Litchfield National Park, or you can rent a car and do a self-drive tour. It's about a three-hour drive from here.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not sure if I want to drive myself, but a day tour could be fun. What else can I do in Darwin?<p class=message>You could take a sunset cruise on the harbor, visit the Mindil Beach Sunset Market, or even try some crocodile spotting. It really depends on what you're interested in.<p class="message sent">Crocodile spotting?! That sounds like an adventure! Can you give me more information about that?<p class=message>Sure, there are some great tours that take you out to see the crocs in the wild. You'll be able to see them up close and learn more about them from your guide.<p class="message sent">I think I will definitely add that to my itinerary! Do you have any recommendations for good restaurants in the area?<p class=message>Absolutely. There are lots of great places to eat in Darwin. Some of my favorites are Hanuman, Chow, and Pee Wee's at the Point.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your help! I'm excited to explore Darwin now.<p class=message>No problem, have a great trip! And if you need any more advice or information, come back and see me anytime.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=83c4abf0-8709-4f96-9110-d609940429b1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
