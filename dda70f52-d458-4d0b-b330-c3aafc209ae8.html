How did you come up with this?<p class=message>It's all about the color coordination and size of the products. We want to create an organized and visually appealing display for our customers.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Have you considered using different shapes or heights to add interest?<p class=message>Yes, we've experimented with different shapes and heights in the past, but it didn't seem to have much of an impact on sales.<p class="message sent">Interesting. How about signage and labeling? Do you find that it helps customers make a decision?<p class=message>Absolutely. Accurate and clear labeling is essential for customers to easily identify the products they're looking for. We also use signage to highlight promotions and special deals.<p class="message sent">I see you also have an end cap display. Do you find that it drives more sales?<p class=message>Definitely. The end cap display is a great way to showcase a featured product or a seasonal item. It catches the customer's attention as soon as they enter the aisle.<p class="message sent">I absolutely agree. Well, thank you for your insights. You've been very helpful.<p class=message>No problem! Let me know if you have any other questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dda5bb0a-e251-4c90-85f3-2a2cb0279bbf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
