I'm a ticket sales representative here at the airport. How's business going for you?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yep, I'm selling some rad travel packages for the adventurous souls out there. Business has been great lately. I think people are just itching to go out and explore.<p class=message>That's awesome to hear. Have you thought about partnering with us to offer travel packages as add-ons to our airline tickets?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! That's exactly what I'm here for. I'm looking to expand my customer base by tapping into the airport market. Do you have any advice on how I can better market my products to your passengers?<p class=message>Well, I think the key is to emphasize convenience. Most people are looking for hassle-free travel experiences, and your packages could offer just that. Don't forget to highlight any discounts or promotions you have going on too.<p class="message sent">That's a great point. I'll definitely make sure to showcase the convenience aspect. And don't worry, I have some awesome deals going on right now.<p class=message>Perfect! I'm sure our passengers would love to hear that. I'll make sure to spread the word amongst my colleagues here at the airport.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate that! Oh, and one more thing - do you have any favorite travel destinations?<p class=message>Hmm, that's a tough one. I'd have to say Japan. I went there last year and the culture totally blew me away.<p class="message sent">I've always wanted to go to Japan! Maybe you can give me some tips for my next package deal.<p class=message>Absolutely! Anytime you need some insider tips, just come find me. I'm always happy to chat about travel.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ece0bb99-9c24-4447-a9a3-2eebb3a4e09c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
