I'm great! I'm always happy when we go on our walk together.<p class=message>Me too. What's new in school lately?<p class="message sent">We just learned about the planets, and did a project on the solar system.<p class=message>That's interesting. What is your favorite planet?<p class="message sent">I really like Jupiter because it has a lot of moons and a big red spot.<p class=message>That's a good choice. Did you know that Jupiter is actually the biggest planet in our solar system?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I learned that in class.<p class=message>Do you want to see if we can spot Jupiter in the sky tonight after dinner?<p class="message sent">Yes, that sounds like a lot of fun!<p class=message>Excellent, and maybe we can bring some binoculars to get a better view of it.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Can we also bring cupcakes to celebrate finding Jupiter?<p class=message>Sure, we can bake some together later. By the way, did you know that your grandma and I used to stargaze a lot when we were younger?<p class="message sent">Really? I didn't know that. Did you discover any new planets?<p class=message>Unfortunately, no. But we did discover some cool constellations and saw a few shooting stars.<p class="message sent">I hope one day I can see a shooting star too. It's one of my dreams!<p class=message>It can happen, especially when we least expect it. Dreams do come true sometimes!<p class="message sent">Thanks for making me smile, grandpa. Walking with you always cheers me up.<p class=message>Anytime, grandson. I enjoy spending time with you too. Let's go and enjoy the sunshine!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5b942e15-0df5-4282-a336-1fd136cd8a17.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
