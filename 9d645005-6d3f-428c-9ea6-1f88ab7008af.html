Do you know the best places to get them in this market?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm B, a local guide. Sure thing, let me show you around. You won't be disappointed.<p class=message>Wow, so many different kinds of fish and shellfish! Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">How about the sardines? It's one of the local specialties and it's in season now. Or maybe the fresh squid? It's perfect for grilling.<p class=message>Sounds great! How do you usually prepare them in your cuisine?<p class="message sent">Our local cuisine has a dish called "sardines yokan," which is made by simmering the sardines with soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. For squid, we usually prepare it with ginger and vinegar.<p class=message>Interesting! How do you typically cook it?<p class="message sent">For sardines, we usually cook them in a pan, but you can also try grilling them. And for squid, we suggest grilling it as well.<p class=message>Got it. Can I try cooking them with you? I would love to learn more about local cooking techniques.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We can go to my friend's restaurant nearby and have a cooking class together.<p class=message>That sounds wonderful! Let's go!<p class="message sent">Great! I'll introduce you to my friend and we can start our lesson.<p class="message sent">A, great job on your cooking! You're a natural!<p class=message>Thank you!
