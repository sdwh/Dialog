Welcome to our restaurant, we are happy to have you here today.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for having me! I am really excited to experience traditional Japanese cuisine.<p class=message>You're in the right place! Would you like to try one of our set menus or order a la carte?<p class="message sent">I think I'll go with one of your set menus. Can you recommend something that goes well with tea?<p class=message>Sure, our cha-kaiseki set menu is perfect for pairing with tea. And speaking of tea, would you like a matcha or sencha to go with your meal?<p class="message sent">Definitely matcha, please. And since we're on the topic of tea, would you happen to have any tea ceremonies going on today?<p class=message>Actually, we do! We have a tea ceremony scheduled at our garden terrace later in the afternoon. Would you like to join?<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing, count me in. By the way, have you tried the tea ceremony before?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's a beautiful and serene experience.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to try it myself. So, tell me, is there any special etiquette I should know about when drinking tea during the ceremony?<p class=message>Yes, there are a few things to keep in mind. For example, you must bow slightly when receiving or presenting the tea, and it's considered impolite to slurp the tea loudly.<p class="message sent">Got it, I'll try my best to remember those. By the way, this food is amazing! What is this dish?<p class=message>That's our signature dish, something we're really proud of. It's a grilled fish called yaki-sakana, seasoned with our secret blend of spices.<p class="message sent">That explains why it tastes so good. I'll have to ask for the recipe before I leave!<p class=message>I'm afraid I can't give away our secret recipe, but I can certainly recommend some cooking classes and workshops for you to attend!<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea, I would love to learn more about Japanese cuisine. Thank you so much for the recommendation.<p class=message>No problem at all, it's our pleasure to share our culture with you. I'll go ahead and check on your tea and food, feel free to let me know if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your hospitality, A. This has been a wonderful experience so far.<p class=message>You're welcome, B. It's been a pleasure serving you today. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7ed12f56-5841-47d8-9602-e8e1c182c0a2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
