It's a beautiful temple, and visitors from all over the world come to see it. Do you know what it looks like?<p class=message>I have seen some pictures online. It looks like a white lotus flower, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct. And did you know that it's one of the most visited religious sites in the world?<p class=message>No, I didn't. That's quite interesting. I also want to try authentic Indian food. Can you recommend some good restaurants?<p class="message sent">Yes, there are many great places to eat in Delhi. If you're looking for street food, I'd recommend Chandni Chowk. And for fancy dining, Bukhara and Indian Accent are good options.<p class=message>Thank you for the recommendations.

When he finally decided to travel by plane, he was so nervous that he vomited all over my car. It was quite an interesting ride!<p class=message>That's quite a funny story! It's great to hear that you have such a positive attitude towards your job. Thank you for sharing that with me.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! We're almost at your destination now.
