Can you tell us a bit about yourself?<p class="message sent">Of course, my name is Tom and I'm a professional juggler. I've been performing for over ten years now.<p class=message>Wow, that's really impressive. How did you first get into juggling?<p class="message sent">Well, I actually started learning when I was in college. My roommate was a juggler and he taught me a few tricks. I just fell in love with it and decided to pursue it as a career.<p class=message>That's really cool. Do you have any unique or unusual juggling props that you use in your performances?<p class="message sent">Definitely. One of my favorites is a set of flaming torches. It always gets a great reaction from the crowd.<p class=message>(laughs) I can imagine! Have you ever had any mishaps or accidents during a performance?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, more times than I care to admit. I've dropped props, missed catches, and even set my hair on fire once. But that's all part of the excitement.<p class=message>(laughs) Sounds like you have a good sense of humor about it all. So, what's next for you in your juggling career?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to push myself. I'm currently working on a routine that involves juggling while on a unicycle. It's been a steep learning curve, but I'm getting there.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. We can't wait to see it. Thanks for chatting with us today and sharing a bit about your juggling career.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=41aeca01-3812-470b-bdcf-cd82be5d065e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
