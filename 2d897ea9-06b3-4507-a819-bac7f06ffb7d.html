How about you?<p class=message>Same here, thank goodness for air conditioning. So, have you lived in New York long?<p class="message sent">Yeah, my whole life. It's a great place to be a cab driver, always something interesting going on.<p class=message>That's for sure. I've only visited a few times and each time there's been something totally different going on.<p class="message sent">Yeah, sometimes it can be overwhelming, but it keeps things exciting, you know?<p class=message>Definitely. So, do you have any favorite spots in the city?<p class="message sent">My favorite is probably Coney Island. It's a little cheesy, but it's so much fun.<p class=message>That sounds like a blast. I've always wanted to check it out.<p class="message sent">You should definitely go. Just be prepared for the crowds and the noise.<p class=message>Good to know. What's the craziest thing you've ever seen in the city?<p class="message sent">Oh man, that's a tough one. I've seen a lot of crazy stuff over the years. Probably the time I saw a guy walking a pet chicken down the street.<p class=message>(laughs) No way. Only in New York, right?<p class="message sent">Exactly. So, what brings you to the city today?<p class=message>Just visiting some friends and doing some sightseeing. I've got a list of places I want to hit up.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a fun time. If you need any recommendations, just let me know. I've got plenty of suggestions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2d87ba60-38c5-48c4-b7fb-fb9df774411d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
