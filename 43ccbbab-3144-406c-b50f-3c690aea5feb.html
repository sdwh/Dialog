Are you ready to shoot our first scene for today?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. And please, call me by my name.<p class=message>Alright, boss. Oops, I mean, Ian.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's better. So, have you memorized your lines already?<p class=message>Yes, I have. But I hope I won't forget them once the camera starts rolling.<p class="message sent">You won't. And even if you do, we can always do another take.<p class=message>(smiling) That's reassuring. By the way, I noticed that the weather is nice today. Do you think we'll be able to finish our target scenes for the day?<p class="message sent">(checking his watch) Hmm, we have a tight schedule but I think we can make it. The sun is up and we should make use of the natural light as much as possible.<p class=message>I agree. Talking about lights, I noticed that some of them are not turned on yet. Should I call on the lighting team?<p class="message sent">Yes, please do. We need to start ASAP.<p class=message>Alright. (A walks away and makes a call)<p class="message sent">(checking the camera) You know what, Ian? You look great in your costume. Have you lost weight?<p class=message>(blushes) Thanks, boss. Yes, I did. I've been hitting the gym every day for the past month.<p class="message sent">Well, it shows. Your character is a hero, after all. You need to look tough and fit.<p class=message>(jokingly flexing his muscles) Of course! (laughs)<p class="message sent">(stops looking at the camera and turns to A) Okay, I think we're ready to roll. Remember, Ian, just relax and be your character. You got this!<p class=message>Got it, boss! (takes a deep breath and gets into character)<p class="message sent">(smiling and giving a thumbs-up) Alright, action!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=43cbde88-721a-490e-b425-62eb678175c9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
