I love driving on days like this. So, are you visiting Canberra for work or vacation?<p class=message>I'm going for a quick vacation, just some sightseeing and relaxation.<p class="message sent">Great! Don't miss out on the Australian War Memorial and the National Gallery of Australia. They're the best places to visit in Canberra.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendations! I'll definitely check them out. By the way, do you have any favorite music to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">I actually do! My favorite song to listen to while driving is "Born to Run" by Bruce Springsteen. What's yours?<p class=message>I love listening to "Hotel California" by the Eagles. It's a classic!<p class="message sent">Nice choice! It's always great to listen to classic rock on road trips. I also love to sing along to it too.<p class=message>Haha, me too! Singing along is half the fun of road trips. Do you have any funny passenger stories to share?<p class="message sent">Oh, you wouldn't believe some of the stories I have. I once had a passenger who tried to convince me that they were a secret agent on a top-secret mission!<p class=message>No way! That's hilarious. Did you believe them?<p class="message sent">Of course not! But it was still funny. I've met all kinds of interesting people on the job.<p class=message>I bet. Have you ever taken a really long road trip before?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. Last year, I took a month-long road trip across Australia. It was such an adventure!<p class=message>Wow, that must have been amazing. I've always wanted to do a road trip like that.<p class="message sent">It was definitely worth it. There are so many beautiful places to see in Australia.<p class=message>I completely agree. We've arrived at my hotel now. Thanks for the great conversation and the safe trip!<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Have a great vacation and enjoy your stay in Canberra!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6ff2de6a-224a-445d-ba1b-f6f2273b26e7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
