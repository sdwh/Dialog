How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey, A. Not bad. How about you?<p class=message>Good, thanks. So, we're here to talk about improving the company's network security, right?<p class="message sent">Yup, that's correct.<p class=message>Well, I've noticed that some employees don't seem to take their passwords seriously.<p class="message sent">That's definitely an issue. Maybe we could introduce a password policy that requires them to be a bit more complex?<p class=message>Agreed. And another thing I've seen is people leaving their computers unlocked when they step away from their desks.<p class="message sent">Oh no, that's a big security risk. Maybe we could have a reminder pop up after a certain amount of time reminding people to lock their screens?<p class=message>That's a great idea. How about phishing attacks? Have we had any incidents of employees falling for those?<p class="message sent">A few, unfortunately. I think we should organize some training sessions to teach people how to recognize and avoid them.<p class=message>Yes, training sessions are definitely necessary. And what about software updates? Are employees keeping their devices up-to-date?<p class="message sent">To be honest, I'm not sure. Maybe we should implement an automated system that reminds them to update their software?<p class=message>Good idea. And lastly, what measures do we currently have in place for external attacks?<p class="message sent">We have firewalls and antivirus software, but I think we should consider hiring a third-party security firm to perform regular penetration tests.<p class=message>That's a great suggestion. Overall, it sounds like there's a lot we can do to improve our network security.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Let's put together a plan of action and get to work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b1124f3b-7bea-4b9a-bcb9-9b5a442b29dd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
