Have you made any progress on the social media website we're developing?<p class="message sent message-content">Hey A! Yeah, I've been working on the backend functionality. I've set up the database and some basic APIs.<p class="message received message-content">That's great! I've been working on the frontend design. I think I've come up with a cool layout for the user profiles.<p class="message sent message-content">Nice! I saw your design mockup earlier and it looked really sleek. Have you had any trouble integrating it with the backend?<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, there were a few issues with some of the user data not displaying correctly, but I managed to fix it with some troubleshooting.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds like you're on top of things. By the way, have you considered implementing a chat feature?<p class="message received message-content">Actually, I was just thinking about that. Do you have any ideas on how we could integrate it into the site?<p class="message sent message-content">I was thinking of using a third-party library to handle chat functionality. I'll send over some links for you to check out.<p class="message received message-content">Alright, thanks! By the way, have you tried out that new coffee shop that just opened up down the street?<p class="message sent message-content">No, I haven't had a chance to check it out yet. Is it any good?<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, I went there yesterday and the coffee was amazing. Plus, they have free Wi-Fi, so it's a great spot to work on coding projects.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds like we'll have to go there together sometime. Coffee and coding, my two favorite things!<p class="message received message-content">Haha, definitely! Maybe we can take a break from coding and challenge each other to a game of table tennis later.<p class="message sent message-content">You're on! But be warned, I'm a bit of a pro at ping pong.<p class="message received message-content">We'll see about that. I'll bring my A-game!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=00a1b0c7-fded-4d5f-8a94-00316983330f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
