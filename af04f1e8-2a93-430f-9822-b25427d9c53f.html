What brings you here today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm just here to do some fruit picking. I thought it would be fun.<p class=message>Ah, yes. It's a great activity for the family. What fruit are you interested in picking today?<p class="message sent">I was hoping to pick some peaches and apricots. They're my favorite.<p class=message>Good choice! We have plenty of those in season right now. Have you done fruit picking before?<p class="message sent">No, this is my first time. I'm excited to learn.<p class=message>Well, it's easy. Just hold the fruit gently and twist it until it comes off the tree. Try to avoid damaging the branches.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. Do you have any tips for finding the sweetest fruit?<p class=message>Yes, look for the ones that are fully ripened - they'll come off the tree easily - and check the color. A nice blush or bright color means they'll be sweet.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tips. How long have you been in the fruit farming business?<p class=message>Oh, my family has been doing this for generations. It's a labor of love, but we enjoy it.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. I bet it's hard work though.<p class=message>It can be, but we're used to it. Plus, it's a great way to stay in shape!<p class="message sent">I bet. So, what do you do with all the fruit you pick?<p class=message>We sell it at the local farmer's market and to local businesses. We also make jams and other yummy treats with it.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. Do you have any favorite recipes?<p class=message>Yes, my grandma's peach cobbler recipe is to die for. Maybe I can give you a copy.<p class="message sent">That would be awesome. Thanks for your hospitality and for teaching me about fruit picking.<p class=message>No problem, it's our pleasure to share our knowledge with visitors. Have fun picking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=af03a838-2d6c-4ced-8e48-ed31e78b5894.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
