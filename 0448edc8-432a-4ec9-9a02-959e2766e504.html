No, I've never heard of it. What is it?<p class=message>Basically, it's a standard for data backup and recovery procedures to ensure data security for organizations. Pretty important stuff.<p class="message sent">Ah, okay. So why are we talking about it?<p class=message>Well, we need to implement it in our company. You know, to make sure our data is always secure.<p class="message sent">Gotcha. So what kind of backups are we talking about here?<p class=message>Full backups, incremental backups, differential backups... you name it, we're doing it.<p class="message sent">Wow. That's a lot of backups. But why do we need so many?<p class=message>Well, it's all about minimizing data loss in case something goes wrong. You never know when disaster might strike!<p class="message sent">True. And what about recovery? How would we recover our data in case of a disaster?<p class=message>We've got a whole process for that. We'll go through our disaster recovery plan and restore our data from backups. Piece of cake!<p class="message sent">(laughs) I hope so! But are there any risks involved in this process?<p class=message>Of course, there always are. But that's why ISO 27001 Backup standards exist - to help us minimize those risks.<p class="message sent">Right, that makes sense. So how long does it usually take to implement ISO 27001 Backup?<p class=message>It really depends on our company's specific needs and requirements. But it could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.<p class="message sent">Okay. And who would handle the implementation?<p class=message>Our IT team would be responsible for that. They'll make sure everything is set up according to the ISO standards.<p class="message sent">Got it. Well, it sounds like a lot of work, but definitely worth it in the long run.<p class=message>Absolutely. Our data is too important not to protect.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0446bf38-d588-42ef-a911-dd77aa13be06.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
