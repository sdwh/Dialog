I would like to go to the Willis Tower, please.<p class=message>Alright, that's a popular destination. Just a heads up, we might encounter some heavy traffic on our way there.<p class="message sent">No problem. By the way, can you explain to me the traffic rules we need to follow to get there safely?<p class=message>Sure thing. First, always wear your seatbelt. It's a state law here.<p class="message sent">Got it. What about the speed limit?<p class=message>The speed limit in most city areas is 30 mph (48 km/h). But always watch out for signs indicating a lower speed limit.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. And what about turning right on red?<p class=message>That's allowed in Illinois unless posted otherwise. But, of course, always double-check before making a right turn on red.<p class="message sent">I see. And how about pedestrians?<p class=message>You need to yield to them at all times, except at places where the pedestrian has a red light. Also, be alert for pedestrians crossing the street unexpectedly.<p class="message sent">Okay, I will keep that in mind. Thanks for your advice! By the way, the Willis Tower has a parking lot, right?<p class=message>Yes, it does. But parking might be expensive, especially during peak hours, so be prepared for that.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the heads up, I will keep that in mind. You're a very helpful driver!<p class=message>It's my pleasure to assist you, sir. Do you have any other questions?<p class="message sent">No, that's all for now. Thank you again for the explanation.<p class=message>You're welcome! I hope you enjoy your visit to the Willis Tower. Enjoy your stay in Chicago!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=57d1684a-125f-4f61-9ddf-3cf7b7c41c3b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
