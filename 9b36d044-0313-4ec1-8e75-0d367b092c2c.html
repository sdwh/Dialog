Welcome to our tea house in Shanghai. What can we do for you?<p class="message sent">Good morning! We are looking for some traditional Chinese pastries and some nice tea to go with it. Can you suggest something?<p class=message>Sure! How about some freshly baked egg tarts and some green tea? It's a classic combination.<p class="message sent">That sounds great, but could you tell us a little about the tea? Is it light or strong?<p class=message>Our green tea has a light flavor and a slightly grassy taste, perfect for pairing with yummy pastries.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! What other kinds of tea do you have?<p class=message>We have a wide variety, ranging from black tea to pu'er tea. Would you like to try something different?<p class="message sent">Yes, can you recommend a tea that is good for digestion?<p class=message>Our jasmine tea is known for its digestion benefits. It's also a light floral tea that is perfect for relaxing.<p class="message sent">That sounds great too! So, can you teach us how to prepare the tea properly?<p class=message>Of course! Let me show you how to brew the tea and steep it for the right amount of time.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your help, it's great to learn about Chinese tea culture.<p class=message>You're welcome! We take pride in our tea and pastries, and it's always a pleasure sharing our knowledge with customers.<p class="message sent">The egg tart is amazing!

It's one of our most popular pastries.<p class="message sent">You're definitely turning us into tea and pastry lovers. We can't wait to come back and try more.<p class=message>We're so glad to hear that. We hope to see you again soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9b3670d0-1af8-4b03-94c0-5497c16f571f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
