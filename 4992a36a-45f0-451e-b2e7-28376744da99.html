Have you had any experience with software development before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, our company is currently working on developing a new application, and I was wondering if you could lend a hand.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'd be happy to help. What kind of application are we talking about here?<p class=message>It's a social media platform that we're hoping to launch later this year. We're still in the beginning stages of development, but we need all the help we can get.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting! What kind of skills are you looking for specifically?<p class=message>We need someone who has experience in coding and developing mobile applications. Do you have any experience with those?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I've worked on a few mobile applications in the past and I'm pretty familiar with coding.<p class=message>Great. What programming languages are you familiar with?<p class="message sent">I'm experienced in Java and Ruby on Rails, but I'm also comfortable with HTML and CSS.<p class=message>That's perfect. We're looking for someone who is versatile and can work with various programming languages. What's your availability like?<p class="message sent">I'm pretty flexible. I can work weekends and evenings if need be.<p class=message>Excellent. We're hoping to have a working prototype ready by the end of the month. Do you think you could help us meet that deadline?<p class="message sent">I can definitely give it my best shot. Would you like me to start working on the project now?<p class=message>Yes, that would be great. I'll send you the details and we can touch base later this week to discuss your progress.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I'm excited to get started!<p class=message>Me too. Thanks for helping us out.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It's always fun to work on a new project.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=49928bdd-00b2-4eee-98b5-e1d8181a5093.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
