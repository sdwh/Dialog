We already have a lot of data from the sensors, which can be processed using machine learning algorithms to enhance the performance of the system.<p class=message>I agree. But we need to ensure that we have high-quality data before feeding it into our models. Have you looked into the image recognition part yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, we are using deep learning models to classify objects and detect pedestrians. We are testing different architectures and optimizing the hyperparameters.<p class=message>That sounds promising. But what about the control system? How can machine learning help us in decision-making under complex and uncertain situations?<p class="message sent">We are experimenting with reinforcement learning. Our agents learn through trial and error, so they can improve the actions they take based on the rewards or penalties they receive.<p class=message>Interesting. Speaking of rewards, did you hear about that Tesla car that mistakenly followed a police car for miles? What can we do to avoid such mistakes?<p class="message sent">We need to add more constraints to our models to prevent false positives. For example, we can add rules to avoid following emergency vehicles unless there are clear indications that it's safe to do so.<p class=message>That makes sense. By the way, have you seen the latest video of that self-driving car in San Francisco almost hitting the pedestrian?<p class="message sent">Yes, that was alarming. We need to work on improving the accuracy and speed of our object detection models to avoid such incidents.<p class=message>Absolutely. But we also need to remember that safety is our top priority, and we should test and validate our system thoroughly before deploying it on the roads.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more, A. We should always keep in mind that we are not just building a product, but we are also shaping the future of transportation.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b2b8468c-88ad-4e11-81a7-22a7ce555da8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
