How was your day today?<p class="message sent">It was great, Boss A. Today, I had the chance to observe and learn how to prepare some mouth-watering delicacies of Fukuoka.<p class=message>Wow, that's fantastic! I'm so happy that you are enjoying the training. What did you learn today?<p class="message sent">I learned how to make a perfect bowl of Ramen, grill fish to perfection, and make Yakitori skewers. It was quite interesting to learn about new ingredients and preparation techniques.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! I'm sure our customers will be delighted to taste these new dishes. Did you happen to cause any kitchen accidents today?<p class="message sent">(chuckles) Not yet, Boss A. But, you never know when a slippery fish might jump off the chopping board!<p class=message>(laughs) That's true! Have you tried any local restaurants in Fukuoka?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I visited a few Izakayas and had some amazing local dishes. My favorite was the Hakata Motsunabe. It's a hotpot made with offal and vegetables. It's definitely an acquired taste, but I loved it!<p class=message>Hmm, I'm not sure if I'm brave enough to try that. How about some local snacks and desserts? Have you tried any of those?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I had some amazing Matcha soft serve ice cream and some sweet potato chips. They were delicious.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds amazing. Ok, Chef B, let's get back to work. We have a new dish to start working on. It's a must-try in Fukuoka - the Takoyaki balls.<p class="message sent">Alright, Boss A. Let's get to it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fba64006-899e-4769-b9f6-204fa433411d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
