How's business today?<p class="message sent">Hey A! It's been great. People can't get enough of our sweet soups and dumplings.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear. I'm really glad we decided to partner up.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's been a dream of mine to open up a shop like this in Chinatown.<p class=message>Well, I'm glad I could help make that dream a reality. So, what's the most popular item on the menu this week?<p class="message sent">Definitely our mango sago pomelo dessert. It's been selling like crazy.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds delicious. I haven't had that in ages. Maybe I'll have to treat myself to a bowl later.<p class="message sent">I highly recommend it. And as for our dumplings, the shrimp ones have been a big hit.<p class=message>Can't go wrong with shrimp dumplings! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.<p class="message sent">You should try some of our new menu items too. We just added a crispy eggplant dish and a spicy beef noodle soup.<p class=message>Mmm, those sound tempting. I'll definitely have to give them a try.<p class="message sent">So, how about you? How's the tea side of things going?<p class=message>It's been steady. Our classic Hong Kong-style milk tea is always a popular choice. And we've been getting some good feedback on our bubble tea options too.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I think I might grab one on my break.<p class=message>Of course! We're here to support each other, after all.<p class="message sent">You got that right. Here's to many more successful days like today!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a87b643f-c1f5-4104-b60f-33452c9c38df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
