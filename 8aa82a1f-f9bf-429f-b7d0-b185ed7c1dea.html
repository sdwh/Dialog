Thank you for coming in today for the interview. Let's start by telling me a little bit about yourself.<p class=message>Hi! I'm excited to be here. Well, I have a degree in hospitality management and I've previously worked as a receptionist at a hotel for two years.<p class="message sent">That's great. Can you tell me about your experience with reservations specifically?<p class=message>Of course. At my previous job, I was responsible for handling all the reservations for the hotel. I assisted with phone and online bookings and ensured that guest preferences were noted and met.<p class="message sent">That's excellent. And how do you handle difficult situations with customers or reservations?<p class=message>I always make sure to listen to the customer's concerns patiently and offer practical solutions. I also try to find a way to make up for any inconvenience that the customer may have faced.<p class="message sent">Very impressive. So, what do you think differentiates you from other candidates applying for this role?<p class=message>I believe my experience as a receptionist and my hospitality management background, combined with my ability to handle reservations with ease, sets me apart from others.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. Alright, last question for you. If you could describe yourself in three words, what would they be?<p class=message>I would say I'm adaptable, attentive, and personable.<p class="message sent">Wonderful. Thank you for your time today. We'll be in touch soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8aa69336-d2dc-4c7a-8fe9-fdfadb5c3bd7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
