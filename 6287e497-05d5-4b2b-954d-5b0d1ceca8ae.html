Have you considered using the observer pattern?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was thinking more along the lines of the factory method pattern.<p class=message>Interesting choice. Have you thought about combining the two patterns to create something even better?<p class="message sent">Hm, that could work. Do you think it would be overcomplicating things?<p class=message>Not necessarily. It could actually simplify the code in the long run.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'm sold. Let's give it a shot.<p class=message>Great! And while we're at it, have you heard of the modularization technique?<p class="message sent">Can't say I have. What is it?<p class=message>Essentially, it's dividing a system into smaller, more manageable components. It can improve scalability and maintainability.<p class="message sent">That sounds like something we should definitely keep in mind as we continue developing this system.<p class=message>Definitely. And speaking of scalability, have you seen the new cloud computing options that just came out?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had a chance to check them out yet. Are they any good?<p class=message>They look promising. We could potentially save a lot of time and money by utilizing them in our system architecture.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. Thanks for keeping me updated.<p class=message>No problem. Collaboration is key when it comes to designing and implementing software systems.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's great to bounce ideas off each other and come up with the best solution possible.<p class=message>Well said. Looking forward to seeing how our combined design efforts turn out in the end.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=628541f1-a9f7-46cb-9623-4592b3630bac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
