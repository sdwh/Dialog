May I start you off with some drinks?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Sure, I'll have a glass of Soju. How about you?<p class=message>I'll go with some Makgeolli. By the way, have you tried our Korean BBQ yet?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, it's our specialty! Our customers love it.<p class=message>I'm so excited to prepare it for them tonight. Can you get the grill ready while I prepare the meat?<p class="message sent">Of course! And I'll assist you in seasoning the meat. How about we add some spicy gochujang sauce to give it a little kick?<p class=message>Great idea! And let's also top it with some sesame seeds for that authentic Korean touch.<p class="message sent">Yum, my mouth is watering already. Oh, and don't forget to prepare the side dishes too.<p class=message>Right, we have to make sure we have enough kimchi, pickled vegetables, and rice ready for our guests.<p class="message sent">Speaking of rice, did you know that Koreans traditionally use metal chopsticks and a spoon to eat their meals?<p class=message>Really? I didn't know that. I've always used wooden chopsticks.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's believed that the metal chopsticks enhance the taste of the food. But don't worry, our guests can use whatever utensils they prefer.<p class=message>That's good to know. Do you have any recommendations for our first-timers?<p class="message sent">I'd say they should definitely try our bibimbap or bulgogi dishes. They're both classic Korean dishes that are sure to please.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! Okay, let's get to work and give our guests an unforgettable Korean dining experience.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e3511163-86b3-4098-8822-fc1b74398a52.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
