It's like a fancy way of saying how you develop and manage your software.<p class="message sent">No way! That sounds so technical and complicated. Is it even fun to talk about?<p class=message>Yeah, it does sound serious, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty cool. You get to ensure that your software is secure and protected from hackers.<p class="message sent">That's neat, but I bet it's a lot of work.<p class=message>It is at first, but once you have your SDLC plan set up, it's smooth sailing from there.<p class="message sent">So, what are the steps in the SDLC?<p class=message>Well, there's planning, designing, implementing, testing, and reviewing. It's like a big cycle that repeats itself every time you develop new software.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. So, how long does it usually take to complete the SDLC?<p class=message>It varies, but it can take anywhere from a few months to a year. It all depends on the complexity of the software and the resources you have.<p class="message sent">Wow, I had no idea that developing software was such a tedious process.<p class=message>It can be, but it's worth it in the end when you have a secure and protected system. Plus, you get the satisfaction of knowing that you're keeping your users safe.<p class="message sent">I never thought about it like that. Maybe I should look into ISO 27001 SDLC for my next project.<p class=message>Definitely! Trust me, once you start, you won't be able to stop talking about it. It's like a secret club for developers who want the best for their users.<p class="message sent">Haha, sounds like a party. Thanks for enlightening me on ISO 27001 SDLC. I can't wait to start my own cycle.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99cbb058-289b-41ea-a58e-f6ae9aef9560.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
