How's everything going with the cashiers?<p class="message sent">Fine so far, A. No unusual transactions, but have you heard about the recent theft cases in other supermarkets around the city?<p class=message>No, tell me more about it.<p class="message sent">Well, apparently, there have been some cases of people surreptitiously taking advantage of the self-checkout machines by not scanning certain items.<p class=message>Really? That's pretty cunning.<p class="message sent">Yes, and it's not easy to catch them. We need to keep an eye on any suspicious behavior.<p class=message>Absolutely. We have to be vigilant and make sure that doesn't happen here.<p class="message sent">Another thing: customers sometimes put high-priced items in their shopping bags to avoid setting off the security alarm.<p class=message>That's sneaky, too. We'd better be careful then.<p class="message sent">Yes, we have to remember to check their shopping bags before they leave.<p class=message>By the way, how's your family doing, B?<p class="message sent">They're doing fine, thank you for asking. My wife is preparing for our daughter's birthday party this weekend.<p class=message>That sounds fun. How old is your daughter turning?<p class="message sent">She's turning ten. It's a big milestone for her.<p class=message>I'm sure she'll have a great time. Tell her I said happy birthday.<p class="message sent">I will, thank you!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bbf78409-4736-487f-a6a7-3ef20c644820.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
