How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hello, A. I am feeling a little better than yesterday.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Have you been practicing the breathing exercises I showed you?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They really help me relax and breathe better.<p class=message>That's wonderful. You know, I was thinking of bringing in some board games for us to play during your downtime. Do you like playing board games?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. That sounds like a lot of fun.<p class=message>Awesome! I'll bring in a few options and we can choose which one to play.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. So, how long have you been a nurse?<p class=message>I have been a nurse for 10 years now. What about you? What do you do for a living?<p class="message sent">I work in finance. It can be quite stressful at times, but I enjoy the work.<p class=message>I can imagine. At least with nursing, I get to help people and make a difference in their lives.<p class="message sent">That's definitely rewarding work. So, have you seen any good movies lately?<p class=message>Oh, I watched the new comedy that just came out. It was really funny. Have you seen any movies lately?<p class="message sent">Not recently, but I've been wanting to watch that new action movie that just came out.<p class=message>Ah, I've heard good things about that one. Maybe we can watch it together once you're feeling better.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. Thank you for being such a wonderful nurse, A. You're making my stay here much easier.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, B. I'm glad I can help. Let's get you feeling better soon so you can get back to your life outside of the hospital.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=63e41f88-ee3b-4211-86ae-60561f402d81.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
