Can you break it down for me?<p class=message>Sure. Basically, it's a way to keep data secure by using complex algorithms to encrypt and decrypt messages.<p class="message sent">Got it. That's important for businesses, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. Especially for those that deal with sensitive data like financial information or personal records.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. So, what's the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?<p class=message>Well, symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses different keys for each.<p class="message sent">Interesting. And which one is more secure?<p class=message>Asymmetric encryption is generally considered more secure because it's harder to crack without knowledge of both keys.<p class="message sent">I see. So what are some common encryption algorithms used in ISO 27001?<p class=message>Some popular ones include AES, Blowfish, and RSA.<p class="message sent">Those sound fancy. Can you explain them briefly?<p class=message>AES is a symmetric algorithm that's commonly used for encrypting files, while Blowfish is also symmetric but is known for its speed. RSA, on the other hand, is an asymmetric algorithm often used for secure online communication like email.<p class="message sent">Gotcha. Thanks for explaining all of that to me, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. It's important to stay informed about data security, even if it can be a bit overwhelming at times.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'll have to keep researching it. Thanks again, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=961d987c-065f-4b6f-b3e4-969be9316e45.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
