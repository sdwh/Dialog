Can I help you find any books?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Yes please, I'm looking for books on history and culture for my class.<p class=message>Great! What age group do you teach?<p class="message sent">Middle school students, ages 12-14.<p class=message>Alright, we have a wide range of books on world history and cultural practices. Have you heard of the book "Guns, Germs, and Steel" by Jared Diamond?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! That sounds like a good one for my older students.<p class=message>Definitely! It covers the rise and fall of civilizations and how geography and environmental factors play a role.<p class="message sent">Interesting. What about for my younger students?<p class=message>For them, we have "The Story of the World" by Susan Wise Bauer. It's a series of books that covers world history in a way that's easy to understand and fun for kids.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! Any other suggestions?<p class=message>Sure! For cultural practices, you might want to check out "Cultures of the World" series. It has books on different countries and their customs, food, clothing, and traditions.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. That's useful for my students to learn about different cultures and broaden their perspectives.<p class=message>Yes, it's important for them to understand and appreciate diversity. We also have some fiction books set in different cultures, like "The Joy Luck Club" by Amy Tan or "The Kite Runner" by Khaled Hosseini.<p class="message sent">Those are two excellent suggestions. I've read them myself and enjoyed them.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that! Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class="message sent">No, thank you. You've been very helpful. I'll take these books to check out now.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. Have a great day and happy reading!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=79125d49-2ab1-423c-949b-565792aad37b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
