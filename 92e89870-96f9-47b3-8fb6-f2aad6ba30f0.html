It's great to work with you today. What new coffee blends do we have in store?<p class="message sent">Hey! Yes, nice to work with you too. We just got some new beans in from Colombia. They're meant to have a smooth, nutty flavor with hints of chocolate.<p class=message>That sounds like the perfect match for our new carrot cake with cream cheese frosting! What do you think?<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. How about we pair it with a raspberry latte to add a touch of acidity to balance out the richness?<p class=message>Perfect! And for something lighter, we have a strawberry shortcake with whipped cream. Do you think a vanilla latte would be a good companion?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Vanilla and strawberry go together like peanut butter and jelly. I can't wait to try these pairings out!<p class=message>Speaking of pairings, have you ever tried a coffee cocktail?<p class="message sent">Can't say that I have. What's in it?<p class=message>It's a mixture of coffee, Irish whiskey, cream, and sugar. It's like an adult version of a latte with a kick.<p class="message sent">Wow, that does sound interesting. I'll have to try that after work.<p class=message>Actually, we could serve it as a special after-dinner drink tonight. It could be a great way to end a meal.<p class="message sent">Great idea! I'll get to work on perfecting the recipe for our customers.<p class=message>Awesome! And don't forget to save some of that whiskey for me.<p class="message sent">Haha, of course!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=92e834d8-e19f-435d-993f-911128887ac1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
