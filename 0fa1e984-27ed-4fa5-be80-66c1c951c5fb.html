How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain, just been busy with some recent penetration test findings.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds interesting. What kind of vulnerabilities did you find?<p class=message>Well, quite a few actually. We identified a bunch of SQL injection flaws and some insecure API endpoints.<p class="message sent">Yikes, those can be pretty serious. Did you manage to exploit them?<p class=message>Yeah, we were able to get in and extract some sensitive data. But the good news is that we've already provided the client with some recommendations on how to fix those issues.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. How do you usually go about fixing them?<p class=message>It really depends on the specific vulnerabilities, but typically we'll recommend things like input sanitization, parameterization of SQL queries, and implementing proper authentication and authorization protocols.<p class="message sent">Got it, that all makes sense. Have you noticed any common mistakes or oversights when it comes to fixing these issues?<p class=message>Definitely. One thing we often see is developers not implementing proper error handling, which can lead to information disclosure. Another common mistake is not properly validating user input, which can open up the door for SQL injection and other types of attacks.<p class="message sent">That's really helpful to know. Thanks for sharing all that.<p class=message>No problem, always happy to chat about security! By the way, how's the development going with that new project you're working on?<p class="message sent">It's coming along, although we're still trying to iron out a few bugs. I might need to ask for your help with some security testing once we get closer to launch.<p class=message>Hey, you know I'm always happy to lend a hand. Just let me know when you're ready!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0fa1bea9-1f0f-4bae-899b-a94abb982838.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
