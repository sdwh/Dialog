Have you heard any good places for live music?<p class="message sent">Yeah, there are a lot of great venues around here. Have you heard of the Big Cat Club?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Tell me more about it.<p class="message sent">It's a pretty popular spot for music lovers, and they often host big-name musicians. Maybe we can try to get a gig there!<p class=message>That sounds amazing! But before we start looking for gigs, let's check out some of the local music shops and see what kind of instruments they have.<p class="message sent">Good idea. I've heard there's a street nearby that's famous for music shops. Let's head over there and check it out.<p class=message>Wow, these stores have so many instruments I've never seen before. I feel like a kid in a candy store!<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's amazing how different the styles can be in different areas. Maybe we can even pick up some new gear.<p class=message>That would be great! Hey, maybe we can even find a unique instrument to use in our performances.<p class="message sent">Ooh, like what?<p class=message>Maybe some traditional Japanese instruments, like a shakuhachi or koto. It would add some local flair to our shows.<p class="message sent">I love that idea! We'll definitely stand out. And who knows, maybe we'll even get invited to perform at some local festivals.<p class=message>That would be a dream come true. I can't wait to see what opportunities come our way while we're here.<p class="message sent">Me too. Let's keep exploring and see where this musical adventure takes us!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b638eab1-6514-4e4b-80f5-e095c382c45b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
