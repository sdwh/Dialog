It's a beautiful day outside. How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm doing alright, I suppose. Just another day in this fine establishment.<p class=message>Well, I'm here to make it a little more enjoyable for you. Would you like to play some cards or maybe do a crossword puzzle?<p class="message sent">Oh, I haven't played cards in ages. I used to be quite good at poker, you know.<p class=message>Really? Well, I'll have to watch out for any sneaky moves then. Let's get started!<p class="message sent">(laughs) You're on! Do you mind shuffling the deck first?<p class=message>Not at all. It's always good to have a fair game.<p class="message sent">Say, have you heard any good jokes lately? I could use a good laugh.<p class=message>Actually, I did hear one the other day. Why was the math book sad?<p class="message sent">I don't know, why?<p class=message>Because it had too many problems!<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's a good one! You've got quite the sense of humor, A. Speaking of which, did you catch the game last night?<p class=message>I did, and my team won! I can't wait for the playoffs.<p class="message sent">Ah, a fellow sports fan. What's your favorite team?<p class=message>The Lakers. I've been a fan since I was a kid.<p class="message sent">The Lakers, huh? Well, I'll have to root for them too, then. I'm not much of a basketball fan but I always support the local team.<p class=message>That's great to hear! We should watch a game together sometime.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a plan. Thank you for being such a thoughtful nurse, A. You always know how to brighten up my day.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, Mr. B. Taking care of you is the highlight of my day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ff3222a3-84a3-40e6-8b28-13c47b8240e5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
