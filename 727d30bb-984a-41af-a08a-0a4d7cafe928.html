Seen any exciting code lately?<p class="message sent">Hey A! Yeah, actually, I found a pretty gnarly bug last week during our code review session. I was surprised I even caught it!<p class=message>Oh really? What was it?<p class="message sent">Well, it was a classic case of off-by-one error. It took me a while to track it down, but I finally managed to get it fixed.<p class=message>Nice work! Did you have any trouble with it?<p class="message sent">Not really, just had to put on my detective hat and start tracing through the code pixel by pixel. You know how it is.<p class=message>Definitely. What tool did you use to find it?<p class="message sent">I actually used one of those automated code analysis tools. It caught the error and pointed me in the right direction, but it still took some legwork to get it fixed.<p class=message>Yeah, I've used those tools before. They can be a real lifesaver, but they're not always foolproof.<p class="message sent">Agreed. At the end of the day, nothing beats a good old-fashioned code review with a fresh set of eyes.<p class=message>Absolutely. Speaking of which, I've got a code review scheduled for this afternoon. Mind taking a look at some of my code?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Let's go grab some coffee and we'll get started.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=72777918-efb6-450c-aeee-af1b535fc0c7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
