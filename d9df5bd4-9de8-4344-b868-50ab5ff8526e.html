My name is Sarah, and I'll be your guide for the day.<p class=message>Well, we have a large variety of animals here, including elk, deer, coyotes, and occasionally we even get sightings of bears.<p class=message>We have strict guidelines in place to ensure that the animals remain safe and have enough space to roam around freely. We also have a team of wildlife veterinarians who monitor their health and well-being.<p class=message>Actually, there are plenty of ways that you can help out. One way is to spread awareness about the importance of wildlife conservation and the need to protect our natural habitats.<p class=message>Absolutely, we ask that you maintain a distance of at least 50 meters from any wildlife you may encounter. And please, refrain from feeding them as it can disrupt their natural habits and possibly make them sick.<p class=message>Hmm, well, it really depends on the season. During the summer months, we tend to see more deer and elk. But in the winter, you may have a chance to spot some of the more elusive animals like cougars or lynx.<p class=message>You're welcome. Now, let's get started on our nature walk and see what kind of wildlife we can discover today!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d9deac99-8952-4404-958d-f71aa29cc0e1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
