I hope everyone had a great weekend. How are you today, B?<p class="message sent">Hi, Teacher A! I'm feeling fantastic today. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. So, let's start today's lesson. We'll be discussing idioms, which are fun expressions in English that don't always make literal sense. For example, the phrase "to let the cat out of the bag" means to reveal a secret.<p class="message sent">Oh, I've heard of that one before! Can you give us more examples?<p class=message>Sure! "It's raining cats and dogs" means it's raining very heavily. And "break a leg" means good luck, especially for performers.<p class="message sent">That's really interesting, Teacher A. I think idioms are a great way to make English more colorful.<p class=message>I agree! And it's important to learn them, because you might hear them in movies, TV shows, or casual conversations. Now, let's try to use some idioms in sentences. How about you, B? Can you give me a sentence that uses "the ball is in your court"?<p class="message sent">Sure! "I've done my part of the project, now the ball is in your court to finish the rest."<p class=message>Excellent! You got it right. Now, let's see if the rest of the class can do it. Who else has a sentence with an idiom?<p class=message>Yes, C?<p class=message>Perfect! You all did a great job. Keep practicing your idioms, and you'll be using them like a native speaker in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9fbe629a-fc84-4fe4-8a72-1a16ce7e71c7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
