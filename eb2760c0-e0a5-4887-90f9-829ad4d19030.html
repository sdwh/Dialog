Just trying to figure out ways to improve the network security of our company. What about you?<p class=message>Same here. It's crucial, especially with the rise of cyber attacks these days.<p class="message sent">I agree. I was thinking we could start by updating our firewalls and installing better antivirus software.<p class=message>Yep, those are definitely steps in the right direction. But have you considered implementing two-factor authentication?<p class="message sent">Two-factor authentication? Can you explain what that is?<p class=message>It's when you need more than just a password to access an account. For example, you might need to enter a code sent to your phone, or use a fingerprint scanner.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. That sounds like a good idea. It would certainly make it harder for hackers to get in.<p class=message>Definitely. And speaking of passwords, have you heard of the advice to use a different password for every account?<p class="message sent">Yes, but it's such a pain to remember all those passwords.<p class=message>True, but using a password manager can help with that. It remembers all your passwords for you.<p class="message sent">Good point. We just need to make sure we choose a trustworthy password manager.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we should also train our employees to be more aware of phishing attempts and other scams.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's crucial too. It only takes one person to accidentally click on a phishing link for the whole network to be compromised.<p class=message>Exactly. Well, it looks like we have our work cut out for us! But I'm confident we can make some real improvements in this area.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eb273a12-8557-4d17-954d-f1d46efd7af6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
