How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too, A! I'm doing well, thank you. Are you all set for your trip to Delhi?<p class=message>Yes, I am! I'm really excited about it. Have you ever been to Delhi before, B?<p class="message sent">Many times, actually. It's a beautiful city with lots of history and culture. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you have any suggestions for things to see or do while I'm there?<p class="message sent">Well, there's the Red Fort, Qutub Minar, Lotus Temple, and of course, the famous street food. You should definitely try some!<p class=message>Oh, I love trying new foods! What's your favorite dish in Delhi?<p class="message sent">I would have to say it's the butter chicken. It's a popular dish all over India, but it tastes the best here in Delhi.<p class=message>Yum! I'll definitely try that. So, how long have you been working as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving taxis for the past 10 years. It's a good job, and I enjoy meeting people from all over the world.<p class=message>That's really cool. Do you have any funny stories to share about your experiences as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh, I have plenty of stories. One time, I picked up a group of tourists who were trying to speak Hindi, but kept getting the words wrong. It was pretty hilarious!<p class=message>(laughs) Sounds like a fun time. Have you ever had any celebrities in your taxi before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. I once drove a famous Bollywood actress to the airport. She was very kind and even took a photo with me.<p class=message>Wow, that's amazing! Well, we're almost there. Thank you for the great conversation, B. It was nice getting to know you.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. I hope you have a great time in Delhi, and be sure to try the butter chicken!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=85f3ea47-0b00-4c6c-91d1-f72584ffddcb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
