Are you ready to teach me how to make your famous Thai red braised pork and sides?<p class="message sent">Of course, A! Thank you for your interest in learning. First, we will marinate the pork with the essentials: garlic, ginger, star anise, soy sauce, and sugar.<p class=message>Sounds good. And what about the sides? I see some vegetables over there.<p class="message sent">Those are Chinese cabbage, carrots, and mushrooms. We will stir-fry them with oyster sauce and soy sauce to complement the pork.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. How long should we leave the pork to marinate?<p class="message sent">It's best to do it overnight so that the flavors are well-absorbed. But we can let it marinate for at least an hour if we're in a hurry.<p class=message>I think I can wait for the perfect result. What's the next step after marinating?<p class="message sent">After marinating, we will sear the pork and braise it with water until it is tender. We will then simmer it with the sauce until it is thick and flavorful.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work, but I'm sure it will be worth it. What are the special ingredients in the sauce?<p class="message sent">The sauce has additional ingredients, such as red fermented tofu, cinnamon, and orange peel. It gives the pork that unique aroma and taste.<p class=message>I can't wait to try it! By the way, what should we do with the vegetables?<p class="message sent">We will stir-fry them in a wok with oil, garlic, and ginger until they are cooked but still crisp. We will then add oyster sauce and soy sauce for seasoning.<p class=message>I see you're an expert in balancing flavors. What's the secret to stir-frying?<p class="message sent">The secret to stir-frying is to have everything prepared and ready, as the cooking process is quick. And of course, high heat and a good wok are important factors.<p class=message>I'm learning so much today, thanks to you, B. Is there any final touch to the dish?<p class="message sent">Yes, we will top the pork with chopped green onions and cilantro for freshness, and serve it with steamed rice.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. I can't wait to taste it. Thank you for teaching me, B.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. It was my pleasure to share my knowledge with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b4b6be25-bd55-40b3-8b29-9a5a12bbbb1d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
