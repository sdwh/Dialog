Have you ever thought about becoming a tennis player for our school?<p class="message sent">Hmm, not really. Tennis is not really my thing. But, I'm interested to know more. Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I heard that the tennis team got really popular last season. The players were the talk of the school for a while.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. So, how do we become tennis players exactly?<p class=message>We can start by practicing and training at least twice a week. We can also attend tennis clinics and work with a coach to improve our skills.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of hard work. But, I guess we can give it a try.<p class=message>Great! We can also form a doubles team for the school tournament. Who knows, we might become the talk of the town!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well, if it means gaining popularity, count me in! But, let's not forget to have fun while we're at it.<p class=message>Of course! Tennis is a great way to stay active and have some fun with friends. Plus, it's a good way to show off our competitive sides.<p class="message sent">Alright then. Let's get started and become the tennis players of the century!<p class=message>(laughs) We'll see about that. But, one thing's for sure - we'll have a blast trying to achieve our goal.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Let's do this, partner.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0b89538b-c9d0-4c74-91d3-3ad321da4472.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
