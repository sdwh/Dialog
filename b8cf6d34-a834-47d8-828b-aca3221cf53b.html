Have you found any controls that stood out for you?<p class="message sent">Well, I did find control A.8.1.1 to be quite interesting.<p class=message>What's that one about?<p class="message sent">It's about establishing ownership for information assets. I think it's important for organizations to know who is responsible for what.<p class=message>That's a good point. I also noticed control A.9.1.3 about secure disposal of information.<p class="message sent">Ah yes, I saw that one too. It's important to not only secure information while it's being used, but also when it's no longer needed.<p class=message>Exactly. It's all about reducing the risk of data breaches.<p class="message sent">Right. Have you seen control A.14.1.5 about information security in project management?<p class=message>I have - it's crucial for all aspects of a project to be secure, not just the end product.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And what about control A.17.1.1 concerning information security incident management?<p class=message>Oh yes, that one is important as well. It outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Overall, I think the ISO 27001 controls are important standard to follow for any organization.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. It's always better to be proactive and preventative when it comes to information security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b8c21c89-02af-46f1-9807-40a905e716fa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
