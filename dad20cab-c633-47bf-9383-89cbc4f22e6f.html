What medication were you prescribed?<p class="message sent">I was prescribed some antibiotics for a sinus infection.<p class=message>Great, antibiotics are effective but it's important to follow the instructions carefully. Did your doctor provide you with any specific instructions or warnings?<p class="message sent">Yes, they told me to take the medication with food and to complete the entire course.<p class=message>Those are important instructions. Taking antibiotics on an empty stomach can cause nausea and vomiting. And completing the full course helps to prevent resistance to the medication.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. Are there any other things I should be aware of?<p class=message>Yes, itâ€™s important to avoid taking other medications with your antibiotics. This can affect how your antibiotics work, and might even cause unwanted side effects.<p class="message sent">I didn't realize that. Thank you for letting me know.<p class=message>Additionally, if you do experience any side effects, like a rash or diarrhea, it's important to let your doctor know right away.<p class="message sent">I will definitely do that. Thank you so much for your help!<p class=message>You're welcome. Is there anything else you need help with today?<p class="message sent">No, that's all. Thank you again for your time.<p class=message>Of course, have a good day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dacf990a-265b-46cd-b48e-d1aa49644f87.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
