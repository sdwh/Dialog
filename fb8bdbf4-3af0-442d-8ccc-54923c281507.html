I see that you're making some traditional candy. What kind is it?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, we're making Kong Hong, a famous candy from Chaozhou. Have you tried it before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's in it?<p class="message sent">We use maltose, nuts, sesame seeds, and coconut flakes. We cook it over high heat until it becomes soft and chewy.<p class=message>Wow, sounds delicious! Can I try a sample?<p class="message sent">Of course! Here you go.<p class=message>Mmm, this is amazing! How long has your family been making candy?<p class="message sent">We've been making Kong Hong for over 50 years. It's a traditional recipe that's been passed down in our family for generations.<p class=message>That's incredible. It must take a lot of skill and practice to make candy like this.<p class="message sent">Indeed, it does. It takes years of practice to get the texture and flavor just right.<p class=message>Do you have any tips for making candy at home?<p class="message sent">Sure, the key is to be patient and careful. You have to pay attention to the temperature and timing to avoid burning the candy.<p class=message>Good to know. I'll have to try making it at home sometime. Thanks for the advice!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Let us know if you need any ingredients or tools. We'd be happy to help you get started.<p class=message>That's very kind of you. I'll definitely keep that in mind. By the way, do you have any other flavors of candy?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have many other flavors like lychee, peanut, and coconut. Feel free to try them all!<p class=message>I definitely will. Thanks again for the delicious candy and helpful tips. It was great to meet you!<p class="message sent">The pleasure is all ours. Enjoy the candy and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fb86cc67-2993-41ef-9106-15babdeb2e8b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
