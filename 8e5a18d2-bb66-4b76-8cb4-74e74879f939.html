How's it going today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thanks. Just finished baking a fresh batch of croissants.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! I can't wait to try one with a cup of our classic French coffee.<p class="message sent">Yes, our coffee and bread make the perfect combination. Speaking of coffee, have you tried the new blend we got in last week?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've heard great things about it. Maybe I'll try it on my break.<p class="message sent">Definitely do! It's a medium roast with notes of chocolate and hazelnut. Perfect for a cozy day like today.<p class=message>Sounds great. By the way, have you noticed any changes in the customers' orders lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. It seems like more people are ordering our almond croissants and pain au chocolat.<p class=message>Oh, I love the almond croissants! It's nice to see our menu items gaining more popularity.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And with the holiday season coming up, I need to start brainstorming some new flavors and decorations for our special pastries.<p class=message>That's a great idea. We want to make sure our customers feel special, especially during the festive season.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's all about creating an experience that they can't find anywhere else.<p class=message>Well, I know I'm excited to see what you come up with. You never disappoint.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I appreciate the support. As always, let me know if you need any help with the coffee orders.<p class=message>Will do. Thanks, B. Let's keep serving the best French coffee and bread in Strasbourg!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8e5961bd-e23f-4e95-8466-829f69b6a3df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
