I hope your day is going well. Are you working on the ISO 27001 audit report too?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I just finished conducting the audit and I am now in the process of drafting the final audit report.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Are there any interesting findings that you came across during the audit?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I noticed that one of the employees had a password on a sticky note on their computer screen. Talk about cringe-worthy!<p class=message>Oh no, that's a huge security breach. Did you report it to the management?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. It's important to raise such issues as soon as possible to ensure the security of the company's system.<p class=message>You're absolutely right. Did you face any challenges during the audit process?<p class="message sent">Well, there were a few instances where the employees were reluctant to provide crucial information. But, with some persuasion, they eventually cooperated.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Did you find any areas that the company excels in with regards to their information security management system?<p class="message sent">Definitely. The IT team had implemented measures such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems, which were functioning seamlessly.<p class=message>That's great. It's always good to see that companies are taking their information security seriously. How far along are you with the final report?<p class="message sent">I'm almost done. I just need to add the recommendations and any corrective actions that need to be taken.<p class=message>Sounds like you're on track. How many days will it take until the report is submitted to the management?<p class="message sent">I would say about three to four days. It's important to take the time to ensure that everything is accurate and in order.<p class=message>Agreed. Thanks for the update on your progress. I hope the recommendations and corrective actions are well received by the management.<p class="message sent">Thanks. I do hope so too. It's been a pleasure talking to you about this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=88d829ab-9a4c-4555-b557-12ac222b2228.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
