I used to come here all the time when I was your age.<p class="message sent">Really, Dad? That's so cool. What did you used to do here?<p class=message>Well, I used to play soccer with my friends, and we would climb up that big oak tree over there.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like so much fun. Do you still play soccer?<p class=message>Not as much as I used to when I was younger, but I like to play every once in a while. Would you like to learn how to play soccer too?<p class="message sent">Yeah, that would be really cool! Can we start practicing together?<p class=message>Of course! I'd love to teach you. Maybe we can come back to this park and have a game with some of your friends.<p class="message sent">That would be awesome, Dad! Thanks for sharing your memories with me.<p class=message>Anytime, son. This park is full of memories for me, and I hope it can create some great memories for you too.<p class="message sent">Speaking of memories, what's your favorite childhood memory?<p class=message>Hmm, that's a tough one. But I think it would have to be the time I went on a camping trip with my family. We hiked in the mountains, went fishing, and had a bonfire at night.<p class="message sent">That sounds like so much fun. Maybe we can plan a camping trip too.<p class=message>That's a great idea, B. We'll definitely have to plan one soon. But for now, let's just enjoy this beautiful day in the park.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9648fa23-1b12-45a0-92c0-9d271f9fe668.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
