How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I need your legal advice for a lawsuit. I've been sued for borrowing and not returning a friend's book.<p class=message>A lawsuit over a book? That's quite interesting! How long ago did you borrow it?<p class="message sent">I borrowed it a year ago and I completely forgot about it. Then, my friend moved and I lost contact with her.<p class=message>Well, technically the book isn't yours, so you should return it. However, a lawsuit may be excessive for a book. Have you tried reaching out to your friend?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I apologized and asked to return the book, but she insists on suing me.<p class=message>In that case, we can try to settle out of court. Maybe you can offer to pay for the book and any additional expenses. That may be a more cost-effective solution for both parties.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I'll reach out to her again and offer to settle. Thank you for your guidance.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. Remember that in any legal situation, communication and compromise are key. Let me know if you need any further assistance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6de3b545-aca5-42bb-ae30-7d12a68a00d4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
