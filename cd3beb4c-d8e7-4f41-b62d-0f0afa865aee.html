I was wondering if you had any ideas for our menu redesign.<p class="message sent">Hey A, I think we should definitely include more vegetarian and vegan options.<p class=message>That's a great idea. What did you have in mind?<p class="message sent">Well, there are a lot of great meat substitutes out there that we could incorporate into dishes like burgers and tacos.<p class=message>I like the sound of that. What about sides? Anything new we could try?<p class="message sent">How about some crispy roasted Brussels sprouts with a balsamic glaze? Or maybe some grilled asparagus with lemon and Parmesan.<p class=message>Yum, those sound delicious. What about our entrees? Should we stick to the classics or mix it up a bit?<p class="message sent">I think we could do a little bit of both. Maybe a classic steak dish, but with a twist like a chimichurri sauce.<p class=message>Nice, I like it. What other ingredients do you think we should focus on?<p class="message sent">I really think we should highlight local produce and meats. It's important to support our community and showcase what's available in our area.<p class=message>Agreed. And let's not forget about some tasty seafood dishes too.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We have some great options available here in Johannesburg, like fresh tuna and calamari.<p class=message>I'm getting hungry just thinking about it all. Thanks for your input B, you always have great ideas.<p class="message sent">No problem A, it's my pleasure. Let's make this menu the best one yet!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cd3870d4-9dbf-40af-98c4-0ef2f72903f2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
