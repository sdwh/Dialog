How's business at the fish market today?<p class="message sent">Not too shabby, A! Got some really fresh catches this morning. How's the restaurant business treating you?<p class=message>It's been great! Of course, it helps that I have a reliable source like you for all my seafood needs.<p class="message sent">Of course, of course. So, what's on the menu today?<p class=message>We're doing a special on grilled octopus with lemon and garlic. It's been a hit so far.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! I might have to try it for myself later.<p class=message>You should! And while you're here, I highly recommend the seafood paella. It's a fan favorite.<p class="message sent">I don't doubt it. Anything else new and exciting you've got going on?<p class=message>Well, we're thinking about incorporating some Asian-inspired dishes into the menu. Maybe some sushi or sashimi.<p class="message sent">Great idea! I've got some top-grade tuna and salmon in stock if you're interested.<p class=message>Absolutely! Let's set something up for next week.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Hey, have you ever tried using crayfish in your dishes?<p class=message>Can't say that I have. Why do you ask?<p class="message sent">Oh, they've been really popular over at my stand. Maybe we can collaborate on a crayfish boil or something.<p class=message>Now that's an idea. I like the way you think, B.<p class="message sent">Gotta stay ahead of the game, my friend.<p class=message>You're right. Speaking of which, have you heard about the new seafood joint that just opened up down the street?<p class="message sent">I have, but I'm not worried. No one can beat the freshness and quality of our products.<p class=message>You got that right. Alright, B, I better get back to the kitchen. Thanks for stopping by and chatting.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. I'll see you soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=25ee0013-7193-4cd4-b40d-95fa41690aee.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
