It’s a standard that helps keep information secure, right?<p class=message>That’s right! I’m actually working on implementing it in our company. Do you have any experience with it?<p class="message sent">Not really, but I’ve heard that it can be complex. How are you finding it?<p class=message>It definitely has its challenges, but it’s worth it to keep our information safe.<p class="message sent">For sure. Are you finding it difficult to get everyone on board with the changes?<p class=message>Absolutely! But I’m hosting a training session next week to help everyone understand its importance.<p class="message sent">Nice! I think training is key to making sure everyone is on the same page.<p class=message>Definitely. And it’s always a good idea to have policies in place to prevent data breaches.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Have you considered getting certified in ISO 27001?<p class=message>I have, but I’m not sure if it’s worth the investment. What do you think?<p class="message sent">I think it shows your commitment to the standard and gives clients confidence in our security measures.<p class=message>That’s a good point. Do you have any tips for studying for the exam?<p class="message sent">Just make sure you understand the concepts and how they apply to your specific company. And don’t forget to take practice tests!<p class=message>Thanks for the advice! It’s always helpful to hear from someone with experience.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. And good luck with the training session!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=674c0db6-ebdf-43b2-a303-b92b93ace268.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
