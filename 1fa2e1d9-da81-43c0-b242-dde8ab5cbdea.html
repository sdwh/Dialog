Are you in charge of luggage handling?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. Nice to meet you. How can I help you?<p class=message>I noticed some passengers are worried about losing their luggage. What's the process for transporting luggage to and from the plane?<p class="message sent">Well, first we tag the luggage with a destination code, and then load it onto carts that are sent to the plane. Once the plane lands, we unload the carts and put the luggage onto conveyor belts, which transport them to the baggage claim area.<p class=message>Interesting! Do you ever come across any weird or unusual items in the luggage?<p class="message sent">Oh, all the time! Just last week, I saw a suitcase filled with nothing but jars of peanut butter.<p class=message>(Laughs) That's hilarious! Have you seen anything even crazier?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. One time we found a live lobster in a carry-on bag. We had to call the airline and make special arrangements for it to be transported safely.<p class=message>Wow, that's something. I'll have to keep an eye on the luggage when I'm boarding passengers.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And if you ever see anything questionable, just let us know. We're here to make sure everything runs smoothly.<p class=message>Great, thank you for the insight. It was nice chatting with you.<p class="message sent">Pleasure talking to you too. Have a safe flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f9a24e9-5fc1-4d83-9425-9c9dbf840b34.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
