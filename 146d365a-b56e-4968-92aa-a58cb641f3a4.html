It's like a superhero protecting our company's information.<p class=message>Haha, that's a good one! But in all seriousness, it is an important role in ensuring our company's security.<p class="message sent">Definitely, they're the ones making sure our data is safe from any cyber attacks.<p class=message>And they have to be experts in risk assessment and management too. It's not an easy job.<p class="message sent">I heard they also have to constantly stay up to date with the latest security threats and solutions.<p class=message>Yep, that's true. They're like a walking encyclopedia of everything security.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a tough job but at least they get to be the hero of the company.<p class=message>For sure! They can even have their own costume and theme song.<p class="message sent">Haha, yes! And when they enter the office, the lights should dim and they should have their own special introduction.<p class=message>Maybe we should suggest it to the boss. We could use some entertainment in the office.<p class="message sent">I don't know about that, but we can definitely show our appreciation to our ISO when they keep our data safe.<p class=message>Agreed, let's give them a high five and a superhero cape to wear around the office.<p class="message sent">Haha, I think they might appreciate a raise more.<p class=message>True, but a little recognition and appreciation can go a long way too.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Cheers to our ISO and their superhero-like efforts!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1469af87-b980-4f7d-8c15-1b05c89a32a3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
