How was the fishing today?<p class="message sent">It was great! I managed to catch some fresh salmon and tuna.<p class=message>That's fantastic. I think our customers will surely enjoy those. What about the secret recipe you promised to share with me?<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. It's a family recipe of grilled swordfish with a special marinade made of lemon zest, garlic, and olive oil.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. Can you teach me how to prepare it?<p class="message sent">Of course! It's pretty easy. First, you need to mix the lemon zest, garlic, and olive oil with salt and pepper. Then, marinade the swordfish for at least 2 hours before grilling it.<p class=message>Thank you for sharing the secret with me. I'm sure our customers will be amazed by this recipe.<p class="message sent">I'm glad I could help. By the way, do you have any recommendations for a seafood dish that will go well with my sardine catch?<p class=message>How about serving them as tapas with roasted red peppers and crusty bread? It's a classic Spanish dish that our customers love.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I'll give it a try. You really know your seafood, A.<p class=message>Thank you, B. That's what I'm here for. Let's keep up the good work and serve the best and freshest seafood in the harbor.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=703cd360-a49d-4c3c-a739-75bbc961d7ad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
