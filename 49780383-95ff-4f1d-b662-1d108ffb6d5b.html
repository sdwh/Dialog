Thanks for joining us today.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. Always happy to speak with the press.<p class=message>So, we've heard that you have a new policy proposal. Can you tell us a little bit about it?<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed. I'm proposing a bill that would make it mandatory for restaurants to offer free dessert with every meal.<p class=message>(chuckles) That sounds like a policy I could get behind. But what is the reasoning behind it?<p class="message sent">Well, A, dessert is an important part of any meal. And it's been scientifically proven that people are happier when they have something sweet to finish off their dining experience. Plus, it's a great way for restaurants to stand out and attract more customers.<p class=message>I can't argue with that logic. But what about the cost? Some restaurant owners might not be thrilled about offering a free dessert.<p class="message sent">Ah, but that's where the government comes in. We'll be providing subsidies for restaurants that participate in the program. And we believe that the increased revenue from extra customers will more than make up for the cost of a free dessert.<p class=message>I have to say, this could be a game-changer for the restaurant industry. But what kind of dessert are we talking about here? Is it limited to certain options?<p class="message sent">Not at all, A. Restaurants can offer any dessert they want, as long as it's complimentary. So, whether it's a slice of cake or a scoop of ice cream, customers will be getting a little something extra to sweeten their day.<p class=message>Well, count me in, Mr. B. I'll be looking for restaurants that participate in this program.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Glad to hear it, A. And I hope the rest of the public is just as excited about this proposal as you are.<p class=message>Absolutely. Thanks so much for sharing your ideas with us today, Mr. B.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, A. Thanks for having me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=497783b5-82b1-4843-bc14-c77d78b06135.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
