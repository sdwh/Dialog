I see you're working on a report. Need any help?<p class="message sent">Oh, hi. Yes, I'm doing a report on the history of chocolate. It's quite interesting but I'm having trouble finding some specific information.<p class=message>That sounds like a fun topic! What kind of information are you looking for?<p class="message sent">I'm trying to find out when chocolate was first introduced to Europe.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Well, according to my research, chocolate was brought to Europe by the Spanish in the 1500s. It was initially consumed as a drink, and it wasn't until later that it was turned into a solid form for eating.<p class="message sent">Really? That's so interesting. I had no idea.<p class=message>Yes, and did you know that the first chocolate bar was created by the British chocolate company, Fry's, in 1847?<p class="message sent">No way! That's so cool. Thank you for the information.<p class=message>You're welcome! So, are you enjoying doing this report?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I love chocolate, so it's been fun learning about its history.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Well, if you need any more help, just let me know.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks again!<p class=message>No problem. Enjoy the rest of your project.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I will!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=85ca6aaf-af4d-44fa-bb62-79fd8c955ad6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
