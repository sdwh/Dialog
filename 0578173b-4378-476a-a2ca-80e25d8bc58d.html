How are you doing today?<p class="message sent message-content">Not bad, A. What's up?<p class="message received message-content">I just wanted to discuss the new book I'm working on and get your thoughts on it.<p class="message sent message-content">Sure, tell me about it.<p class="message received message-content">It's a novel about a detective who solves a crime underground in New York City.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds interesting. What makes it unique?<p class="message received message-content">Well, I've added a touch of humor to it. The detective is quite clumsy and makes hilarious mistakes.<p class="message sent message-content">I like that. It makes the story more relatable. What's the title?<p class="message received message-content">"The Slippery Sleuth."<p class="message sent message-content">(laughs) That's a good one. How far along are you with the manuscript?<p class="message received message-content">I've just finished the first draft. I need to go through it again and make some edits.<p class="message sent message-content">Great, let me know when you're ready. I'd love to take a look and see if we can get it published.<p class="message received message-content">Thanks, B. I appreciate your support. By the way, have you read any good books lately?<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, I just finished a thriller called "The Silent Patient." It kept me on edge the whole time.<p class="message received message-content">I've heard of that one. I might have to give it a read. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent message-content">No problem.
