Our company believes in giving our customers a luxurious experience.<p class=message>I see. Hey, B, do you have a favorite type of cuisine?<p class="message sent">I like steak. I can smell it coming from your takeaway. It smells delicious.<p class=message>Yes, sir. I got some juicy steaks from the restaurant nearby. Want to share some?<p class="message sent">Why not? It’s unusual for me to have steak during my shift. I don’t know why, but eating in a car gives me a different kind of thrill.<p class=message>Speaking of odd thrill, do you also like red wine, B?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do! What would you recommend?<p class=message>This Tempranillo is good. Try it.<p class="message sent">*sniffs* Smells good. *drinks* Wow, it's excellent!<p class=message>I think so too. So B, what do you like to do when you're not driving?<p class="message sent">I enjoy spending time with my family. We like to travel together and experience different cuisines.<p class=message>That sounds like fun. I wish I could travel more.<p class="message sent">You should! Travelling opens our eyes to different cultures and perspectives. In fact, I’ve learned some great recipes from my travels.<p class=message>Oh really? What’s your favorite dish to cook?<p class="message sent">I love cooking chicken biryani. It's a dish from India, and it’s always a hit with my family.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds delicious. You'll have to share the recipe with me sometime.<p class="message sent">I'd love to, sir. Anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>No, thank you, B. You've been a wonderful driver and conversation partner. I guess I'll see you when I'm in town again.<p class="message sent">It was a pleasure meeting you, sir. Have a safe trip.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b618704-1797-4472-a400-6977793e33f1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
