And for madam?<p class="message sent">So, how's business tonight, A?<p class=message>Not too shabby. We've been quite busy since six o'clock.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Have any regulars stopped by?<p class=message>Yes, actually. Mr. Smith and his wife came in earlier. They seem to really enjoy the food here.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic! I hope they have a lovely evening. By the way, A, have you tried the new dessert?<p class=message>Oh, the sticky toffee pudding? Yes, it's heavenly!<p class="message sent">You have me convinced. I'll have a slice after my meal.<p class=message>Great choice, sir. And don't forget the ice cream on top.<p class=message>You're in for a real treat, madam. Our chef cooks it to perfection.<p class="message sent">Speaking of our chef, A, have you heard him rant about football?<p class=message>Oh, you mean his obsession with Tottenham Hotspur? Yes, I think the whole kitchen knows by now.<p class=message>Absolutely. And our chef's just happens to be football and food.<p class="message sent">Well, we can't fault him for being passionate about his work and hobbies.<p class=message>That's very true, sir.
