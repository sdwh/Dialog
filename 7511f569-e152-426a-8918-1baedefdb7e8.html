Are we busy?<p class="message sent">Yeah, A, we're slammed! Everyone seems to love our drinks and snacks.<p class=message>That's great to hear! What's your favorite drink that you've made here?<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough question. But I'd say the Elderflower Collins is one of my favorites. It's light and refreshing with a kick of gin.<p class=message>Oh, I love gin. Maybe you can make me one later when it's not as busy.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A. What about you? Do you have a favorite snack or dish that we're serving?<p class=message>Definitely the truffle fries. They're so addictively good!<p class="message sent">I have to agree. I can't resist them either. And the dipping sauce is the perfect complement.<p class=message>Yeah, people have been raving about that sauce. It's a good thing we have extra. Can you make a few more batches for the bar?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'll head to the kitchen right away. By the way, have you seen the new glassware that we got in last week?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Show me!<p class="message sent">Check it out. These copper mugs are perfect for our Moscow Mules. And the stemless wine glasses are so elegant.<p class=message>Wow, those look amazing. Our customers are going to love them. Hey, have you heard any good jokes lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, I just read a joke about a man who cut his finger chopping cheese, but he said it was all worth it for the Brie.<p class=message>Haha! That's a good one. You always have the best puns, B.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. Speaking of puns, what do you call a fake noodle?<p class=message>Hmm, I don't know. What?<p class="message sent">An impasta!<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious! You're a natural comedian, B.<p class="message sent">Just trying to keep the mood light and fun, A. It's always more enjoyable working when everyone's having a good time.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. You're a great co-worker and even better friend. Let's have a drink together later when it slows down.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A. Cheers to a successful night and many more to come!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=750fba24-af8f-4375-bdaf-ed603be5568c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
