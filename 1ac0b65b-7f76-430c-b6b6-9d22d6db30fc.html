I'm feeling better than yesterday. Thanks for asking.<p class=message>Glad to hear that. I'm here to check your vital signs and see how you're progressing.<p class="message sent">Sure, no problem. Can I ask you a question?<p class=message>Of course, what's on your mind?<p class="message sent">How long have you been a nurse?<p class=message>I've been a registered nurse for 9 years now. I started right after I graduated from nursing school.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. I appreciate your dedication to your work.<p class=message>Thank you, Mr. B. Being a nurse is a fulfilling profession, and I'm happy to be able to help people in need.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. You must have a lot of stories to tell.<p class=message>Yes, I do. Some are funny, some are sad, but overall, I'm grateful for the experiences.<p class="message sent">Can you share one with me?<p class=message>Sure. One time, a patient mistook me for a doctor and started asking me for medical advice. I had to kindly remind them that I am a nurse and not a doctor.<p class="message sent">Haha! That's funny. I'm sure you get mistaken for a doctor a lot since you're so knowledgeable.<p class=message>Thank you, Mr. B. But we're all part of the healthcare team, and everyone plays an important role.<p class="message sent">I agree, teamwork is key. I appreciate all that you and the rest of the healthcare team are doing for me.<p class=message>It's our pleasure, Mr. B. We're here to help you feel better and get back to your daily routine.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Nurse. You're doing a great job.<p class=message>You're welcome, Mr. B. If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1abfd535-71a3-4c9c-931a-c04bca2efaa3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
