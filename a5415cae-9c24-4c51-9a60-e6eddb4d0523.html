Are you having fun testing the software?<p class="message sent">Hi A, to be honest, it's not as exciting as it sounds. But it's necessary.<p class=message>Oh, I know what you mean. It can be boring sometimes. But hey, at least we get to work together!<p class="message sent">That's true. And I must say, your coding skills are impressive. You make my job easier.<p class=message>Thank you! I have to admit, I wouldn't be able to do it without your testing. You catch all the bugs and glitches.<p class="message sent">That's what I'm here for, right? But hey, have you ever thought about switching roles?<p class=message>Me? As a tester? No way. I'm a creative person. I need to be able to code freely without worrying about how it's going to turn out in the end.<p class="message sent">I see. Well, I'll stick to my role then. But you know what they say, it's good to switch things up every now and then.<p class=message>That's true. Maybe we can switch roles for a day and see how challenging it can be.<p class="message sent">You know what, that's not a bad idea. Let's do it!<p class=message>Deal! Let's see if I can find as many bugs as you do.<p class="message sent">Challenge accepted! Let's get back to work now.<p class=message>Right. But before we do, want to grab some coffee later and share some coding war stories?<p class="message sent">I'm down for that. Let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a5401603-dc10-4421-b7a2-24e920bac7d0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
