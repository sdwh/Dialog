Have you made any progress in fixing those code defects we found during the source code check?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm doing alright. As for the defects, I've already identified a few and I'm currently working on fixing them.<p class=message>Great to hear that! Which part of the code did you find the defects in?<p class="message sent">It was in the User Interface section. Some of the buttons weren't working properly and the layout was all over the place.<p class=message>That's interesting. Did you try using any debugging tools to identify the source of the problem?<p class="message sent">Yes, I used a few tools and finally found the issue. It was a syntax error in one of the scripts.<p class=message>I see. Did you manage to fix the error before testing the code again?<p class="message sent">Yes, I fixed it and ran the program again. This time, all the buttons worked smoothly and the layout looked much better.<p class=message>Well done, B! You're really starting to get the hang of this. Do you need any help with the other defects?<p class="message sent">Actually, there's one defect that I'm not sure how to fix. It's in the database connection code.<p class=message>Ah, I understand. Maybe I could take a look and we can work on it together?<p class="message sent">That would be great, A!
