Most Australians eat it on toast with butter or in a sandwich.<p class="message sent">I'm willing to try it! What other unique ingredients do Australians commonly use in their dishes?<p class=message>Some common ingredients include bush herbs and spices, kangaroo meat, and seafood like prawns and barramundi.<p class="message sent">Wow, kangaroo meat is definitely not something I've tried before.
