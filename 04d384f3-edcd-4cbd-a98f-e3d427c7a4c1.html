How about you, A?<p class=message>I'm just happy to see so many satisfied customers.<p class="message sent">Speaking of customers, do you remember that couple from last week? They asked for their meat to be cooked well-done, and then complained it was dry.<p class=message>Haha, yes I remember. Some people just can't make up their minds.<p class="message sent">You know what they say, the customer is always right.<p class=message>Well, they definitely didn't make it easy for us. But I guess that's all part of the job.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And it's worth it for those customers who appreciate our hard work.<p class=message>Speaking of appreciation, have you tried the new sauce I made?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What kind of sauce is it?<p class=message>It's a spicy soy sauce with ginger and garlic. It adds a nice kick to the meat.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing, I need to try it.<p class=message>Go ahead, I have a batch cooking right now. It's my secret recipe.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely keep that in mind. Have you ever thought about opening up your own restaurant, A?<p class=message>Honestly, it's crossed my mind a few times. But for now, I'm happy with what we've accomplished here.<p class="message sent">I agree, this place has a great atmosphere and loyal customers. And we make a great team.<p class=message>That's for sure. We may have our differences, but we always come together to make this place a success.<p class="message sent">It's all about teamwork. And delicious food, of course!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=04d1a1ca-cad1-4a91-920b-1991f9e226f7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
