Are you the software engineer in charge of our security protocol adherence?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's me. Nice to meet you.<p class=message>Great, let's dive right in. How do you ensure that our software is up to date with the latest security measures?<p class="message sent">We perform regular vulnerability scans and patch any identified issues as soon as possible.<p class=message>That's good to hear. How often do you conduct these scans?<p class="message sent">We run them on a weekly basis, but we also perform manual checks whenever there's a major security breach in the industry.<p class=message>Impressive! And what about physical security measures? Are there any protocols in place to protect our servers?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We have 24/7 surveillance, biometric access control, and regular security drills for our personnel.<p class=message>Excellent. Moving on to data privacy, how do you ensure that customer information remains confidential?<p class="message sent">We encrypt all sensitive data and provide access on a need-to-know basis only. We also perform regular audits to make sure that data is being handled appropriately.<p class=message>Well done. And finally, have you had any security incidents in the past year?<p class="message sent">Thankfully, no major incidents to report. We did have a minor phishing attempt, but our employees were quick to spot it and take corrective action.<p class=message>That's great news. I'm very pleased with what I'm hearing. Keep up the good work!<p class="message sent">Thank you, we take security very seriously here. It's been great talking to you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=716ba8a9-68d5-4f1a-ae4e-ab1106959a83.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
