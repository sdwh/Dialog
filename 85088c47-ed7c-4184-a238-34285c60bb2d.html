Welcome to our restaurant. Would you like to have a table for two?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Absolutely, let me grab a menu for you two. Our restaurant offers a wide variety of Australian cuisines. What do you fancy?<p class=message>Hmm, do you have any recommendations for a first timer like me who wants to try authentic Australian dishes?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, mate! You could start with some meat pies, which are a staple in Australia. We also have kangaroo meat dishes which are pretty interesting.<p class=message>Kangaroo meat? Really? That sounds quite exotic. What does it taste like?<p class="message sent">It's gamey, and it tastes similar to venison. But don't worry, we'll cook it to perfection just the way you like it.<p class=message>Sounds adventurous, I think I'll give it a try. And for a side dish, what would you suggest?<p class="message sent">You could try the roasted sweet potatoes with bush spices, which are also Australian native ingredients.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds good. And do you have any Australian desserts that we shouldn't miss?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do! One of our popular desserts is Lamington, which is a sponge cake rolled in chocolate and coconut flakes.<p class=message>Wow, that dessert really looks tempting! I think we'll have the kangaroo meat, sweet potatoes, and Lamington for dessert. Thank you for your recommendations.<p class="message sent">Not a problem at all, mate! It's great to introduce our local dishes to our esteemed guests. I'll place your order right away. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=85085643-ee0f-4909-8c95-a3d5ce0a96b5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
