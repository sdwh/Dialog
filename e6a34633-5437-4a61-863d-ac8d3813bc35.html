How was your day today? Did you learn anything new?<p class="message sent">Hi, Boss A. Yes, it was a great day. I learned how to make Hakata-style ramen and grilled mackerel.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. Tell me more about the grilled mackerel. How did you prepare it?<p class="message sent">First, I marinated the mackerel in a mixture of soy sauce and mirin. Then, I grilled it over high heat for a few minutes on each side until it had a crispy crust.<p class=message>Wow, I bet it was delicious. Hakata-style ramen is one of my favorites. Did you enjoy making it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. The broth was so flavorful, and I learned how to make the perfect chewy noodles.<p class=message>Speaking of noodles, have you tried any of the local specialties? I hear they have a famous dish called mentaiko spaghetti.<p class="message sent">Yes, I tried it for lunch today. It was surprisingly delicious! The spicy cod roe really gave it a kick.<p class=message>That sounds adventurous. I might have to try it myself. What else do you have planned for the week?<p class="message sent">Tomorrow, we're going to learn how to make the famous Hakata-style hot pot. And on Thursday, we'll be visiting a local fish market to select our own fish for grilling.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. I'm excited to see the new dishes you'll bring back to our restaurant. Keep up the great work, Chef B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e6a0edee-0830-4a7e-a110-5d57b838f936.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
