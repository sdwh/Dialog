Why are you asking?<p class=message>Well, our company is thinking of implementing it. Do you think it's worth it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's a great way to test the security of our systems.<p class=message>But I heard it's expensive. Do you think it's worth the investment?<p class="message sent">It definitely is. The cost of a breach is much higher than the cost of implementing this testing.<p class=message>That's true. Do you know any good companies that do this kind of testing?<p class="message sent">Sure, I know a few. Have you heard of XYZ Security?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Are they good?<p class="message sent">They are. They have a lot of experience in this area and have helped many companies like ours.<p class=message>That's great. How often should we do this testing?<p class="message sent">It really depends on the frequency of changes in our systems. At minimum, we should do it annually.<p class=message>I see. Is there anything else we need to consider before implementing this testing?<p class="message sent">We should also look into compliance requirements and make sure we have all necessary documentation.<p class=message>Good point. Do you know the difference between black box and white box testing?<p class="message sent">Black box testing is when the tester has no knowledge of the system, while white box testing is when the tester has access to the system.<p class=message>Got it. Which one do you think is better?<p class="message sent">It really depends on the specific situation, but both can be useful in different ways.<p class=message>Interesting. This is all so new to me, but I'm glad we're having this discussion.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's always good to stay informed about security measures.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e5163cd7-b295-43e0-85d3-e77342991478.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
