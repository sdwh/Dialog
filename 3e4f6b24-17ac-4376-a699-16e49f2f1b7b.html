I feel like I could use some improvement in those areas.<p class=message>Great, we can definitely work on that. We'll start with some ladder drills to warm up those feet.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I hope I don't get tangled up!<p class=message>You'll do great, just take it slow and steady. Remember, it's all about control and precision.<p class="message sent">Got it, I'll keep that in mind.<p class=message>Alright, let's get started! First, we'll do some quick feet in and out of the ladder.<p class="message sent">*panting* Whew, that was intense. How did I do, coach?<p class=message>You did great, B. We still have some work to do, but you're definitely making progress.<p class="message sent">Thanks, coach. I couldn't do it without your guidance.<p class=message>Anytime, B. That's what I'm here for.<p class="message sent">So, what's next on the agenda?<p class=message>We'll move on to some cone drills next, to really work on your change of direction.<p class="message sent">Oh boy, more running! But let's do it.<p class=message>You got this, B. Don't forget to breathe!<p class="message sent">Haha, I won't. Thanks again, coach. I'm looking forward to seeing the improvement.<p class=message>Me too, B.
