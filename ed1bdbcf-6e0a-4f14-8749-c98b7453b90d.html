Let's get started with today's lesson.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Professor. I hope you had a great weekend.<p class=message>Thanks, B. It was nice and quiet.<p class="message sent">That sounds relaxing. I had a pretty eventful weekend myself. I went to a music festival.<p class=message>Oh, which one?<p class="message sent">It was called "Pitchfork." There were so many great bands.<p class=message>That's cool. Who was your favorite?<p class="message sent">Definitely Tame Impala. Have you heard of them?<p class=message>Oh, yes. I love their music. Did they play any new songs?<p class="message sent">Yes, they did. They even debuted a new album.<p class=message>Wow, I can't wait to listen to it. Alright, back to the lesson. Let's talk about the principles of marketing.<p class="message sent">Can you give us an example of a successful marketing campaign?<p class=message>Sure, have you heard of the "Got Milk?" campaign?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's still pretty popular, even today.<p class=message>Exactly. It's a great example of how a simple but catchy phrase can stick in people's minds.<p class="message sent">Interesting. I've always wondered how companies come up with those types of slogans.<p class=message>It usually involves a lot of market research and testing. But sometimes, it's just a stroke of luck.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. Alright, I think I'm starting to understand these concepts better now.<p class=message>That's great to hear, B. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Professor. I'll definitely keep that in mind.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed177ab7-86b1-4ae1-8253-95f516463c3b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
