Welcome to our store. Are you a local or a tourist?<p class="message sent">hey, thanks. I'm actually a tourist. I'm driving around Hokkaido and just passing through this town.<p class=message>well, you've come to the right place. We sell all kinds of local specialities. Have you tried the miso soup here?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. Is it really that good?<p class=message>Absolutely! It's made with miso paste that's only produced here. Trust me, it's worth trying.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll take your word for it. What else would you recommend?<p class=message>Hmm, how about this dried squid? It's a bit chewy, but it's a popular snack around here.<p class="message sent">Really? I don't think I've ever tried dried squid before.<p class=message>Well, you'd better start now because it's really popular here. Oh, and don't forget to try the local sake while you're at it.<p class="message sent">Ah, I'm actually driving so I can't drink any alcohol unfortunately.<p class=message>Oh, I see. Well, how about some Hokkaido milk? It's famous for its creamy taste.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! And maybe some snacks to go with it?<p class=message>Definitely. How about some Shiroi Koibito cookies? They're a popular souvenir from here.<p class="message sent">Great idea! I've heard about those. They look so cute too.<p class=message>They taste even better than they look! Enjoy your snacks and have a safe drive!<p class="message sent">Thanks so much for your recommendations. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town. Goodbye!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3edb8727-11b3-4499-8592-b770d32d19cc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
