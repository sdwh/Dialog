Have a seat. What do you think about our school's current education policy?<p class="message sent">Good morning, sir. I think we could make some improvements. For instance, I suggest we incorporate more experiential learning in our curriculum.<p class=message>What do you mean by experiential learning?<p class="message sent">Well, instead of just reading about a subject in a textbook, students could learn through hands-on experiences, like field trips or simulations.<p class=message>Ah, that's an interesting idea. I know some studies have shown that students tend to retain information better when they learn by doing.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And it's more engaging and fun for them too. Plus, it could help with critical thinking skills and real-life applications.<p class=message>Hmm, I see your point. I'll definitely take that into consideration. What else do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">Another thing we could look into is incorporating more technology in our classrooms. It's the way of the future, and we want our students to be prepared for it.<p class=message>Yes, I understand what you mean. But as you know, not all families may be able to afford their own devices. How do you suggest we address that issue?<p class="message sent">One possible solution could be to have a classroom set of devices that students could use during class time. Or, we could explore partnerships with technology companies to provide discounted devices for our students.<p class=message>Interesting. I'll definitely look into those options. Thanks for bringing up these ideas, B. I'm glad we're on the same page when it comes to improving our education policy.<p class="message sent">Of course, sir. It's always a pleasure to contribute to making our school a better learning environment for our students.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0a5c2dc0-d98c-46f1-bfdf-5827f3c2d01a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
