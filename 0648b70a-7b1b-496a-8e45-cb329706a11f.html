I'm A, the ice cream maker. Nice to meet you, B, the pastry chef.<p class="message sent">Hi, A. Nice to meet you too. Glad to be working with you in this sweet shop.<p class=message>Absolutely. So, what's on your mind today? What kind of desserts are you planning to make?<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking of making a mixed berry pie and a raspberry mousse cake. How about you? What flavors of ice cream are you making?<p class=message>I'm experimenting with a new flavor - spicy chocolate. It's a mix of dark chocolate and cayenne pepper.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that sounds interesting. Bet it'll be a hit with the customers.<p class=message>Yeah, I hope so. Speaking of customers, did you see that group of kids who just walked in? They look like they're ready for some sugar rush.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Ah, the little ones are always in for a treat here. Let's get cracking and serve them with our best desserts.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Hey, have you tried our homemade caramel sauce yet? It's divine!<p class="message sent">No, not yet. Can I have a taste?<p class=message>Sure thing. (hands over the sauce) Go ahead, try it.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, this is amazing! I'm definitely using this in my desserts from now on.<p class=message>I knew you'd love it. (smiling)<p class="message sent">(laughs) You know me too well already, A.<p class=message>It comes with the job, my friend. Say, how did you get into pastry-making anyway?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's a long story. But in short, I had a sweet tooth since childhood and fell in love with baking during my teenage years.<p class=message>Nice. I always knew I wanted to make ice cream since I was a little kid. It's like a dream come true to be running this shop.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's always fulfilling to pursue what you love doing. Speaking of which, we better get back to work before the customers start complaining.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's make some more flavors and dishes that would make them lick their fingers.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You got it, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=06483259-a6de-4b6c-8b33-ddfdbc906b37.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
