It's nice to have you here with me for a walk in the park."<p class="message sent">"Absolutely, Dad. It's always nice to spend some quality time with you."<p class=message>"So, did you hear about the mathematician that was afraid of negative numbers?"<p class="message sent">"No, I can't say I have. What happened?"<p class=message>"He will stop at nothing to avoid them. Get it? Negative numbers...stop at nothing?"<p class="message sent">*laughs* "Oh, Dad. You always have the best jokes."<p class=message>"I try my best. Speaking of math, have you been keeping up with your algebra homework?"<p class="message sent">"Yeah, I have been. It's not my favorite subject, but I'm getting the hang of it."<p class=message>"That's great to hear. You know, I used to be really good at math in high school. I even won a contest once."<p class="message sent">"Really? What kind of contest was it?"<p class=message>"It was a calculus competition. I won a trophy and everything."<p class="message sent">"Wow, Dad. I don't think I'll be winning any calculus trophies anytime soon."<p class=message>"Hey, you never know. You'll get there with enough practice."<p class="message sent">"Maybe. But for now, let's just enjoy the fresh air and sunshine."<p class=message>"Good idea, son.
