How may I assist you with your check-in process?<p class="message sent">Thank you, I have a reservation under the name of Johnson.<p class=message>Yes, I see that here in our system. May I have your passport and credit card, please?<p class="message sent">Sure, here they are.<p class=message>Thank you. Our check-in time is at 2 pm, and it's currently past that time. Would you like to leave your bags with us while you explore the city?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was hoping to take a nap since my flight was very early. Do you have any recommendations for a good spot to nap?<p class=message>Well, we have very comfortable beds in our rooms, but if you prefer, we have a lounge area on the second floor with a cozy sofa and dim lighting.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. Thank you for your help.<p class=message>You're welcome. Is there anything else you need assistance with?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. Do you know of any good restaurants nearby? I'm really craving Italian food.<p class=message>Absolutely. There's a great Italian restaurant just a few blocks away called La Rustica. They have delicious dishes and a great wine selection.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I'll definitely check it out. Thank you again for your help.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. If you need anything else during your stay, don't hesitate to ask. Enjoy your time in Canberra!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f092059-5e3f-46ae-ad18-49b8680a9d38.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
