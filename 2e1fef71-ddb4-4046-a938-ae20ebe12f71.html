Welcome to our restaurant. My name is Rachel and I'll be your server today. How can I help you?<p class="message sent">Hi Rachel! I'm excited to try some authentic New Orleans food. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Well, you can't go wrong with our gumbo or jambalaya. They're both classic dishes here in the Big Easy.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I've never had gumbo before. What's in it?<p class=message>Gumbo is a thick soup made with vegetables, meat, and seafood. It's usually served over rice. Our version has Andouille sausage, chicken, shrimp, and okra.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! I'll definitely have to try it.<p class=message>Great choice! And for your main course, I highly recommend our blackened catfish. It's seasoned with a blend of spices and pan-seared for a crispy coating.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds amazing. Can I substitute the side dish for something else?<p class=message>Of course! We have several options, including mac and cheese, red beans and rice, and coleslaw.<p class="message sent">I'll go with the red beans and rice. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class=message>You're welcome. And for dessert, I recommend our bread pudding with a whiskey sauce. It's a New Orleans classic.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great way to end the meal. I'll take it!<p class=message>Perfect! I'll put your order in right away. Anything else I can get for you in the meantime?<p class="message sent">Actually, can I try one of the local beers you have on tap?<p class=message>Of course! We have Abita Amber and NOLA Blonde. Which one would you like to try?<p class="message sent">I'll go with the NOLA Blonde. Thanks!<p class=message>Not a problem. I'll be right back with your beer and bread pudding. Enjoy!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2e1bb364-8e88-4cdf-b5a8-198b523ec8a5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
