Are you the soy milk maker?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! And you must be the pancake maker, right?<p class=message>Actually, I make traditional Chinese pancakes - they're called "Shao Bing."<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Well, I make fresh soy milk every morning, brewed from high-quality soybeans!<p class=message>That's great! I think our foods complement each other well.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's always nice when different cultures come together.<p class=message>Speaking of which, how long have you been making soy milk?<p class="message sent">I've been doing this for about 10 years now. It's a family tradition.<p class=message>And I've been making Shao Bing for about the same amount of time. It's a tricky art.<p class="message sent">Really? What's the hardest part?<p class=message>Getting the dough to the right consistency. It has to be chewy, but not too tough.<p class="message sent">I know what you mean. Making soy milk is just as tricky. It has to be creamy, but not too thick.<p class=message>It sounds like we have a lot in common!<p class="message sent">Absolutely! That's why I love working in this industry. There's always something new to learn.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. And the best part is seeing our customers enjoy our delicious and authentic foods.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's satisfying to know we're bringing a genuine taste of China to Japan.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1ea446ab-69e3-4072-a0b6-4ea21cf62b24.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
