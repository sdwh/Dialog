Can you explain what social engineering is?<p class=message>Sure, social engineering is when attackers use psychological manipulation to trick people into giving up sensitive information or performing actions that could compromise security.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So how does ISO 27001 help prevent social engineering attacks?<p class=message>It provides guidelines and best practices for identifying and mitigating social engineering risks in an organization.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Do you think it's effective?<p class=message>Definitely. It's a comprehensive approach to information security that covers all aspects of social engineering, including training employees, implementing security policies, and regularly assessing and monitoring risks.<p class="message sent">Wow, it sounds like a lot of work.<p class=message>It can be, but it's worth it to protect sensitive information and prevent costly security breaches.<p class="message sent">Have you ever implemented ISO 27001 in your company?<p class=message>Yes, we have. It's helped us improve our security posture and maintain our customers' trust in our services.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. Do you have any tips for getting started with ISO 27001?<p class=message>Start by conducting a thorough risk assessment and developing a roadmap for implementation. It's also important to involve all stakeholders and make sure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice. I'll keep that in mind if we decide to pursue ISO 27001.<p class=message>No problem. It's always better to be proactive when it comes to protecting sensitive information.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a46af7b3-e8f4-4b1d-b720-a57a8bedf3e6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
