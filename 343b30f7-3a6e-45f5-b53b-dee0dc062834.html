What process do you go through to ensure that it's safe for consumption?<p class="message sent">Firstly, we wash and slice the cabbage and add spices and seasoned fish sauce.

Do you have any tips for making great kimchi?<p class="message sent">Yes, cleanliness is key in kimchi making. You must make sure the containers and your hands are clean to avoid any contamination. And don't be afraid to experiment with different spice combinations.<p class=message>What happens when the kimchi is too spicy for some people?<p class="message sent">It's common for some people to find our kimchi spicy.
