How's the crispy chicken coming along for today's menu?<p class="message sent">Hey A! The chicken's turning out great. I've added some spices to give it an extra kick.<p class=message>That's fantastic. Our customers love the extra flavors. How about the onion rings?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I've made sure they're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They're perfect as a side dish.<p class=message>Great! I'm looking forward to trying them out. By the way, have we received any new orders for catering events?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a large order for a company event next week. They've requested our famous fried chicken and mac and cheese.<p class=message>That's excellent news. Let's make sure everything is delivered on time and in perfect condition.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'll make sure everything is prepared with care. Speaking of which, have you tried the new dipping sauce I made for the chicken?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'll be sure to try it. What's in it?<p class="message sent">It's a blend of honey mustard, BBQ sauce, and a bit of hot sauce. It's the perfect combination of tangy and sweet.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! I'll definitely recommend it to our customers. By the way, have we restocked on the chicken breading mix?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have enough for at least a week. And I've made sure to keep a backup stock as well.<p class=message>Great job keeping track of our inventory, B. You're a real asset to our team.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. It's my pleasure to work with such a great team and provide our customers with delicious food.<p class=message>Speaking of which, I think it's time for a taste test. Let's grab a piece of chicken and try out that dipping sauce!<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, A! Just let me grab a plate and we'll dig in.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8dc93c9c-fdd7-4ebb-9fbf-73fb5bcafb25.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
