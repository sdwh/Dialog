I heard you're interested in automating contract management?<p class="message sent message-content">Hey A, yeah, that's right. It's a bit of a headache dealing with multiple contracts manually.<p class="message received message-content">I totally get that. I'm an IT consultant and we've been helping companies automate a lot of their processes. Have you considered using a document management system?<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, I'm not sure. How can a system really help with contracts?<p class="message received message-content">Well, there are powerful tools that can extract information from contracts and automatically categorize them. Plus, you can set up workflows for approvals and changes.<p class="message sent message-content">Interesting. Do you have any recommendations for a system?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, there are a lot of options out there, but I highly recommend [insert system name]. It's widely recognized as a leader in document management and has a lot of customizable features.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds like it could be expensive, though.<p class="message received message-content">It can be, but think about the time saved from manually tracking all those contracts. It might end up being more cost-effective.<p class="message sent message-content">That's a good point. How long does it take to set up?<p class="message received message-content">It depends on the size of your company and the number of contracts you have, but we've worked with similar clients and it takes about a month of implementation and training.<p class="message sent message-content">Do we need to have an internal IT team to support it?<p class="message received message-content">Not at all. We offer ongoing support and maintenance, and the system is user-friendly enough that anyone can learn to use it.<p class="message sent message-content">Okay, I'm sold. Let's go ahead and set up a demo.<p class="message received message-content">Great! We'll have someone from our team reach out to set that up for you.<p class="message sent message-content">Thanks for the recommendation, A. It's been a productive discussion.<p class="message received message-content">My pleasure, B. It's always a pleasure to help streamline processes and improve efficiency.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=044b1ebc-1b58-447a-94a2-5d541401b6ac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
