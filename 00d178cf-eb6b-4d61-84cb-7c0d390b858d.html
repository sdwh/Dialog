Just got here to pick up the cattle for transport.<p class="message received message-content">Great, glad to hear it. So where are you taking them today?<p class="message sent message-content">Well, I've got a delivery scheduled for a meat processing plant in the next county over.<p class="message received message-content">Ah, I see. That should be a pretty smooth ride for you. Just watch out for those bumpy roads!<p class="message sent message-content">Will do. Say, have you ever driven one of these big rigs before?<p class="message received message-content">Ha, no thanks. I think I'll leave that to the professionals like you.<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, it takes a lot of skill and patience. But it's worth it all in the end.<p class="message received message-content">Definitely. So tell me, how's your family doing? I heard your wife started a new job.<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, she did. She's really enjoying it so far. I'm proud of her.<p class="message received message-content">That's great to hear. Speaking of jobs, we've got some new hires starting next week.<p class="message sent message-content">Really? Who are they?<p class="message received message-content">Just a few young guys from the nearby town who are looking for work. They seemed pretty eager to learn.<p class="message sent message-content">Well, that's good to hear. We could always use some fresh faces around here.<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely. And hey, once they're trained up, maybe we can take them out for a celebratory steak dinner!<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds like a plan to me, A. My treat!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=00cf1bc4-4087-446d-82d4-e5f959ebe0a1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
