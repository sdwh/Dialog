It's great to meet you. Have you tried the squid here before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's certainly a popular item on the menu.<p class=message>I ordered it for the first time today. I wasn't sure if I would like it, but it's really good. Have you found any particular way that you enjoy it?<p class="message sent">I like to eat it grilled with a squeeze of lemon juice. The flavor is really rich and delicious.<p class=message>That sounds great. I tried it fried with a side of garlic mayo, and it was amazing.<p class="message sent">Oh, the garlic mayo definitely takes it to the next level. I'll have to try that next time.<p class=message>It's nice to be able to try new things, especially when it comes to food. Squid may not be something I would normally order, but I'm glad I did.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I find it's always a pleasant surprise when you taste something you didn't expect to like and end up really enjoying it.<p class=message>That's so true. And it's always good to broaden our horizons and step out of our comfort zones, even if it's just with food.<p class="message sent">It can be a great way to learn about different cultures too. Squid is a popular dish in certain regions of the world.<p class=message>Really? I didn't know that. What other dishes do you think I should try?<p class="message sent">If you like seafood, I highly recommend the grilled octopus. It's another dish that people often find surprising in how flavorful it can be.<p class=message>Sounds intriguing. I'll definitely keep that in mind for next time. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem! Always happy to chat about food and try new things.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fbb47c1f-362e-459d-851f-e8325d04be6d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
