Where would you like to go today?<p class="message sent">Hi, just to a café on St Georges Terrace please.<p class=message>No problem. Do you come here often?<p class="message sent">Yes, I work nearby so I come here for lunch quite often.<p class=message>Oh that’s nice. Have you tried any new places lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I went to a great new Italian restaurant nearby last week.<p class=message>Sounds yummy, I'll have to check it out. Do you have any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Not really, just planning to relax and catch up on some reading. What about you?<p class=message>I think I'm going to take my family down to the beach, get some sun and try some surfing.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of fun. Have you surfed before?<p class=message>A few times, but I still fall off the board more than I stay on it!<p class="message sent">Oh dear, well practice makes perfect.<p class=message>That's what they say! How's your day been so far?<p class="message sent">It's been pretty good, just busy at work. How about you?<p class=message>A bit slow, but I like it that way. Just gives me more time to think.<p class="message sent">That's always good. Do you like being a taxi driver?<p class=message>Yeah, it's a great way to meet new people like you and to see different parts of the city.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. Perth is such a beautiful city.<p class=message>It definitely is. Have you been to any of the parks or gardens around here?<p class="message sent">Yeah, Kings Park is one of my favorite spots to go for a picnic or a walk.<p class=message>It's a beautiful area. I love going there too. Well, we're almost there. Is this the café you wanted to go to?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's the one. Thank you so much for the ride and the conversation.<p class=message>No problem at all. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=21d758a5-1b9e-47c2-82a7-bc2e87a473a6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
