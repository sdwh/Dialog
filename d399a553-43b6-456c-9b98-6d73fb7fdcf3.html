I can't seem to get my head around it.<p class=message>Sure thing. You know, they say that debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie.<p class="message sent">Ha! I never thought about it that way.<p class=message>Yeah, you have to look at all the clues and piece together what happened.<p class="message sent">Well, I'm definitely lost in this maze.<p class=message>Don't worry, I'll help you get out of it. It's important to remember that programming is all about problem solving.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and sometimes it's just trial and error until you find the solution.<p class=message>Exactly. But hey, at least we're working on our problem-solving skills!<p class="message sent">That's true. And we're also making something that's going to be useful to people.<p class=message>Yeah, it's always rewarding to know that your work will have a positive impact.<p class="message sent">And it's also fun to see your code come to life and work the way it should.<p class=message>Definitely. It's like watching a magic trick unfold.<p class="message sent">Speaking of magic tricks, have you heard about David Blaine's latest stunt?<p class=message>No, what is it?<p class="message sent">He's going to float over New York City with balloons!<p class=message>Wow, that's crazy. But hey, maybe he's using some Node.js magic to make it happen.<p class="message sent">Ha! You never know, maybe he's one of us.<p class=message>Alright, I think I found the problem in your code. Let's give it a go and see if it works now.<p class="message sent">You're a lifesaver, A. Thanks for your help.<p class=message>No problem, it's what teammates are for. Let's keep crushing this project!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d396c240-e64b-4a6d-be0c-e9831df2505b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
