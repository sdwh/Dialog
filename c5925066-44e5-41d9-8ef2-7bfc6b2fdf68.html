I noticed you're a chef at this restaurant. Do you mind if I ask you a question about seafood?<p class="message sent">Of course not! I'm always happy to talk about seafood. What do you want to know?<p class=message>Well, as a scuba diver, I know that some of the best seafood comes from the ocean. Do you have any tips on how to get the freshest seafood?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! The key is to buy seafood that was just caught. It's especially important for shellfish and other delicate seafood.<p class=message>That makes sense. Do you have any recommendations for where to get the best seafood in this area?<p class="message sent">Definitely the local fish market. They have a great selection of seafood that's fresh from the boats.<p class=message>Oh, I've never been there before. Do you have any tips for shopping there?<p class="message sent">Sure. Always ask what's the freshest catch of the day. And if you're buying whole fish, look for clear eyes and bright red gills.<p class=message>Those are great tips. What are some of your favorite seafood dishes to cook?<p class="message sent">I love making grilled shrimp with garlic butter. And our seafood risotto is always a hit with customers.<p class=message>Yum, both of those sound amazing. I'll have to try them next time I visit your restaurant.<p class="message sent">Please do! And if you ever catch any fresh seafood yourself, feel free to bring it in and we'll cook it up for you.<p class=message>That's very kind of you. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for chatting with me about seafood!<p class="message sent">Anytime! It's always great to talk to someone who shares a passion for fresh seafood.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5918da5-85ef-4a8b-b443-41ae47e91693.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
