Welcome to the Golden Gate Bridge. Are you enjoying the view?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Yes, I am. The scenery is breathtaking, and being on the bridge is amazing!<p class=message>That's fantastic! Did you know that this bridge is one of the most photographed landmarks in the world?<p class="message sent">Really? I can understand why though; it's absolutely stunning. I wonder how many photos are taken each day.<p class=message>Well, according to some sources, it's estimated at around 10,000 photos per day.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive! I think I have already taken a dozen photos myself, and I've only been here for 10 minutes.<p class=message>Haha! Don't worry, you're not the only one. I see tourists taking photos all day long, rain or shine.<p class="message sent">Speaking of rain, what happens to the bridge during storms? Does it ever close down?<p class=message>Yes, it does. The bridge has to be closed if the winds are blowing at over 75 miles per hour, or if there is fog that reduces visibility to less than a quarter mile.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. It would be dangerous to keep it open under such conditions.<p class=message>Exactly. Safety is a top priority here. But thankfully, today is a beautiful day, and we can enjoy the view without any distractions.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Thank you for driving me here and sharing all this interesting information with me.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. I'm glad you're having a good time. Do you want me to stop somewhere for a closer look or keep driving?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let's keep driving for now. I don't want to miss anything from the window!<p class=message>Alright, sounds good! Enjoy the ride.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b767e36e-0183-4030-8e54-96c61bbee77b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
