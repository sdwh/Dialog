It's great to see you in our clinic today. What brings you here?<p class="message sent">Hi, Doctor A! I'm feeling a bit under the weather lately, and I want to make sure everything's okay.<p class=message>Alright. Let's start with your weight and height. Could you step on the scale and stand against the wall?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. *steps on the scale* What's your guess?<p class=message>Hmm, I'd say 150 pounds?<p class="message sent">Nope, higher. *laughs* 170 pounds.<p class=message>Ah, my bad. You're carrying it well though. *chuckles* Now, let's check your blood pressure. How's work been lately?<p class="message sent">It's been busy, but I'm managing. The usual stress, you know.<p class=message>I hear you. That could be a contributing factor to your high blood pressure reading. Have you tried any stress-relieving activities?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been doing some yoga at home. It really helps me relax.<p class=message>Excellent. Keep that up. Now, how about your diet? Have you been eating your fruits and veggies?<p class="message sent">Uhm, not as much as I should. *sheepish grin*<p class=message>*smirks* That's something we should work on then. Remember, an apple a day keeps the doctor away.<p class="message sent">Got it. I'll make sure to hit the produce section on my next grocery run.<p class=message>Perfect. Alright, B, everything else seems to be in check. Just keep doing what you're doing and come back for a follow-up in a few weeks.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Doc A. You're the best.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Take care and stay healthy!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a8f9b264-430b-4ea4-95de-e707679a9a62.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
