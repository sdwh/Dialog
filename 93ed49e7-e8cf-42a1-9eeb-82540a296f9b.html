How are you feeling today? What brings you in for a checkup?<p class="message sent">Hi Doctor A! I'm feeling alright, just some mild coughing and a bit of a sore throat. I wanted to get it checked before it gets worse.<p class=message>Alright, we'll check that out. Have you been taking any medication or home remedies to help with your symptoms?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been taking some cough syrup and drinking lots of hot tea with honey. It's been helping somewhat.<p class=message>Great to hear that. Now, let's take a look at your throat. Open wide and say "ahh".<p class="message sent">Ahh...<p class=message>Very good. Hmm, I see some redness and swelling in your throat. It looks like a viral infection. We'll need to prescribe you some antibiotics to clear it up.<p class="message sent">Alright, that sounds good. Do you think I'll be better in time for the weekend?<p class=message>Most likely, but you'll need to finish the full course of medication for it to be effective. And make sure to rest and stay hydrated too.<p class="message sent">Got it, thank you for the advice Doctor. By the way, have you watched any good movies lately?<p class=message>(laughs) That's a good question B. Actually, yes. I saw a really funny comedy last night called "Game Night". Have you seen it?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. But I do love comedies. I'll check it out this weekend after I recover.<p class=message>Sounds like a good plan. Alright, let me write that prescription for you and you'll be on your way. Take care and get well soon B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=93ed345a-386a-4d95-99ca-888423e97c8f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
