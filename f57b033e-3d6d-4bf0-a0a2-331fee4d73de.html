We've sold out of our signature bubble milk tea once again.<p class=message>That's amazing! Today, I'm trying out a new recipe for xiaolongbao. Care to taste test for me?<p class="message sent">Of course! I love xiaolongbao, especially when it's fresh and steaming hot.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. This batch is made with minced pork and shrimp filling, and I added some finely chopped bamboo shoots for extra crunch.<p class="message sent">Mmm, the aroma is heavenly. And the texture is perfect â€“ not too thick or too thin.<p class=message>Thanks, I'm glad you like it. What's new with the drinks today?<p class="message sent">I just made a batch of matcha latte with oat milk for a customer who's lactose intolerant. It turned out surprisingly well!<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. How did you come up with that idea?<p class="message sent">I did some research online and found that many people prefer oat milk as a substitute for dairy milk in their drinks. So, I decided to give it a try.<p class=message>You're always so innovative. I think our customers appreciate that about us. By the way, have you tried that new peanut butter smoothie from the competitor down the street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class=message>Personally, I think it's too sweet and heavy on the peanut butter. But, I can see why some people might like it. It's always good to keep an eye on the competition, though. Speaking of which, have you seen the latest trend on social media about pancakes that look like animals?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! I was thinking about trying to make some for our shop. Do you think it would be a hit with our customers?<p class=message>Definitely! We could make some panda-shaped pancakes with chocolate chips for eyes and nose, and strawberry slices for ears. Or, maybe some piglet-shaped ones with bacon bits for ears and a whipped cream snout.<p class="message sent">That sounds adorable! You're full of great ideas, A.<p class=message>Aw, thanks! I think we make a pretty good team, B.<p class="message sent">I agree. Here's to more delicious and creative collaborations in the future!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f571b25e-89ac-4e86-8781-363a98f7cdd1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
