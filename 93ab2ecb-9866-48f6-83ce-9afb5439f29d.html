It's going to be a game changer for people who want to make their homes more efficient and convenient.<p class=message>That's awesome. What kind of features are we thinking of including?<p class="message sent">Well, we want to make sure it has voice command technology and the ability to control everything from one central hub.<p class=message>I love that idea. It'll be like having our own personal assistant.<p class="message sent">Exactly! And we're also thinking of including smart security features like facial or voice recognition to prevent break-ins.<p class=message>That's a great idea. We definitely want to make sure our customers feel secure in their homes.<p class="message sent">And of course, we have to make sure it's easy to use for everyone, not just tech-savvy people.<p class=message>Definitely. It shouldn't be intimidating or too complicated to set up.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We want people to feel empowered by this system, not frustrated by it.<p class=message>Hey, do you think we could have a feature that automatically turns off the lights when you're not in the room?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's actually on our list! It'll help save energy and electricity, which is always a good thing.<p class=message>This system is going to be a hit. I can already see people lining up to buy it.<p class="message sent">Just wait until they see the design of the central hub. It looks like something out of a sci-fi movie!<p class=message>I can't wait to see it all come together. This is going to be a really exciting project to work on.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=93a99a77-70a2-48d6-8620-606942f648e7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
