How about you, server?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. I'm excited to learn about the dishes we'll be preparing today!<p class="message sent">Ah, we'll be making five French dishes. Are you familiar with them?<p class=message>Yes, I've had some exposure to French cuisine before. But it's always great to learn more.<p class="message sent">That's great. Today, we'll be making escargots, bouillabaisse, coq au vin, beef bourguignon, and crème brûlée.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like quite the lineup. Which one is your favorite to prepare?<p class="message sent">As a chef, they are all equally enjoyable to prepare. But if I had to choose, I would say beef bourguignon.<p class=message>Interesting choice. How long have you been preparing French cuisine?<p class="message sent">I've been cooking professionally for about 15 years now, with about 5 years specifically focused on French cuisine.<p class=message>That's impressive. And how about pairing these dishes with wine?<p class="message sent">For our menu today, we have chosen a red wine that pairs well with all of the dishes. It's a nice Bordeaux – do you like red wine?<p class=message>Yes, I do. I think it'll complement the dishes really nicely.<p class="message sent">I agree. Do you have any questions about the dishes before we get started?<p class=message>Not at the moment, Chef. But as we cook, I'm sure I'll have plenty of questions to ask!<p class="message sent">Of course, feel free to ask anything you'd like. Let's get started – we have a lot of cooking to do!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6ec23afa-0829-4756-8a38-88ce04cce68a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
