What's on our shopping list for today?<p class="message sent message-content">Hey, A! Today we'll be shopping for the freshest local ingredients to cook some traditional Cape Town dishes. We'll start with some West Coast oysters, then grab some biltong and droewors for snacks, and finish with some Cape seafood.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds great! I can't wait to try my hand at cooking some seafood dishes. What's your favorite seafood recipe from this region?<p class="message sent message-content">It's got to be the Cape Malay seafood curry – it's a blend of spices, onion, garlic, tomato, and coconut milk. We'll need some fresh fish, calamari, and prawns to make it.<p class="message received message-content">Yum, that sounds delicious. Oh, look over there – those bright red Cape gooseberries look so juicy.<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely! They have a sweet and tangy taste that would work well in a dessert. We can add them to a pavlova, which is a popular South African treat.<p class="message received message-content">Pavlova it is! I'll grab some cream and we can mix it with the gooseberries to create a topping. What other ingredients do we need for a pavlova?<p class="message sent message-content">We'll need some egg whites, sugar, cornstarch, vinegar, and fresh fruit – like mango and kiwi. It's a bit tricky to make, but I'm sure you'll do great.<p class="message received message-content">Challenge accepted! Let's hurry and finish our shopping so we can get back to the kitchen and start cooking.<p class="message sent message-content">Alright, we're almost done here. Just a few more items – some samp and beans for a side dish and some rooibos tea for a refreshing drink.<p class="message received message-content">Perfect! Now let's head back to your kitchen and get cooking.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds like a plan. I'll show you how to properly clean and prepare the seafood while you start on the curry. Let's get cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=07161d28-7924-4054-a00d-bc2c5854bdcd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
