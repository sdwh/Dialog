How long have you been driving taxis?<p class="message sent">Good morning, sir! I have been driving taxis for over 8 years now. It's been an enjoyable experience.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Have you ever driven to Los Angeles before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's a popular destination, and I always love the driving experience.<p class=message>That's wonderful. By the way, do you have any favorite songs to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm a big fan of classic rock. I love listening to bands like Queen, Led Zeppelin, and The Beatles.<p class=message>Those are some great choices. I'm more of a hip-hop fan myself. Do you like any hip-hop artists?<p class="message sent">Not really, but hey, everyone has their own taste in music!<p class=message>Haha, that's true. So, what's the most interesting thing that has happened during your time as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Once, I had a passenger who wanted to go on a scavenger hunt across the city. We spent the whole day driving around, and it was so much fun.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a unique experience. Speaking of unique experiences, have you tried any interesting foods in Los Angeles?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've tried Korean BBQ and it was delicious. Have you tried it?<p class=message>Yes, I have! I love Korean BBQ too. When we get to Los Angeles, let's have some for lunch!<p class="message sent">Great idea! I know a really great spot. What are your favorite Korean BBQ dishes?<p class=message>I love bulgogi and galbi, but honestly, everything is delicious!<p class="message sent">Agreed! It's hard to go wrong with Korean BBQ. We should probably start thinking about where you'd like to be dropped off. Where are you headed in Los Angeles?<p class=message>I'll be heading to the convention center for a work conference.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a great spot. You'll have a great time there. Is there anything else you'd like me to know before we arrive?<p class=message>No, that's all. I just appreciate your great driving skills, and I'm excited to enjoy some delicious Korean BBQ later!<p class="message sent">Thank you for the kind words, sir. I'm excited for it too. We should be there in about 10 minutes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4bca4013-d568-4f92-a44d-f05fb0e4fe15.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
