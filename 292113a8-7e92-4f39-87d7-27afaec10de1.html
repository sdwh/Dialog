I'm feeling pretty good today, thank you very much.<p class=message>Well, that's wonderful to hear. Have you had your breakfast yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. The oatmeal was delicious, as always.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else I can do for you this morning?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was wondering if you could help me with a crossword puzzle. I'm stuck on a few clues.<p class=message>Sure, I'd be happy to help. Let's take a look.<p class="message sent">Thank you. Let's see, the clue is "a small, furry animal with a long tail and sharp claws."<p class=message>That would be a squirrel.<p class="message sent">Ah, of course! I should have known that one. And how about this one - "a popular flower often associated with love and romance."<p class=message>That would be a rose.<p class="message sent">Ah ha, got it. Thank you so much, Nurse A. You're a lifesaver.<p class=message>No problem at all, Mr. B. It's my pleasure to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class="message sent">No, I think that's all for now. But thank you again, Nurse A.<p class=message>You're welcome. Have a lovely day, Mr. B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=291f944a-5528-44e7-bc72-5b91dae12a8b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
