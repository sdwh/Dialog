Yeah, I remember him.<p class=message>That's the one! He seems like a nice guy though.<p class="message sent">Yeah but he still has a lot to learn. I caught him trying to send an email without attaching the file yesterday.<p class=message>Oh no, I hope it wasn't anything important.<p class="message sent">Just the weekly report that the boss specifically asked for. But luckily I saved the day and reminded him about the attachment.<p class=message>You're a lifesaver, B. I'm sure the boss appreciated it.<p class="message sent">I hope so. Speaking of the boss, have you noticed how he always has his stapler chained to his desk?<p class=message>Yeah, I noticed that too. Is he afraid someone is going to steal it?<p class="message sent">I have no idea. Maybe it's his prized possession.<p class=message>Haha, who knows? Speaking of office supplies, have you ever been tempted to take a bunch of sticky notes and cover someone's desk with them?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Are you kidding? That's my idea of a good time.<p class=message>(laughs) We should definitely do that to someone one day.<p class="message sent">Definitely, I'm in.<p class=message>Hey, it's almost lunch time. Do you want to grab a sandwich with me?<p class="message sent">Sure, sounds good. I'll meet you at the caf√© in 10 minutes.<p class=message>Perfect, let's go.<p class="message sent">(jokingly) But you're paying, right?<p class=message>(laughs) Nice try, B. You're paying for your own sandwich.<p class="message sent">Alright, you got me. Let's go.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c8e59b52-b7ff-4d9f-a48e-21febb205ba6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
