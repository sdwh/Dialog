How are you doing today, Nurse B?<p class="message sent">I'm doing pretty well. How about yourself, Dr. A?<p class=message>Can't complain. Now, let's get started with the check-up. How are the vitals looking?<p class="message sent">Blood pressure is normal, heart rate is steady, and oxygen saturation is at 98%.<p class=message>Great. And how are the stress levels lately? Any stressful events in the past week?<p class="message sent">Well, actually, I did lose my keys and was locked out of my apartment for a few hours yesterday. But other than that, nothing too crazy.<p class=message>Ah, I hate when that happens. But I'm glad you're keeping stress levels low overall. Anything else you've noticed that might be worth mentioning?<p class="message sent">Actually, I did start running again last week. I've been experiencing some shin splints, but I've been trying to stretch and take it easy.<p class=message>Ah, got it. Well, make sure to keep your muscles well-rested and maybe invest in some good running shoes. And of course, keep up the exercise routine! Anything else you want to ask or mention?<p class="message sent">No, I don't think so. Thanks for looking out for me, Dr. A!<p class=message>Of course, happy to help. Keep staying healthy, Nurse B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=af69c660-f031-4afa-9aa6-07d7ae3fcdc8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
