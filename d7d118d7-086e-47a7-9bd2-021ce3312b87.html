Nice to see you here at the port. Are you looking for some fresh seafood?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Yes, I am. I have been searching for the best seafood for my restaurant’s menu. Can you help me with that?<p class=message>Of course, I can! As a fisherman, I am an expert in this field. What kind of seafood are you looking for?<p class="message sent">I want to include some of the local favorites like prawns, clams, and squid in my menu. Can you provide me your best catches for these?<p class=message>Definitely! I have caught some big-sized prawns and fresh squid early this morning, and my fellow fishermen just came back with baskets full of clams. Want me to show them to you?<p class="message sent">Sure, lead the way!<p class=message>Look at these beauties! I assure you, they are the freshest ones you can find in town.<p class="message sent">Wow, they look amazing! I can already imagine them in my menu. Can you tell me more about the seafood you have and how they taste?<p class=message>Sure, prawns have a sweet and succulent taste, while squid has a mild and delicate flavor. Clams, on the other hand, have a unique briny taste that is perfect for soups or pasta dishes.<p class="message sent">That's great! Now, let's talk about the price. How much do you charge for each kilogram?<p class=message>Well, I'll give you a good price since you are my friend. Let’s settle for $20 per kilogram for prawns, $15 for squid, and $10 for clams. How does that sound?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me! I'll take 10 kilograms of prawns, 5 kilograms of squid, and 8 kilograms of clams. When can you deliver them to my restaurant?<p class=message>You got it! I'll deliver them to you tomorrow morning, first thing. Is that fine with you?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's perfect. And please don't forget to visit my restaurant to try the dishes you helped me with. They should be delicious!<p class=message>Of course! I am excited to see my catches in your restaurant's menu. See you later, B!<p class="message sent">Take care, A.
