Look at these beautiful Japanese confections! Are you excited to learn how to make them?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I can't wait to capture their beauty in photographs. What ingredient is this green powder made of?<p class=message>That's matcha, finely ground green tea leaves. It's a popular ingredient in traditional Japanese sweets.<p class="message sent">I love matcha lattes, but I've never tried it in a dessert before. What's the flavor like?<p class=message>It has a rich and earthy taste, but it's also slightly bitter. We'll need to balance it out with some sweetness.<p class="message sent">Got it, I'll be sure to capture the process in my photographs! What's first on the agenda?<p class=message>We'll start with making the koshi-an, a sweet red bean paste filling. It's a staple in many Japanese sweets.<p class="message sent">Cool, I have my camera ready. How do we make it?<p class=message>We just need to cook the beans until they soften, then mash them and sweeten it with sugar. Easy, right?<p class="message sent">Simple enough, but I have a feeling it'll take a lot of patience to get it just right.<p class=message>That's the beauty of Japanese confectionery. It requires a lot of attention to detail, but it's worth it in the end.<p class="message sent">I'm excited to see the finished product. I bet it'll not only look amazing, but taste great too!<p class=message>Absolutely, the combination of delicate flavors and beautiful designs is what makes Japanese confections so special.<p class="message sent">And it's great that we get to learn from a master chef in Kyoto. This is definitely an experience to remember.<p class=message>You're right, we're fortunate to be able to soak up the culture and bring back new skills to share with our friends back home.<p class="message sent">Exactly, our journey to becoming Japanese confectionary wizards begins now!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bf342dd1-3060-4d86-b37e-0943e9c1bdca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
