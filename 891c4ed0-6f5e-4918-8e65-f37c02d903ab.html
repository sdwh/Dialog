I hope you all had a great night's rest. Today, we are going to visit the famous Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa.<p class="message sent">That's right, A. Senso-ji is one of the oldest and most significant Buddhist temples in Tokyo. It was founded in the 7th century and has gone through several reconstructions since then.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive! What are some must-see spots in the temple?<p class="message sent">Definitely the Kaminarimon Gate, with its massive red lantern and guards statues called Nio-mon, they are seen as the protectors of the temple.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. And what about shopping at Nakamise Dori?<p class="message sent">Of course! Nakamise is a traditional shopping street with local souvenir shops and food stalls that offer delicious sweets and snacks.<p class=message>That's great. I also heard that there's a fortune-telling spot in the temple. Can you tell us more about it?<p class="message sent">Yes, Omikuji is a fun and interesting experience. You shake a container until a stick comes out, match it with a numbered drawer, and then find your fortune written on the slip of paper inside.<p class=message>Amazing! I think everyone is looking forward to that. Thank you, B, for sharing this valuable information. I'll make sure to take good care of everyone and ensure we have a great time. Let's go!<p class="message sent">Yes, let's go, A! I'm excited to see everyone enjoy the beauty of Senso-ji with a little fun along the way.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=891b0060-f556-4cf4-89ae-fa3e8c54a9f0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
