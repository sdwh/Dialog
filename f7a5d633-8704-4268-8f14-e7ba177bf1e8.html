How have you been?<p class="message sent">Hello, A! I've been doing fine, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too. So, I'd like to discuss a matter with you. We've been facing some issues with our current express mail vendor. I think it's high time we start looking for a replacement.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. Do you have any particular vendor in mind?<p class=message>Yes, I was thinking of trying out FedEx. They seem to have a great track record and offer competitive rates.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a good idea. I'll start looking into their services and compare them to our current vendor.<p class=message>Great. Also, it would be good to get the opinion of our team. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We can gather feedback from employees to help us make a decision.<p class=message>Excellent. Let's make sure we do our due diligence and weigh all the pros and cons before making a final decision.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I'll keep you updated on my findings.<p class=message>Thanks, B. Your efficiency and attention to detail are much appreciated.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's my pleasure to help out. Is there anything else I can do for you?<p class=message>Not at the moment. But I'll be sure to let you know if there are any other tasks that need your attention.<p class="message sent">Alright, sounds good. Have a great day, A!<p class=message>You too, B. Take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f7a4dabe-19a9-498f-a9bb-375ba95fada0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
