Nice to meet you, B. You make the coffee, right?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. Yes, that's correct. It's great to meet you too! What do you have planned for the afternoon tea menu today?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking we could make some delicious mille-feuille with fresh berries and cream. And maybe some mini macarons in different flavors like rose, lemon, and lavender. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic! For the coffee, how about we offer a specialty latte with a hint of vanilla and cinnamon? It would go perfectly with the mille-feuille.<p class=message>Sounds like a great idea. And how about a cold brew with a dash of caramel and milk? It should complement the mini macarons quite well.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I think we should also try a new flavor of coffee today, like a hazelnut latte. It's really popular these days.<p class=message>Yes, that's a good call. We should definitely give it a try. By the way, I tasted your cold brew yesterday and it was amazing.<p class="message sent">Thank you! I'm glad you liked it. We should work together more often, A. It seems we make a great team.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Speaking of teamwork, have you seen the new espresso machine in the back? It's supposed to make the best espresso shots in town.<p class="message sent">Really? I haven't had a chance to check it out yet. Let's give it a go together later.<p class=message>Sure, sounds like a plan! Oh, and before I forget, have you tried making latte art before? I can show you some cool techniques I learned.<p class="message sent">I've tried a few times, but I'm definitely not an expert. That would be awesome, A. You're so talented!<p class=message>Thank you! I'm happy to share my skills. We can make some beautiful designs for the customers' coffee cups.<p class="message sent">They would love that. Alright, let's get started on prepping for the afternoon tea service. We have a lot to prepare!<p class=message>Yes, lots of work to do but I'm excited to collaborate with you and create something delicious for our customers. Let's get to it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=673f22f1-e4b6-422c-8e43-6a881ea9a673.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
