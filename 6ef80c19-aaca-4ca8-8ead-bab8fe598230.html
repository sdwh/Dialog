I am Dr. A, your attending physician for today's check-up. How are you feeling?<p class="message sent">Good day, Dr. A! I am feeling much better now. Thank you for asking.<p class=message>That's great to hear! How long has it been since you've been feeling better?<p class="message sent">About three days, doctor. My cough and colds have subsided, and my fever has gone down.<p class=message>I see. It seems that the medication I prescribed you is working. Do you have any other concerns?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have a bit of a headache. Could you recommend something for me?<p class=message>Of course, B. Just try to rest and stay hydrated. You can also take some paracetamol for your headache.<p class="message sent">Thank you, doctor. I'll try that.<p class=message>You're welcome. By the way, have you tried any of the food served here in the hospital?<p class="message sent">Not yet, doctor. Is there something you would recommend?<p class=message>The hospital's chicken soup is quite delicious. It might help with your colds too.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely try that, then. Thank you for the recommendation, doctor.<p class=message>No problem, B. Don't hesitate to call me or any of the hospital staff if you need anything further.<p class="message sent">Will do, doctor.
