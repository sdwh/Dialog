Where can I take you?<p class=message>Can you please take me to Manila? I have some business there.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, Manila it is! It's a beautiful city, have you been there before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. But it's always nice to go back and see some new places.<p class="message sent">That's true! Did you know that Manila has some of the best food in the Philippines?<p class=message>Really? I didn't know that. What kind of food do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Oh, there's so much to choose from! You have to try the adobo, sisig, and halo-halo. Trust me, they're all delicious!<p class=message>I'll make sure to try those. So, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for about 10 years now. It's been my main source of income ever since.<p class=message>That's quite impressive. Do you enjoy driving?<p class="message sent">I do actually. I get to meet all kinds of interesting people like you and I get to see all parts of the city.<p class=message>That's awesome. How do you deal with heavy traffic?<p class="message sent">I just turn up the radio and take it easy. It comes with the job, you know?<p class=message>Haha, yes I can imagine. Have you ever had any crazy passengers?<p class="message sent">Oh, I have a lot of stories about that! But I try not to let them get to me. It's all part of the job.<p class=message>I can imagine. What's the craziest thing that's ever happened to you while driving?<p class="message sent">One time, a girl forgot her wallet and offered to pay me with her pet snake. I politely declined, of course.<p class=message>Haha, that's insane! Thank goodness I won't be offering any snakes as payment.<p class="message sent">Haha, indeed. We're almost there, by the way. Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>No, that's it. Thank you for the pleasant conversation and the smooth ride.<p class="message sent">You're very welcome! Have a wonderful time in Manila!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ef0e2387-8e2f-4777-a65f-2006bfcfb109.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
