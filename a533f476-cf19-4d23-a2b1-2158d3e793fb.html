What brings you to this flight?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm B, an enterprise consultant. I'm just returning from a business trip. And you?<p class=message>I'm a senior consultant. I'm on my way to attend a conference on business strategies.<p class="message sent">Interesting! I'm also specializing in business strategies. What's the conference about, if you don't mind me asking?<p class=message>It's about the future of business management in the digital age. How about yours?<p class="message sent">I just attended a summit on innovation in the food industry. It was great to learn about new trends and technologies.<p class=message>That sounds fun! Do you think the food industry is going through a digital revolution too?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Data and technology play a much bigger role than before in the food industry. For example, using AI for predicting food trends.<p class=message>Wow, I never thought of that! In my field, we use data for decision-making all the time. But using AI for predicting food trends is a game-changer.<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely. Speaking of AI, how do you see it impacting business strategies in general?<p class=message>I think AI will help companies to optimize decision-making and solve problems quickly. It will also enable businesses to personalize customer experiences better.<p class="message sent">Completely agree. I believe that along with AI, ethics should also be given high priority in business decision-making.<p class=message>Yes, I couldn't agree more. Ethical dilemmas can arise while using and implementing technology in business, and companies should be careful to ensure they are doing the right thing.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It was great talking to you about this topic.<p class=message>Likewise, it's always good to exchange thoughts with someone from a different industry. Maybe we can grab a coffee after landing and continue our conversation?<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Looking forward to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a52dfc39-ec56-4f6c-858c-9492ae935e38.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
