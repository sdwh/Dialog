Are you excited to explore the city?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I've heard so much about Melbourne's history and culture.<p class=message>Well, you're in luck. Melbourne is rich in both. Did you know that it was once the capital of Australia?<p class="message sent">Really? I had no idea.<p class=message>Yes! Melbourne was the capital from 1901 to 1927 before it was moved to Canberra. Have you tried any Aussie food yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I had some kangaroo meat for dinner last night.<p class=message>Oh, that's great! Australians love their meat. Have you heard of Vegemite?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have, but I've never tried it before.<p class=message>It's an acquired taste. Australians usually spread it on toast or crackers. Want to try it?<p class="message sent">Sure, why not?<p class=message>*hands Traveler B a piece of toast with Vegemite* Here you go. Do you like it?<p class="message sent">*takes a bite* Hmm, it's definitely unique, but I don't hate it.<p class=message>That's usually the reaction I get from first-timers. Moving on to some history, did you know that Melbourne was founded by John Batman?<p class="message sent">Batman? Like the superhero?<p class=message>*laughs* No, not quite. He was an explorer who settled in Melbourne with a group of people in 1835. They bought the land from the local Indigenous Australians.<p class="message sent">Interesting. What else can you tell me about Melbourne's history?<p class=message>Well, Melbourne was also the site of the famous Eureka Rebellion, which was a defining moment in Australian democracy.<p class="message sent">I've never heard of that before. What was it about?<p class=message>Basically, it was a protest by gold miners who were tired of being oppressed by the government. They created a flag with the Southern Cross and fought for their rights. The rebellion failed, but it paved the way for future reforms.<p class="message sent">Wow, I didn't know Melbourne had such a rich and rebellious history. Thanks for sharing that with me!<p class=message>You're welcome! Melbourne has a lot of hidden gems that are just waiting to be discovered. I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2295276b-4530-4271-8669-f59700c6c7b5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
