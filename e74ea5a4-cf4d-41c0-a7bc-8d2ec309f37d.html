I'm glad you could come to our farm today.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Mr. A. Thank you for having me. What animals are we checking up on today?<p class=message>Well, we have a couple of cows and a dozen sheep that need to be looked at. I've noticed a few of them have been acting a bit off lately.<p class="message sent">Not a problem. Let's start with the cows. Can you tell me a bit about their feeding schedule and habits?<p class=message>Sure. We feed them twice a day, in the morning and at night. They all seem to have a good appetite and drink plenty of water.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. Now, let's take a closer look at each cow.<p class=message>How about the sheep? Any specific concerns about them?<p class="message sent">Just some routine check-ups, but I'll keep an eye out for anything unusual.<p class=message>Thank you, Dr. B. We take the health of our animals seriously, and we appreciate your expertise.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure, Mr. A. I always enjoy visiting farms and seeing all the animals. It's a nice change of pace from my busy clinic.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have you had any interesting cases lately?<p class="message sent">Just last week, I had to treat a llama who had gotten tangled up in some fencing. She's doing much better now, though.<p class=message>(laughs) You never know what you're going to get with animals, do you?<p class="message sent">Absolutely not. It's always an adventure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e74a7729-c971-4a35-9772-8a367946f207.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
