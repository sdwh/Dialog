It's like a laundry list of things we need to fix!<p class=message>Haha, yeah it's always interesting to see how many little holes there are to patch up.<p class="message sent">Definitely. But I have to say, some of these findings are pretty amusing.<p class=message>Oh, like what?<p class="message sent">Like the fact that our system was vulnerable to the "heartbleed" bug from like seven years ago? It's a little embarrassing.<p class=message>Yikes, yeah that's definitely one we should have fixed ages ago. But at least we're catching it now.<p class="message sent">For sure. But how are we going to prioritize these fixes? There are so many things to patch.<p class=message>Well, we can start by addressing the most critical issues with the highest severity scores first. And then work our way down from there.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. And I assume we'll need to coordinate with other teams to make sure we're not causing any disruptions.<p class=message>Yes, definitely. It's a team effort to ensure everything is secure.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, have you ever heard of a "hackathon"?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. It's like a marathon of hacking, right?<p class="message sent">Exactly! I was thinking we could host one and invite other departments to participate. It'd be a great way to raise awareness and test our defenses.<p class=message>That's a fun idea. We could even have prizes for the winners.<p class="message sent">Ha, yeah. We may not be able to offer millions like the black hats, but it'd still be a fun way to incentivize!<p class=message>Agreed. And who knows, maybe we'll even discover something before the bad guys do!<p class="message sent">Fingers crossed!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1bada9e7-3689-4a32-83e0-9474cdc41fb3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
