It's pretty challenging but also really fun!<p class=message>Oh I've heard of that one! How far have you gotten?<p class="message sent">I'm stuck on level 7 at the moment. It's driving me crazy.<p class=message>Haha, I know the feeling. Have you tried looking for any hints online?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but still no luck. I guess I'm just not good at puzzles.<p class=message>Don't worry, it takes some practice. Maybe we can play together sometime and I'll give you some tips.<p class="message sent">That would be great! By the way, have you tried out that new game that just came out?<p class=message>Which game?<p class="message sent">It's called "Among Us". You basically have to find out who is the imposter on a spaceship before they kill everyone.<p class=message>Oh that sounds interesting. I'll have to check it out. Is it free to play?<p class="message sent">Yup, it's free on mobile devices. Let me know if you want to play together sometime!<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Do you have any tips on what I should do first?<p class="message sent">Stick with a group to increase your chances of survival, but also keep an eye out for anyone acting suspiciously. It's all about the strategy!<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. I'm excited to try it out!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=35904330-3345-4af1-ba10-7cd323d5e536.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
