What would you like?<p class=message>Do you have any tea?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a variety of teas. Would you like green tea or black tea?<p class=message>I'll have the green tea, please.<p class="message sent">Great choice! Would you like it hot or iced?<p class=message>Hot please, it's a bit chilly in here.<p class="message sent">No problem, I'll bring it to you shortly. And for you, sir? Would you like a drink as well?<p class="message sent">Yes, I think I'll go for a beer, please.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Would you prefer a light beer or something with more body?<p class="message sent">I think I'll go for something with more body.<p class="message sent">Perfect choice. We have a selection of IPAs and stouts. Which one sounds better to you?<p class="message sent">The IPA, please.<p class="message sent">Great choice! I'll bring it over as soon as possible.<p class=message>I'm curious, what's the most popular drink on the flight?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough one. I'd say it's a pretty even split between soda, water, and coffee.<p class="message sent">Wow, I'm surprised coffee isn't the most popular.<p class="message sent">Well, it definitely comes in at a close fourth place. A lot of people like to have a nice cup of coffee on a long flight.<p class=message>I can't imagine drinking coffee before trying to get some sleep on a plane.<p class="message sent">Ah, that's fair. For those who want to sleep, we usually recommend something decaf or herbal, like our chamomile tea.<p class="message sent">That sounds great, maybe I'll try that on our next flight.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We're always here to help you choose the perfect beverage for your flight.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a3081c8e-1741-4695-a8bd-0291950d8587.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
