What's up?<p class=message>I wanted to talk to you about our boss, Mr. Liu, and the meeting we had this morning.<p class="message sent">Oh boy, what did he say this time?<p class=message>Well, you know how he is, he always has great ideas but sometimes they're a little off the wall.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know what you mean. Did he want to do something crazy again?<p class=message>Actually, he wants us to have a company picnic next week.<p class="message sent">Ha! That's not so crazy, but it's a little short notice. Does he expect us to plan it all?<p class=message>No, he's already booked a park and a caterer. All we have to do is show up and have fun.<p class="message sent">Well, that sounds like a nice change of pace. Did he say what kind of activities there will be?<p class=message>He mentioned a relay race, sack races, and a water balloon toss. I have a feeling it's going to be pretty hilarious.<p class="message sent">Haha, I can't wait to see Mr. Liu doing a sack race. It's going to be a riot.<p class=message>Yeah, and I heard he's bringing his dog too. Let's hope he doesn't eat all the hot dogs.<p class="message sent">Oh man, this is going to be great. Is it too early to start planning our team's outfits?<p class=message>Ha! Definitely not. I was thinking matching t-shirts with our team name on them. How about "The Office Athletes"?<p class="message sent">Love it! This is going to be the best work event ever. Thanks for telling me about it, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Anything to make our days a little more fun.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8beb8246-bdff-4060-9db6-66c1b088a06b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
