It's amazing!<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! And I wouldn't have thought a hotel buffet would have such great sushi.<p class=message>Right? And don't even get me started on the desserts. I think I gained five pounds just by looking at them.<p class="message sent">Haha, I know what you mean. But we're on vacation, so calories don't count, right?<p class=message>Absolutely! Speaking of vacation, have you visited any interesting places around here?<p class="message sent">Yes, I went to the museum yesterday. It was really interesting. They had a lot of artifacts from ancient civilizations.<p class=message>That sounds great. I went to the beach but it was too crowded for my liking.<p class="message sent">Yeah, the downside of being in a touristy area. But at least the weather's been great.<p class=message>You're right about that. I'm just happy to get away from the cold back home.<p class="message sent">Where are you from?<p class=message>I'm from Germany. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm from Australia.<p class=message>Nice! I've always wanted to visit Australia.<p class="message sent">You should definitely go. But be prepared for the crazy wildlife.<p class=message>Haha, I'll keep that in mind. So, what are you planning to do for the rest of the trip?<p class="message sent">I think I'm going to visit a few more museums and maybe try some local cuisine. How about you?<p class=message>I'm planning on taking a hike and visiting a nearby temple. And of course, indulging in more hotel buffets.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great plan. Enjoy the rest of your trip!<p class=message>Thanks, you too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=552f1a8b-f565-4f0c-be01-0233ee7b88df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
