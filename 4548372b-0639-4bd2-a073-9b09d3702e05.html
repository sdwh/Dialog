The seafood here is absolutely fantastic. What kind of dish were you hoping to make?<p class=message>I'm actually not sure, I was hoping to just see what was fresh and let it inspire me.<p class="message sent">That's a great plan. Let's take a look around.<p class=message>Wow, those giant crabs look amazing. Have you ever cooked with them before?<p class="message sent">Yes, they're a local favorite. One popular dish is steamed crab with sake and soy sauce.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. I think I'll grab a few of these.<p class="message sent">Good idea! And what about these squids over here? They're another Nagasaki specialty.<p class=message>Hmm, I've never cooked squid before. Do you have any tips?<p class="message sent">Sure, you'll want to clean them thoroughly and score the flesh before cooking. Grilling or stir-frying are both great options.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. I'll give it a try.<p class="message sent">Of course! And over here we have some fresh seaweed. It's often used in soup or salads.<p class=message>I love seaweed! Do you know any good recipes for it?<p class="message sent">You could make a simple seaweed salad with sesame oil and rice vinegar. Or try adding it to miso soup.<p class=message>Yum, those both sound delicious. I'll pick up a few pieces of seaweed as well.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Now that we've got our ingredients, let's head back to my home kitchen and get cooking!<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I can't wait to see what we can make with all of this fresh seafood.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=45479dbf-989e-4817-8cf1-49252772af7c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
