How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, thanks. Just trying to fix this darned machine.<p class=message>Yeah, I saw you were having some trouble. Can I give you a hand?<p class="message sent">That would be great, actually. I'm having trouble getting this part off.<p class=message>Let me take a look. Oh, I see what you mean. Here, try using this wrench instead.<p class="message sent">That's much better, thanks. You really know your stuff.<p class=message>Well, I've had my fair share of machine repairs. So, what do you think is causing the issue?<p class="message sent">It seems like the gears are jammed up. I'm going to have to take them out and clean them.<p class=message>Got it. I can help you with that too. We'll have this machine up and running in no time.<p class="message sent">Awesome, thanks so much. Hey, have you heard any good jokes lately?<p class=message>Hmm, let me think. Oh, I've got one. Why did the tomato turn red?<p class="message sent">I don't know, why?<p class=message>Because it saw the salad dressing!<p class="message sent">Hahaha, that's a good one. Here's one for you. What did the janitor say when he jumped out of the closet?<p class=message>I don't know, what?<p class="message sent">"Supplies!"<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious! Thanks for the laugh, B. Alright, let's get back to work. These gears aren't going to clean themselves.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7c8f800b-a958-4a5d-a118-42b2f57128db.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
