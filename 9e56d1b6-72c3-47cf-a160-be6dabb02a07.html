Are you ready to order?<p class="message sent">Hi, yes please. Can you recommend something that's not too heavy, but still really tasty?<p class=message>Definitely, our seafood salad is pretty popular. It's light, refreshing and packed with flavour. Does that sound good to you?<p class="message sent">Sounds great, I'll take that please.<p class=message>Excellent choice. Would you like anything to drink with that?<p class="message sent">Just water, please.<p class=message>No problem at all. And would you like to add any sides or toppings to your salad?<p class="message sent">Hmm, what do you recommend?<p class=message>The crab meat topping pairs really nicely with the salad, and we've got a garlic bread side that's really mmmm...<p class="message sent">Alright, sold. I'll add those as well.<p class=message>Wonderful. So, how has your day been so far?<p class="message sent">It's been pretty good, thanks for asking. Just doing some sightseeing around the city.<p class=message>Oh, any particular spots you'd recommend?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I visited the museum earlier and that was really interesting. And I'm planning on checking out the botanical gardens tomorrow.<p class=message>Ah, the museum is definitely worth seeing. And I hope the gardens don't disappoint. Do you have any other plans while you're here?<p class="message sent">Just trying to take it easy, really. Maybe catch a show or two, and definitely eat some good food while I'm at it.<p class=message>Well, you've definitely come to the right place for that. Our restaurant is known for its delicious meals.<p class="message sent">That's what I heard, and so far I'm definitely not disappointed.<p class=message>So glad to hear it! Your seafood salad will be out shortly. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e532543-d606-4fea-aa9f-ff141faa6564.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
