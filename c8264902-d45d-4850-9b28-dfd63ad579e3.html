Mind if I ask what you're planning to do with it?<p class="message sent">Hey! Yeah, these are some top-quality oysters. I'm planning to sell them at the market for a good price.<p class=message>Really? I'm just a farmer, I wouldn't know much about seafood prices. How much are they going for?<p class="message sent">It depends on the size and quality, but around 20-30 yuan each.<p class=message>Wow, that's pretty expensive. But I suppose it's worth it for some high-quality seafood.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Fresh seafood like this is perfect for special occasions or just a nice dinner at home.<p class=message>Do you have any tips on how to prepare oysters?<p class="message sent">Of course! My personal favorite is to just grill them with some garlic butter for a few minutes until they're cooked through.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! I'll have to try that sometime.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And if you need any more seafood advice, feel free to ask.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. I'm always looking for new and tasty ways to cook up my harvest from the farm.<p class="message sent">I bet! I love cooking with fresh ingredients, there's really nothing like it.<p class=message>That's true. And it's great to support local businesses like yours too. Thanks for the chat and advice!<p class="message sent">My pleasure.
