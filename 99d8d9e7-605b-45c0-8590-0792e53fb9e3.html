Where are you headed today?<p class=message>I'm headed to Kaohsiung for a weekend getaway. Do you have any recommendations for things to do there?<p class="message sent">Well, you can check out the Love River, the Pier-2 Art Center, and the Liuhe Night Market. They're all really popular tourist spots.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. Have you been to any of those places yourself?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've been to all of them. The Love River is especially beautiful at night when all the lights come on.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm really looking forward to seeing it all. Do you have any favorite local foods I should try?<p class="message sent">Definitely try the steamed fish at the night market. It's a specialty of the area and it's delicious.<p class=message>I'll make sure to remember that. So, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for over ten years now. It's a good job for me because I enjoy meeting new people every day.<p class=message>That's really interesting. Do you have any crazy stories or interesting encounters from driving all these years?<p class="message sent">Oh, I've definitely had my fair share of interesting passengers. Once, I even drove a famous politician from the airport to his hotel.<p class=message>Wow, that must have been exciting. Do you have any tips for someone who's new to taking taxis?<p class="message sent">Always make sure to negotiate the fare before getting in. And if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask your driver.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely keep it in mind. We're almost at the train station now. Thanks for the great conversation!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, have a great trip in Kaohsiung!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99ccb5af-7e24-4870-8037-63f58d2f37a2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
