How are they planning on doing that?<p class=message>Well, they’ve hired a team of inspectors whose sole job is to go through every product to make sure it meets all the standards.<p class="message sent">Wow, that’s a lot of work. But I guess it’s worth it if the quality of our products goes up.<p class=message>Exactly! Plus, it’ll cut down on the number of returns and complaints we get from customers.<p class="message sent">That’s true. So, are we going to be part of the quality controls team too?<p class=message>No, apparently it’s going to be a separate department. But we will have to attend training sessions to learn more about the standards and expectations.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Do you know when these sessions will be held?<p class=message>I think the first one is next week. They’ve invited all employees to attend.<p class="message sent">Great, I’ll make sure to mark my calendar. So, what happens if a product doesn’t meet the standards?<p class=message>It’ll be sent back for rework. The inspectors will have the authority to reject any product that doesn’t meet the criteria.<p class="message sent">I see. I hope they’re not too strict though. We don’t want to reject too many products and cause delays.<p class=message>Yeah, that’s true. But I think they’ve done their research and have set realistic standards.<p class="message sent">Ok, that’s good to know. I’m actually excited to see how this new system will work out.<p class=message>Me too. It’s always good to have a focus on quality control, and I think this new initiative will really make a difference.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let’s hope it’s smooth sailing from here on out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ca6b7ca1-0e5d-44de-8ed4-0a049694da95.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
