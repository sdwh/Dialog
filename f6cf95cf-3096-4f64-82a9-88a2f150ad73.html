We're brewing a South African style beer, right?<p class=message>That's right. I think we should use some rooibos tea in this batch to give it a unique flavor.<p class="message sent">Good idea. How about we also add some honeybush to make it extra sweet?<p class=message>Perfect, that should complement the tea nicely. Have you tried any South African beers before?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I'm eager to taste our creation. Have you?<p class=message>Yes, I actually studied abroad in South Africa and tried a lot of different beers. They have some amazing craft breweries there.<p class="message sent">Really? I never would have guessed that. What's your favorite South African beer?<p class=message>There's a brewery in Cape Town called Devil's Peak Brewery that makes a great IPA. It's called King's Blockhouse.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. Maybe we can try making our own IPA in the future.<p class=message>Definitely. But for now, let's focus on getting this batch just right. Have you prepped all the ingredients we need?<p class="message sent">Yes, everything is ready to go. We can start brewing as soon as you're ready.<p class=message>Let's do it! I can't wait to taste our South African inspired beer.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f6c8e5e3-6389-495a-909e-c8fef4236183.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
