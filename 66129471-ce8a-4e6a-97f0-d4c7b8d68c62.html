How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain, just trying to keep up with all the new projects that keep coming in.<p class="message sent">Speaking of projects, do you have any updates on our current business strategy?<p class=message>Yes, actually I was just going to bring that up. I think we should focus more on social media marketing.<p class="message sent">Interesting, can you elaborate on why you think that's the way to go?<p class=message>Well, studies have shown that social media platforms are becoming the primary way people consume content, so it would make sense to take advantage of that.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. What kind of content do you think we should be producing for social media?<p class=message>I think we should stick to our strengths and showcase the quality of our products in a visually appealing way.<p class="message sent">Good idea. Do you have any specific platforms in mind?<p class=message>At the moment, I think we should focus on Instagram and LinkedIn. We can build a great brand presence there.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a solid plan. Do you need any help executing it?<p class=message>Actually, I was hoping you would take the lead on this project. You have a great eye for design and would be perfect to create content for our social media.<p class="message sent">Wow, I appreciate the trust you have in me. You can count on me to make it happen.<p class=message>Awesome, let's touch base next week to check in on progress.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Thanks for the opportunity, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. I'm always happy to see my team develop and grow.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=66115ae4-0dfd-4078-b30c-ed2b56357e46.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
