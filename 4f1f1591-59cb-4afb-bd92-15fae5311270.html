My name is Chef A. I'm excited to learn about making wagashi, traditional Japanese sweets. What's your name?<p class="message sent">Hi, Chef A. I'm B, a photographer. Nice to meet you, and welcome to Kyoto!<p class=message>Thank you! I've heard so much about wagashi and I can't wait to learn more.<p class="message sent">Well, you're in the right place. Kyoto has a long history of making wagashi, so we'll definitely get some good tips here.<p class=message>Do you have any favorite wagashi?<p class="message sent">I really like daifuku, which is a soft mochi with sweet filling inside.<p class=message>Ah, I've tried that before. It was delicious. I'm excited to learn how to make it.<p class="message sent">Yeah, daifuku is pretty popular. But there are also many other types of wagashi that are worth trying.<p class=message>That's true. What equipment do we need to make wagashi?<p class="message sent">We'll need a few basic tools like a mortar and pestle, a strainer, and some molds.<p class=message>I see. I hope I can make wagashi that look pretty as well as taste good.<p class="message sent">I'm sure you'll be able to. I can help you take some great photos of your creations too.<p class=message>That would be awesome! Do you have any tips for taking food photos?<p class="message sent">Sure. Lighting is important, so we should try to find some natural light. And always consider the composition of the photo.<p class=message>Good to know. I'm excited to learn more and take some great photos of our wagashi.<p class="message sent">Me too, Chef A.
