Welcome to our farm. Are you excited about picking some fruits?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I've never done it before. Which fruits are we picking today?<p class=message>We have plenty of peaches, apples, and pears ripe for the picking. You can start with whichever fruit you like.<p class="message sent">Great! Do I need any special equipment for this?<p class=message>We'll provide you with a basket and some gloves. Just gather the fruit in the basket without damaging it.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll be careful. Do you have any tips for picking the best fruits?<p class=message>Look for fruits that are firm and have a nice color. Also, make sure they are not bruised or have insect holes. The ones with a good smell are often the sweetest.<p class="message sent">Thank you for the tips! Do you grow any exotic fruits here?<p class=message>Not really. Our farm is mainly for peaches, apples, and pears. But we do have some seasonal fruits like cherries and apricots.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! I can't wait to try them. By the way, how long have you been running this farm?<p class=message>My family has been farming here for generations. We take pride in producing high-quality fruits for our customers.<p class="message sent">That's amazing! I admire your dedication to farming. It's hard work but rewarding, right?<p class=message>Yes, it is. But seeing customers enjoy the fruits of our labor makes it all worth it. Plus, it's a wonderful way of life.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's a great way to connect with nature and appreciate where our food comes from. Thank you for this experience.<p class=message>You're welcome. It was great having you here. Don't forget to take some fruits home with you, too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=25dc3c0c-64d4-4c2a-885b-29da4c1e86ec.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
