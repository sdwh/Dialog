It's nice to see you again. How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hello, Lawyer A. I'm a bit stressed about the case we've been working on. Do you have any updates for me?<p class=message>Yes, actually. I managed to gather more evidence to support our defense. It's looking good for us.<p class="message sent">That's great news! Maybe I should treat you to lunch to celebrate our upcoming victory.<p class=message>Ha! I'll hold you to that, B. But let's not count our chickens before they hatch. We still have a way to go.<p class="message sent">You're right. I'm sorry, I'm just relieved that our chances are looking up.<p class=message>No worries, B. That's why I'm here to help alleviate some of that stress. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have a question. Have you ever watched "Suits"?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's a great show, but not completely accurate when it comes to the legal processes.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Well, I just find it interesting how they make it all dramatic and intense.<p class=message>That's Hollywood for you. But trust me, the real-life legal world is just as intense and dramatic without the theatrics.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I can imagine. Thank you for always being there for me, Lawyer A. I feel much better after talking to you.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Let's get this case sorted out together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=606babc8-5e63-4ec8-90a6-6eeaa81b1017.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
