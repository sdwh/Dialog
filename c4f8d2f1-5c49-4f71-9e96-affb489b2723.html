How have you been since we last saw you?<p class="message sent">I've been doing well, Officer A. I hope everything has been going well for you too.<p class=message>Actually, we have some questions for you regarding the recent bank robbery. Do you know anything about it?<p class="message sent">I'm sorry, Officer A. I have no idea what you're talking about. I've been out of town for the past week.<p class=message>That's interesting. According to our records, you were actually in town during the time of the robbery.<p class="message sent">Well, I must have been mistaken then. Is there anything else you'd like to know?<p class=message>Yes, actually. We found some fingerprints at the crime scene that match yours. Can you explain that?<p class="message sent">Oh...um...I must have accidentally touched something in the bank earlier that day.<p class=message>I see. And what about the surveillance footage that clearly shows you entering and leaving the bank at the time of the robbery?<p class="message sent">Well, Officer, I guess I can't really explain that one.<p class=message>It seems like you might have been involved in the robbery after all. Do you have anything to say for yourself?<p class="message sent">I'm really sorry, Officer. I was going through some tough times and I made a mistake. I'll do whatever it takes to make things right.<p class=message>Alright, Mr. B. We appreciate your honesty. We'll work with you to ensure that justice is served.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Officer. I really appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem. That's what we're here for.<p class="message sent">And Officer, can I just say that your uniform looks really sharp today?<p class=message>(chuckles) Thank you, Mr. B. It's always nice to receive a compliment, even in a situation like this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c4f810ca-2c13-4381-aead-3054a8274a8f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
