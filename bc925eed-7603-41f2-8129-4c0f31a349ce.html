What else can we do to improve our security?<p class="message sent">Well, first, we need to make sure that everyone in the company is aware of cybersecurity threats and the importance of following security protocols. Education is key.<p class=message>That's a good point. But what about using encryption and firewalls?<p class="message sent">Yes, encryption and firewalls are important tools to protect our networks, but we also need to ensure that all software and applications are up to date with security patches.<p class=message>I see. Also, what about password management?<p class="message sent">Good password management is critical. We need to encourage employees to use strong passwords that are changed regularly and to not share them with anyone.<p class=message>Right, I remember reading that some hackers use social engineering to get people to give them their login information.<p class="message sent">Exactly. Hackers often use phishing scams or social engineering attacks to trick employees into giving away sensitive information.<p class=message>I think we are on the same page here. It's important to stay vigilant, update security measures and educate everyone in the company. Thank you for the insightful discussion.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. It's always good to have these discussions and ensure we are doing everything we can to prevent cyber attacks.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bc91500c-7cdd-4895-b08c-fe5d6e7b32fd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
