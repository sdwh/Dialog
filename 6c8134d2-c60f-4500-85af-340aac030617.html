I'm really excited to learn how to make some traditional Spanish desserts.<p class="message sent">Great to hear that! Welcome to this lovely pastry shop in Barcelona. My name is Carlos and I'll be your guide for today.<p class=message>Nice to meet you, Carlos. Can you tell me what we'll be making?<p class="message sent">Yes, of course. We'll be making some classic churros con chocolate and also some crema catalana.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds amazing! Which one should we start with?<p class="message sent">Let's start with the churros first. We'll need to mix flour, water, and salt together to create the dough.<p class=message>That sounds simple enough. Do we need any special equipment?<p class="message sent">Yes, we'll need a pastry bag with a star-shaped nozzle to get the perfect shape. And don't forget to heat up the oil for frying!<p class=message>Got it. What's next?<p class="message sent">Once the churros are cooked, we'll serve them with a warm chocolate sauce for dipping. It's the perfect combination!<p class=message>Wow, I can't wait to try them! And what's the other dessert we'll be making?<p class="message sent">We'll also be making crema catalana, which is a creamy custard with a caramelized sugar crust on top.<p class=message>That sounds delicious too. What are the ingredients we need for this?<p class="message sent">We'll need milk, sugar, egg yolks, cornstarch, and a cinnamon stick to give it a hint of flavor.<p class=message>This is so exciting! Can we start baking already?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's get our hands dirty and start mixing the ingredients. I'm sure you'll be a great baker in no time!<p class=message>(laughs) I hope so. This is such a fun experience, thank you for showing me around, Carlos.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A! Baking and cooking are such great ways to immerse yourself in the culture of a new place. I'm glad we could share this experience together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6c7471e4-845f-40b8-b8d5-eb65a9abe103.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
