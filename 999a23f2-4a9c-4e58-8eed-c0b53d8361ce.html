Thanks for picking me up. Are you from around here?<p class="message sent">No, I'm actually from Osaka. But I've been driving in Tokyo for a few years now.<p class=message>Oh, I see. That sounds interesting. Do you enjoy it?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I really enjoy it. It's always exciting to drive around Tokyo and see everything it has to offer.<p class=message>That's for sure. What's your favorite spot in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">I love going to the Tsukiji Fish Market. It's always bustling with people and there's so much to see and try.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds amazing. I've never been there before. Do you have any recommendations for what to try?<p class="message sent">You've got to try the sushi! It's the freshest you'll ever taste. And if you're feeling adventurous, try the sea urchin.<p class=message>Hmm, I'm not sure about that one! But I'll definitely give the sushi a try.<p class="message sent">Trust me, you won't regret it. So what brings you to Tokyo?<p class=message>I'm here on vacation. I've always wanted to see the cherry blossoms in full bloom, so I thought now would be the perfect time to come.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Cherry blossom season is always a sight to see. Do you have any other plans while you're here?<p class=message>Yes, I'm planning on visiting some temples and shrines, and maybe even taking a day trip to Kyoto. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out Sensoji Temple in Asakusa. It's one of the oldest temples in Tokyo and it's very beautiful. And if you make it out to Kyoto, make sure to check out Fushimi Inari Shrine. It's definitely worth the trip.<p class=message>Great, thanks for the tip! We're getting close to my destination now.<p class="message sent">No problem, I hope you enjoy your time in Tokyo. Don't forget to try some ramen while you're here!<p class=message>I won't! Thanks again for the ride.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=999553a9-f3b4-48c9-b8d6-a9a8bae0c3e1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
