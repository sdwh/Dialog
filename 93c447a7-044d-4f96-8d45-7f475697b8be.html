It's great to see you here in our little school in the countryside.<p class="message sent">Hi, A! Yes, it's always wonderful to visit schools like this. What have you been up to?<p class=message>Well, we've been discussing ways to improve our students' self-esteem and emotional connections. What do you think would be some good ideas?<p class="message sent">Hmm, well we could try promoting collaboration and teamwork among the students. It's always good for their confidence when they work together.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We could also encourage them to express themselves through art and music. It helps build their creativity and self-expression.<p class="message sent">Yes, absolutely! And we could also bring in guest speakers to talk to them about their experiences and provide positive role models for them.<p class=message>Oh, that's a brilliant idea! Do you know anyone who would be interested in speaking to our students?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually I do! I have a friend who overcame some big challenges in life and has a really inspiring story to share.<p class=message>That sounds perfect! When can we set up the talk?<p class="message sent">I'll check with my friend and get back to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, let's keep brainstorming some more ideas.<p class=message>Yes, let's! I also think having more outdoor activities and field trips could also help build their confidence and sense of discovery.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We could organize a camping trip or nature hike for them. It'll be a fun and educational experience for them!<p class=message>Great idea! Thanks for all these wonderful suggestions, B. I feel much more confident in our ability to help build our students' self-esteem and emotional connections.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. I'm so happy to be able to work together with you to improve the lives of these children.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=93c2efd8-ca1c-4149-820f-e287a534e40e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
