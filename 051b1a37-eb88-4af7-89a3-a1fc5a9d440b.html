I've been trying to improve my rhythm.<p class="message received message-content">Okay, let's start with some basic beats. Do you have any specific style you want to play?<p class="message sent message-content">Not really, but can we start with something simple like a rock beat?<p class="message received message-content">Sure thing! I'll set up the drum kit and you can take the first go.<p class="message sent message-content">Woah, it's so much louder than I expected!<p class="message received message-content">That's the fun of it. Just let loose and feel the beat.<p class="message sent message-content">Okay, now I understand the expression "let it all out", hahaha!<p class="message received message-content">That's the spirit! Just keep practicing and you'll improve in no time.<p class="message sent message-content">Hey Dad, do you think we'll be good enough to play at a concert someday?<p class="message received message-content">Who knows, maybe we can start a family band. I'll take the guitar, you on drums, and your sister on vocals.<p class="message sent message-content">Haha, that sounds awesome! Maybe we could even play at your work's annual party.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds like a plan. But first, let's get some more practice in before we book any gigs.<p class="message sent message-content">Agreed, let's keep practicing together and improve our skills.<p class="message received message-content">Great mindset, son! Keep at it and the sky's the limit.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=051946cf-538e-4b14-afa7-6c7821528097.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
