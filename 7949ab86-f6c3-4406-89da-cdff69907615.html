Thanks for meeting with me today. Would you like to order anything to drink?<p class="message sent">Hi! Sure, I'll have a cappuccino, please.<p class=message>Sounds good. So, let's jump right into the interview. How did you get into your line of work?<p class="message sent">It actually all started when I was a kid. I was always interested in tinkering with things and figuring out how they worked.<p class=message>That's really cool. And now you're one of the leading experts in your field. What's been a highlight of your career so far?<p class="message sent">Definitely when I got to work on a project for NASA. Being part of something like that was a dream come true.<p class=message>Wow, that's incredible. Speaking of dreams, what's something you've always wanted to try but haven't had the chance to yet?<p class="message sent">I've always wanted to go skydiving, but I haven't worked up the courage yet.<p class=message>I can definitely understand that. So, what do you do to unwind after a stressful day at work?<p class="message sent">Usually, I'll go for a long run or play some basketball. Exercise always helps me clear my head.<p class=message>I'm the same way. Do you have any favorite hobbies or pastimes outside of work?<p class="message sent">I love reading and listening to music. And I also enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes.<p class=message>Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies too. What's your favorite dish to make?<p class="message sent">I make a mean lasagna. It's been passed down in my family for generations.<p class=message>I might have to come over for dinner sometime and try it. Alright, well that's all the questions I have for today. Thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me.<p class="message sent">Of course, it was great to meet you. Thanks for having me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7933599e-54c7-4132-865d-3f15755e6b58.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
