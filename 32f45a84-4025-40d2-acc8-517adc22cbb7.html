Are you ready for a busy day serving up some delicious BBQ?<p class="message sent">You bet, A! I've got my apron on and my notepad at the ready.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, what's on the menu for today?<p class="message sent">Well, we've got our famous brisket, pulled pork, and smoked sausage.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. I think I'll have to sneak a taste of everything before we open.<p class="message sent">Ha! You and me both. So, did you catch the game last night?<p class=message>I did. What a nail-biter that was. But at least our team came out on top.<p class="message sent">Right? I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Speaking of which, did you see that new BBQ sauce we got in?<p class=message>No, I haven't yet. What flavor is it?<p class="message sent">It's a spicy maple bourbon. I tried it yesterday, and it's amazing on the brisket.<p class=message>I'll have to give it a try. Hey, did you hear that we've been featured in the local magazine?<p class="message sent">What? Really? That's incredible!<p class=message>Yep, they even praised your excellent service skills.<p class="message sent">Well, I do try my best. I'm just glad we're getting some recognition for all our hard work.<p class=message>Agreed. And since we're talking about recognition, did you see that customer's reaction when they took their first bite of our BBQ last night?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, they were practically dancing in their seat. There's no greater satisfaction than seeing someone love what we do here.<p class=message>Absolutely. Hey, speaking of satisfaction, I think our ribs are just about ready to come out of the smoker.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's get them sliced up and ready to serve. With food like this, we're going to be busy all day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=32f38ef1-850b-4b41-ae0a-745f383ff812.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
