It sets the standard for information security management."<p class="message sent">"Oh, I didn't know that. But it still sounds boring."<p class=message>"Not at all! It's like a ninja warrior obstacle course for your business data."<p class="message sent">"You've piqued my interest. What kind of obstacles are we talking about?"<p class=message>"Well, there's physical security like access control, fire prevention, and even earthquake-proofing!"<p class="message sent">"Wow, I never thought of that as part of security. What else?"<p class=message>"Then there's network security, like encryption, anti-virus, and firewalls. It's like building a digital moat around your business."<p class="message sent">"I like that. A digital moat. But do I need a wizard to set it up?"<p class=message>"No wizard necessary! There are plenty of experts who can help you get started, and the benefits make it worth it. You'll be protecting your sensitive data from hackers, competitors, and even careless employees."<p class="message sent">"Alright, you've convinced me. I'll look into ISO 27001 Security Control. Thanks for the ninja warrior metaphor!"<p class=message>"No problem, any time. And remember, safety first... and second, and third, and fourth..."<p class="message sent">"Haha, got it. It's like wearing a seatbelt, always better to be safe than sorry."<p class=message>"Exactly! You're catching on quickly, my friend."<p class="message sent">"Thanks, I try my best to keep up."<p class=message>"Well, you're doing a great job. Keep those ninja warrior moves sharp!"<p class="message sent">"I'll do my best. Thanks, you're a helpful assistant."<p class=message>"Always happy to help!"</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=153817e2-b198-4ceb-9b3e-58a5f84598b9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
