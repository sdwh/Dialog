It's a dish that I can never get enough of. How about you?<p class=message>No, I haven't, but I'm really curious about it. What's your favorite type?<p class="message sent">My favorite has got to be the classic Peruvian Ceviche. The acidity and the spiciness of the dish are just perfect!<p class=message>That sounds interesting. Is it difficult to make?<p class="message sent">Not at all! You just need to get fresh fish, some lime juice, onions, chili peppers, cilantro, and some salt. Mix them all together and let them sit for a while, and voila! You have your own homemade Ceviche.<p class=message>Wow, that seems easy enough! Is it usually served as an appetizer or a main course?<p class="message sent">It can be either, but I prefer it as a main course since it's quite filling. Plus, I can never resist having more than one serving.<p class=message>Haha, glad to hear you're a big fan of Ceviche. Maybe I'll give it a try sometime soon.<p class="message sent">You definitely should! And if you need any tips or a taste tester, don't hesitate to let me know.<p class=message>Thanks, that's very kind of you. Maybe one day we can have a Ceviche party and invite some friends over!<p class="message sent">Now, that's a great idea! We can even have some Pisco Sours to go with it.<p class=message>I'm sold! Let's start planning it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ced5d62c-39e7-4682-91ab-6d40b073cef3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
