Exciting stuff we’re working on today huh? How do you keep up with all the demand?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A! It's like a never-ending game of scalability. You can never have enough power! I think I'm going to recommend we go for a Kubernetes deployment.<p class=message>Kubernetes huh? That sounds interesting. Can you explain a little more about how it works and how it’ll help us?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. It'll make managing our infrastructure a lot easier and save us loads of time.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like just what we need. How about the actual servers themselves? What do you think will be the best type of server to use?<p class="message sent">I was thinking about putting together a cluster of AWS EC2 instances to create a high availability setup. This would give us the capacity handling we need, while also providing an easily scalable infrastructure.<p class=message>That sounds perfect, B! It seems like you know your way around server management. I'm glad we’re in good hands.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I try my best to stay up to date with the latest tech trends.<p class=message>Speaking of trends...have you been playing any new video games lately? I've been pretty into "Among Us" lately.<p class="message sent">Yes! I've actually been playing a lot of "Fall Guys" in my spare time, it's quite addictive.<p class=message>Haha, I hear ya. If only we could put as much time and energy into our work as we do into our games!<p class="message sent">Ain't that the truth! Maybe one day we'll get paid to play games full time. It's not like we couldn't handle it, right?<p class=message>Hah, exactly! Well, I'm excited to see what our new architecture will do for our traffic, so let's get working!<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's get to it and make some awesome stuff happen.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ec2b2e90-a1f4-43a1-9f53-571fe48ff653.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
