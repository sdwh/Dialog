It's been a good source of income for me.<p class=message>That's great. Do you enjoy driving around the city?<p class="message sent">Actually, it's quite interesting. You get to see all sorts of people and places. It never gets boring.<p class=message>I can imagine. Do you have any funny or interesting stories from your time as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh, I have plenty. One time, a customer left a parrot in the backseat and it wouldn't stop talking.<p class=message>That's hilarious! What did you do?<p class="message sent">I had to pull over and call the customer to come back for her talkative bird. It was quite a memorable ride.<p class=message>(laughs) I bet it was. So, what do you do during your free time?<p class="message sent">Well, I love playing cricket. It's a great way to stay active and socialize with friends.<p class=message>That's awesome. I'm more of a soccer fan myself. Do you follow any sports teams?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm a big fan of the Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League.<p class=message>Nice choice! I'm a Manchester United supporter. We may have to agree to disagree on that one.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Fair enough. So, where are you headed today?<p class=message>I need to go to the airport. I'm flying back to the States.<p class="message sent">Oh, I hope you had a good visit in Delhi.<p class=message>I did, thanks. The food was amazing and the people were so friendly.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. Delhi has a lot of beautiful sights to see as well.<p class=message>Yes, I visited the Taj Mahal too. It was absolutely breathtaking.<p class="message sent">(nodding) It certainly is. I've driven many customers to Agra to see it.<p class=message>You must know the route like the back of your hand then.<p class="message sent">(laughing) You could say that. Well, we're almost at the airport now. Have a safe trip back home.<p class=message>Thank you so much. It was great chatting with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d3bb2d32-de82-4bbb-8449-543803224c18.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
