It's about the standard for information security management.<p class=message>Exactly! So, what do you think about it?<p class="message sent">I think it's pretty important these days, especially with all the data breaches happening.<p class=message>Agreed! Have you had any experience with data breaches?<p class="message sent">Not personally, but I know someone who has. It was a nightmare!<p class=message>Oh wow, that's scary. What can we do to prevent it?<p class="message sent">Well, I think implementing ISO 27001 can definitely minimize the risks.<p class=message>That's a good point. But isn't it expensive to implement?<p class="message sent">It can be, but think about the potential cost of a data breach. It's worth the investment.<p class=message>True. Do you think companies are doing enough to protect their customer's data?<p class="message sent">Some are, but definitely not all. It's still a big problem.<p class=message>It's good to know that there are standards like ISO 27001 in place to help with this issue.<p class="message sent">Yes, it definitely provides some peace of mind. But we still need to be vigilant.<p class=message>Absolutely. Are there any other standards like this for other types of security?<p class="message sent">Yes, there's ISO 22301 for business continuity and ISO 31000 for risk management.<p class=message>Wow, I had no idea. You really know your stuff!<p class="message sent">Well, I try to stay informed. It's important in this field.<p class=message>Definitely. Thanks for sharing your knowledge with me!<p class="message sent">No problem. It's always great to have these discussions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fa4b6eb5-bd7e-417a-b59a-531d30668c45.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
