How are you handling the dinner rush tonight?<p class="message sent">Hey, A. It's been quite overwhelming, but we're managing to keep up. Thanks for offering to help out in the kitchen.<p class=message>No problem, buddy. I'm happy to lend a hand. What's on the menu tonight?<p class="message sent">Our special tonight is grilled ribeye steak with garlic mashed potatoes and saut√©ed asparagus. We're also serving our popular chicken Alfredo and an assorted seafood platter.<p class=message>Yum! That all sounds delicious. I'll start prepping the asparagus while you get started on the ribeye.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Hey A, do you know what's the difference between a chef and a cook?<p class=message>Hmm, I'm not sure. What is it?<p class="message sent">A chef takes ownership of his or her creations, while a cook just follows a recipe.<p class=message>Interesting, I didn't know that. Well, I guess that makes me a cook then.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Don't be too hard on yourself. I've seen you in action, and you definitely have some chef skills.<p class=message>(smiling) Thanks, B. That means a lot coming from you.<p class="message sent">By the way, did you hear about the restaurant that hired a bunch of math majors to be servers?<p class=message>No, what happened?<p class="message sent">They figured they'd give them a chance to use their STEM degrees, but they all ended up getting fired for constantly asking "Does everything add up?"<p class=message>(laughs) That's terrible, but also kind of funny.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Yeah, it's good to have a sense of humor in this industry. It helps keep the stress levels down.<p class=message>Speaking of stress, are we almost done with these dishes?<p class="message sent">Just a few more plates to go, then we can take a breather.<p class=message>(wiping sweat off his forehead) Phew, I can't wait. I think I need a drink after all this hard work.<p class="message sent">(nodding) I hear you. Let's grab a cold one and toast to a successful night.<p class=message>(smiling) Sounds like the perfect way to end this shift.
