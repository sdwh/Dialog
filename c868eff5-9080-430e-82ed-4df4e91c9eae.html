I'm a baker and I'm excited to learn how to make some Spanish sweets today.<p class="message sent">Welcome to this sweet little shop in Barcelona! I'm happy to take you on a sugar-filled journey.<p class=message>So what's on the menu?<p class="message sent">We are going to make churros and chocolate first. Have you ever made these before?<p class=message>I've made churros a few times, but I'm not confident in my recipe.<p class="message sent">No worries, I'm here to help. First, we need to mix flour, water, and salt, and pipe it through a star-shaped tip.<p class=message>That sounds easy enough. What's next?<p class="message sent">Then, we fry them until they are golden and crispy. And voila, churros are ready!<p class=message>Wow, that was simpler than I expected. Now, what about the chocolate?<p class="message sent">It's even easier! We just need to melt high-quality chocolate and add some milk or cream to make it smoother.<p class=message>This experience has been amazing! What's up next?<p class="message sent">We'll make some ensaimadas, a sweet pastry typical of Mallorca. But first, let's enjoy these delicious churros and chocolate.<p class=message>Definitely, I could eat this all day. What do Spaniards typically eat for dessert?<p class="message sent">Many people eat flan, a traditional custard dessert, or leche frita, which is fried custard.<p class=message>I'll have to try those too. This has been an amazing experience, thank you so much for teaching me how to make these Spanish sweets.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, it always makes me happy to share the sweetness of our culture.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c866546c-1608-4cac-952a-1aa127eb7a41.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
