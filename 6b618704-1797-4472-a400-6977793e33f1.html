How was your day today?<p class="message sent">Hi A! It was busy, but I can't complain. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. We had a lot of orders tonight, but it's always exciting to see our guests enjoying their meals.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Speaking of meals, have you tried the new dish we added to the menu?<p class=message>Which one is it?<p class="message sent">It's the sea bass with truffle and asparagus risotto.<p class=message>Ah yes, I had it yesterday during our staff meal. It's delicious! I think it's going to be a hit with our customers.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that. And for the wine pairing, I suggest the Chablis Grand Cru Les Blanchots. Its mineral and floral notes complement the dish perfectly.<p class=message>That sounds like a great pairing. Thanks for the suggestion, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. By the way, did you hear about the new cocktail bar that opened up down the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class="message sent">It's called Le Verre Vol√©. They have a great selection of rare spirits and their bartenders are really knowledgeable.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. Maybe we should check it out after work one of these days?<p class="message sent">Definitely! Let's plan on it. But for now, we have some tables to attend to. Time to get back to work!<p class=message>Agreed. Thanks for the chat, B. Let's make tonight a great one!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b5f6f31-1762-456e-ae3c-89923ab306cf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
