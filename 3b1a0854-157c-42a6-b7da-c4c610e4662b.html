How's your day been, driver B?<p class="message sent">Hi A! It's been pretty busy since morning, but I'm glad to have you on board with me now.<p class=message>I'm going to Hiroshima for my friend's wedding. Have you ever been there?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. It's a beautiful place with a lot of history. Make sure to try the Okonomiyaki there. It's a must-have dish!<p class=message>Oh, I've heard about that. I'll definitely give it a try. What else do you recommend?<p class="message sent">The Peace Memorial Park is a must-visit place for anyone going to Hiroshima. And if you want to learn more about the city's history, the Hiroshima Castle is a good place to go.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. I'm really excited to explore the city.<p class="message sent">I'm sure you'll have a great time. Is this your first visit to Japan?<p class=message>Yes, it is.<p class="message sent">Awesome! Japan has a lot to offer, and I'm sure you'll love it here.<p class=message>I have a question, B. What kind of music do you listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">Oh, I listen to all kinds of music, but I prefer old-school rock and roll. What about you?<p class=message>I'm a pop fan, but I also enjoy listening to jazz and blues.<p class="message sent">Nice! I'll have to give pop a listen sometime. It's always good to broaden my music tastes.<p class=message>Absolutely! Music is a universal language that brings people together.<p class="message sent">Totally agree! We're almost there, A. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the city?<p class=message>No, I think I'll wait to explore it myself. Thanks for the great conversation and the recommendations, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. I hope you have a wonderful time in Hiroshima. Take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3b17777d-1d87-4bbd-bc5e-bff136b9d3b1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
