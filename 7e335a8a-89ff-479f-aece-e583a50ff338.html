Could you take me to Boston, please?<p class="message sent">Of course! Is this your first time in Boston?<p class=message>No, I've been there a few times before. But I'm still excited to visit again.<p class="message sent">Boston is a beautiful city. Do you have any plans for your trip?<p class=message>Yes, I'm planning to visit the historic sites and explore the food scene. What about you? Do you have any favorite places in Boston?<p class="message sent">As a matter of fact, I do. The lobster rolls at Legal Sea Foods are a must-try. And you can't miss the Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox.<p class=message>I've heard great things about both. I'll definitely check them out. How long have you been driving a taxi in Boston?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for almost ten years now. It's a challenging job, but I love meeting new people and hearing their stories.<p class=message>That's awesome. Have you ever had any funny or interesting experiences with passengers?<p class="message sent">Oh, plenty. One time, I had a passenger who insisted on playing the bagpipes in my car. It was quite a ride!<p class=message>Haha, I can imagine. I hope I'm not a difficult passenger for you.<p class="message sent">Not at all! You seem very easy-going. We'll be in Boston in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7e32207f-90eb-43e3-a043-68d895dd4e35.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
