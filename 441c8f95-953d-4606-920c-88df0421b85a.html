I've been eyeing that dessert table since we walked in.<p class=message>Same here. I'm trying to pace myself, but it's hard not to indulge.<p class="message sent">I know what you mean. I already have my eye on that chocolate fountain.<p class=message>Oh wow, I didn't even see that. I have to go get some fruit to dip in it.<p class="message sent">Good idea. But have you tried the sushi? It's surprisingly good.<p class=message>No, I haven't. I've been too caught up in the salad bar.<p class="message sent">Well, you have to give it a try. And speaking of trying things, have you tried the local cuisine yet?<p class=message>Yes, I had some amazing street food yesterday. How about you?<p class="message sent">I tried a new seafood dish last night, and it was surprisingly delicious. I might even try it again tonight.<p class=message>That's great. Exploration is what traveling is all about.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Although, I think I might need to hit the gym after all of this eating.<p class=message>Yeah, same here. I don't think my jeans can take much more of this buffet.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well, at least we'll have some amazing memories and stories to tell when we get home.<p class=message>Absolutely. And the best part is, we'll always be able to come back to this hotel and enjoy this buffet again.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Now you're speaking my language.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=440cd337-4059-44a8-89ae-66bf4a1a1fe3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
