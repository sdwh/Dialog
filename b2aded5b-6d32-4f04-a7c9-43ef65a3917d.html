I can't wait to try it.<p class=message>Do you want to taste test it before we start serving customers?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And we should probably start making the pineapple cakes too.<p class=message>Good point. Those are a favorite in this area.<p class="message sent">Yeah, tourists always love our local snacks. Do you enjoy making them too?<p class=message>Of course, I'm passionate about all types of food. I like experimenting with new recipes too.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. We could look into adding some new dishes to the menu.<p class=message>Definitely. Maybe we could do a fusion of Taiwanese and Western cuisine.<p class="message sent">That could be a hit. We could even do a special theme night.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We could have a monthly special theme night to mix things up.<p class="message sent">And we could promote it on our social media channels. It would draw in even more customers.<p class=message>I like the way you think. Let's get started on these pineapple cakes so we can make that happen.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And don't forget to add that secret ingredient that makes our cakes stand out.<p class=message>Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. Just sit back and enjoy the aroma of these cakes baking.<p class="message sent">As long as I get to enjoy the taste too, I'm happy.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b2ad4ec0-4e1a-4550-84c2-bb8c8b6dd89a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
