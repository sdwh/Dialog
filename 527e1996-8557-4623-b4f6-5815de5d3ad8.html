How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. It's going well, thank you. How about yours?<p class=message>Not bad, thanks. I wanted to talk to you about the upcoming semester's course schedule.<p class="message sent">Yes, of course. What do you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, we're aiming to introduce some new courses this semester. One of them is an elective on contemporary literature. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That's sounds interesting. Who would be teaching it?<p class=message>We haven't decided yet, but I was hoping you might be interested?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't flattered. I'll definitely consider it.<p class=message>Great! And we also want to add a few more sections of the required courses to cope up with the increased student intake.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. We wouldn't want students struggling to get into the classes they need. What else have you got?<p class=message>We're also thinking about a new course on leadership and management in education. And, we're considering opening a specialized class for graduating students to prepare them for their career.<p class="message sent">Those sound like fantastic additions. We should also make sure that we prioritize reducing class sizes and providing more one-on-one time with professors for all our students.<p class=message>Agreed. We should also consider allocating resources for more internships and research projects for students. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was thinking that it would be a great idea to introduce a presentation skills workshop for students.<p class=message>That's a fantastic idea. In fact, we can invite alumni to come back to campus to conduct workshops on various professional skills.<p class="message sent">Exactly. I think that would really make our program stand out. Thanks for listening to my ideas, A.<p class=message>Of course, B. Your ideas are always welcome. Let's work together to make this the best possible program for our students.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=527dd636-3f00-4e46-b524-b1c380ddd6da.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
