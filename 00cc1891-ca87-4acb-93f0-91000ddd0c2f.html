Do you recommend anything in particular, B?<p class="message sent message-content">Welcome! We have quite a few specialty teas from the Mei County. Do you have any preferences?<p class="message received message-content">Well, I was hoping to try some oolong tea. What do you have?<p class="message sent message-content">Sure! We have a special oolong tea called "Golden Monkey Paw." It's quite popular here.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds interesting! What about black tea?<p class="message sent message-content">Our "Lapsang Souchong" has a strong and smoky flavor that is worth a try. You might like it.<p class="message received message-content">Hmm, I'm not sure about that smoky flavor. What other black teas do you have?<p class="message sent message-content">You might want to try our "Yunnan Golden Tips." It has an earthy and robust taste.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds more my style. How do you recommend I prepare it?<p class="message sent message-content">It's best to steep it in 95°C water for two to three minutes. And make sure to let it breathe a bit before drinking.<p class="message received message-content">Thanks for the tips! I'm excited to give it a try. You seem to know a lot about tea, B.<p class="message sent message-content">Well, I've been running this tea shop for over 15 years, so I've learned a thing or two about tea.<p class="message received message-content">Wow, that's impressive! Do you have any tips for brewing green tea?<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely. For green tea, use water that's around 80°C and steep it for one to two minutes. And make sure not to let it steep for too long or it might get bitter.<p class="message received message-content">Thanks so much for all the advice, B. I'll definitely be sure to stop by here whenever I'm in Mei County.<p class="message sent message-content">You're very welcome! And please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. I'm always happy to help tea enthusiasts.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=00cbefa3-de83-4389-9cdd-8165bd864070.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
