When do you think we'll be done?<p class="message sent message-content">I'm hoping we'll be done by the end of the month.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds great. Have you spoken with the client recently?<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, I actually had a call with them yesterday.<p class="message received message-content">How did it go?<p class="message sent message-content">It went pretty well. They had some questions, but overall they seemed happy with our progress.<p class="message received message-content">That's good to hear. Do you think we'll be able to meet their deadline?<p class="message sent message-content">I think so. As long as we stay on track, we should be able to meet their expectations.<p class="message received message-content">Agreed. By the way, have you had a chance to look at those new tools we got?<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, I took a look at them this morning. They seem pretty helpful.<p class="message received message-content">Awesome. Let me know if you need any assistance with them.<p class="message sent message-content">Will do. Thanks for offering to help.<p class="message received message-content">No problem. It's always good to work together as a team.<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely. And speaking of teamwork, do you want to grab lunch together later?<p class="message received message-content">Sounds good to me. Let's go grab a burger or something.<p class="message sent message-content">Perfect. I'll meet you in the break room at noon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0849f1e6-034e-497d-92f5-64239b9f0b88.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
