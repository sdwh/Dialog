I’ve been driving a taxi for about 10 years now. What about you? Are you visiting Wuhan for the first time?<p class=message>Yes, it’s my first time. I’m excited to explore the city. What’s your favorite place to eat here?<p class="message sent">Oh, you’re in for a treat! There’s a local specialty called hot dry noodles that you have to try. There’s a great place near the Yellow Crane Tower that serves the best ones.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! I’ll make sure to check it out. Have you heard any interesting stories from your passengers?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I once had a passenger who forgot their phone in my car. When I found it, I was surprised to see it belonged to a famous singer!<p class=message>Wow, that’s incredible. Did you get to meet the singer?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately not, but I did receive a nice reward for returning the phone to its owner.<p class=message>That’s a great story. Have you ever had any unusual requests from passengers?<p class="message sent">One time, a passenger asked me to drive around the city while they did some errands. It was a bit unusual, but I didn’t mind.<p class=message>That’s very helpful of you. You seem like a friendly and patient driver.<p class="message sent">Thank you! It’s important to me to make sure my passengers are comfortable and happy during their ride.<p class=message>I appreciate that. It’s been a pleasant ride so far.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I’m glad to hear that. We’re almost at our destination.
