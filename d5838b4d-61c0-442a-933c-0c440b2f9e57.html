Good morning! Can I help you with something?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Yes, please. I'm interested in learning about your hotel's promotion for the holiday season.<p class=message>Absolutely! We have some fantastic deals going on right now. Have you stayed with us before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. This will be my first time if I decide to book a room.<p class=message>Well, we'd love to have you stay with us! Our current promotion offers a 10% discount on all rooms, plus a free breakfast buffet every morning.<p class="message sent">That sounds pretty great! Can I make a reservation on the spot?<p class=message>You can definitely do that, or you can visit our website and book a room online.<p class="message sent">I'll probably do that, but can I ask if you have any recommendations on what to do here in town during the holidays?<p class=message>Sure! We have some great local restaurants and bars that are perfect for a night out, and there's also an ice skating rink just a few blocks away.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's amazing! I love ice skating. What about any holiday events or festivals?<p class=message>There's a local holiday market that's open every weekend, as well as a parade happening downtown next week. We also offer a holiday-themed cocktail class for guests.<p class="message sent">Wow, it sounds like this is the perfect place to stay during the holidays. Thanks so much for all the information.<p class=message>You're very welcome! We hope to see you soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d582f646-916a-4f03-a43e-e6f1302b54e4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
