What medication are you taking?<p class="message sent">It's for my allergies. It's called Loratadine.<p class=message>Ah yes, I know that one. It's important to take it exactly as your doctor prescribed it. Usually, it's only taken once a day.<p class="message sent">Should I take it with food?<p class=message>It doesn't matter if you take it with food or not, but it's important to drink plenty of water with it.<p class="message sent">What about side effects?<p class=message>Some people may experience drowsiness or dry mouth, but these side effects are usually mild.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. Can I still drive after taking it?<p class=message>It's best to wait and see how your body reacts to the medication before you drive. If you feel drowsy, it's best to avoid driving until the effects wear off.<p class="message sent">Alright, thank you for the advice. Is there anything else I should know?<p class=message>Just make sure to follow the instructions on the label and don't take more than the recommended dose. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c33036cd-8b3f-456d-a655-4d962fc0397f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
