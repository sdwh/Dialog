It looks so delicious.<p class="message sent">Yes, I just had it as an appetizer. It's quite tasty but a bit spicy for my liking.<p class=message>Really? I love spicy food. Let me give it a try. Hmm, it does have a kick to it, but the sweetness of the shrimp balances it out.<p class="message sent">Yes, I agree. The shrimp are so juicy and fresh. I think this is one of the best shrimp cocktails I've had in a while.<p class=message>Same here. And the presentation is spot on. The martini glass really adds a touch of elegance to the dish.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And I like how they added a slice of lime on top. It adds a nice tangy flavor to the shrimp.<p class=message>I think this shrimp cocktail would pair really well with a crisp white wine. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. Let's ask the waiter for a recommendation.<p class=message>It's great! Can you recommend a white wine that would pair well with it?<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect, we'll take a bottle of that.<p class=message>This has been a wonderful dining experience so far. Thanks for recommending the shrimp cocktail, it was definitely the highlight of the meal.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I'm already looking forward to coming back here and having it again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8d4b0585-734b-4d33-8cb5-02dbb176227d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
