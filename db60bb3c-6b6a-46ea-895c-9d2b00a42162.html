Welcome to our rainforest eco-tour. My name is Anna and I will be your outdoor guide for the day. What's your name?<p class="message sent">Hi Anna, I'm John. Nice to meet you.<p class=message>Nice to meet you too, John. Have you ever been to a rainforest before?<p class="message sent">No, this is my first time. I'm really excited to see all the plants and animals.<p class=message>You're in luck! This rainforest is home to many unique species. But first, let me give you a quick rundown of the tour. We'll be walking for about two hours, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring water.<p class="message sent">Got it. Two hours isn't too bad.<p class=message>Great. Now, let's get started on our adventure. Did you know that this rainforest is the oldest continually surviving tropical rainforest in the world?<p class="message sent">Wow, that's really interesting! How old is it?<p class=message>Scientists estimate it to be around 130 million years old. Pretty impressive, right?<p class="message sent">Definitely! What other interesting facts do you have for us?<p class=message>Well, did you know that some of the trees in this forest can reach heights of up to 200 feet?<p class="message sent">No way, that's taller than a skyscraper!<p class=message>Exactly. And keep an eye out for some of the animals too. We might spot some wallabies, kangaroos, or even a cassowary.<p class="message sent">Whoa, I've never heard of a cassowary before. What is it?<p class=message>It's a large, flightless bird that's native to this area. You'll definitely want to see one if you can!<p class="message sent">Sounds exciting. What else do we have to look forward to on this tour?<p class=message>Well, we'll be stopping at a waterfall later on. It's a perfect spot to take some pictures and cool off.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect, especially since it's getting pretty hot already.<p class=message>Yes, the humidity can be tough, but don't worry, the waterfall will be refreshing. And one more thing - don't forget to put on some insect repellent. The mosquitoes can be quite pesky.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Anna. I definitely don't want to get bitten by those.<p class=message>No problem at all. I'm here to make sure you have a fun and safe adventure. Alright, let's start our hike and enjoy the beautiful rainforest!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=db60956f-611f-4610-ba07-ba42d4391bb7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
