What book is it?<p class="message sent">It's called "The Art of Teaching."<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a great read.<p class="message sent">It definitely is. I've already learned so much from it.<p class=message>Speaking of A, did you hear about the time when he fell asleep during his own lecture?<p class="message sent">No way! How did that happen?<p class=message>Apparently, he was so exhausted from grading papers that he ended up dozing off mid-sentence.<p class="message sent">That's hilarious! I can't imagine falling asleep during my own class.<p class=message>Yeah, but at least he has a good sense of humor about it. He even made a joke about it the next day.<p class="message sent">A really seems like a great teacher.<p class=message>Absolutely. He has a unique way of making even the most boring subjects interesting.<p class="message sent">That's a sign of a true master.<p class=message>Definitely. Well, I should let you get back to your reading. I don't want to disturb you anymore.<p class="message sent">No worries. Thanks for the laugh though.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=550dbf6f-ff33-48c2-9638-c465f2579034.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
