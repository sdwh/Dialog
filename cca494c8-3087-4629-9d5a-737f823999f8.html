Beautiful day for some fishing, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! Looks like you caught something good there.<p class=message>Yeah, I got some fresh tuna and mackerel. Do you happen to serve those at your restaurant?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We love getting our seafood fresh and local. Where did you catch those?<p class=message>Just a few miles down the coast. The water was perfect for it today.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. How do you usually prepare your catch?<p class=message>My personal favorite is grilled with some lemon and herbs. But I've also tried making ceviche and sushi with the tuna.<p class="message sent">Those all sound amazing. We've got quite the variety of dishes we can make with these. Ever tried making a poke bowl?<p class=message>No, but I'm definitely open to trying new things. What's in that?<p class="message sent">Typically some diced raw fish, rice, and some veggies like cucumber and avocado. It's a customer favorite.<p class=message>That sounds really refreshing. I'll have to give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class="message sent">Of course! Thanks for providing the fresh catch. Can't wait to see what our chefs come up with.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cc94a1e9-5f4f-4131-bf62-468eea4c7fce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
