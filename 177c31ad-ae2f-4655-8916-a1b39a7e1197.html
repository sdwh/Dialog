How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hey A! I'm doing great, thank you for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well too! So, we need to discuss your upcoming performance. Have you decided on a theme?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I was thinking of doing a throwback theme. You know, performing old classics with a fresh twist.<p class=message>Oh, that's a great idea! Do you have any particular songs in mind?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm thinking of doing a retro medley of "Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees and "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor.<p class=message>That sounds like a hit already! We can add some amazing choreography to that.<p class="message sent">I agree! So, where do you think we should do the performance?<p class=message>What about an outdoor concert at the park?<p class="message sent">That’s a fantastic idea! The crowd would love it!<p class=message>Excellent. We can have some food stalls as well. The audience can enjoy some tasty snacks while listening to your amazing performance.<p class="message sent">I couldn’t agree more. Speaking of snacks, how about Taiwanese popcorn chicken?<p class=message>Wow, you seriously have a great taste in food! I love it! With that settled, let's work on promotion ideas.<p class="message sent">How about we share a teaser video on social media and create some flyers to spread the word around?<p class=message>Perfect! We also need to prepare your costume. What do you think of a 70s style outfit?<p class="message sent">Yes, that sounds great! Something colorful and groovy.<p class=message>Alright, we have a great plan in place. I'll work on the logistics and keep you updated. Can't wait to see you perform!<p class="message sent">Thanks A! I appreciate all your hard work. This is going to be an amazing performance!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1779e53c-4642-4d42-a14c-da89fcf8f3da.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
