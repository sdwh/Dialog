It's a standard for information security management, right?<p class=message>That's right! Do you know what the benefits are for a company to have this certification?<p class="message sent">Well, it could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their security measures, and give customers more confidence in their data protection.<p class=message>Bingo! And not to mention, it could also save them from costly and embarrassing data breaches.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that would be a nightmare! So, have you ever worked with ISO 27001 before?<p class=message>Yes, actually. My previous company was certified and it was a tedious but necessary process to maintain it.<p class="message sent">Really? What was the biggest challenge for you guys in maintaining it?<p class=message>I think it was keeping up with updates and changes to the standard, and making sure everyone in the company was following the procedures correctly.<p class="message sent">Ahh, yeah that makes sense. It could be tough to get everyone on board with protocols and guidelines.<p class=message>Definitely. But it's worth it in the end. Plus, it's a great selling point for clients to know that we're taking their security seriously.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, do you think our company should consider getting certified too?<p class=message>I think it's worth discussing with our higher-ups. It could set us apart from competitors and give us an edge in the industry.<p class="message sent">Yeah, let's bring it up in the next meeting. Thanks for the insight, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=904a2632-2b15-41d1-94f4-9a59b9aa70dd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
