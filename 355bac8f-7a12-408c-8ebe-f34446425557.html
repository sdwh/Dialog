How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, thanks. Just going through some coding here. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well too. I'm here for the ISO 27001 audit, and I was wondering if you could help me out.<p class="message sent">Sure, no problem. What do you need?<p class=message>Well, I was going over your code, and I noticed a few gaps in security measures.<p class="message sent">Oh no, really? What exactly did you find?<p class=message>It seems like you guys don't have any encryption or two-factor authentication implemented yet.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Our team had been planning to integrate those features, but we haven't had the chance yet.<p class=message>That's understandable. It's always a challenge to balance security with development deadlines.<p class="message sent">Definitely. But we'll make sure to prioritize those measures now that they've been flagged.<p class=message>Great to hear! And just to lighten things up a bit, I heard you've been working on a side project?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I've been working on a mobile game. It's a puzzle game with cute animal characters.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! Would it be okay if I tried it out?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'll send you the beta version once we're done here. Maybe you can give me some feedback.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. And speaking of animals, did you know that some people have trained their pets to type on keyboards?<p class="message sent">No way, really? That's hilarious. I might have to try that with my cat. They can be pretty smart sometimes.<p class=message>Yeah, who knows? Maybe one day we'll have a feline software engineer helping us out.<p class="message sent">Hey, you never know! Thanks for stopping by and pointing out those security issues. We'll make sure to address them ASAP.<p class=message>No problem at all, happy to help out. Take care, and keep me updated on that game!<p class="message sent">Will do. Have a good one!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=355b6cdf-cb71-401b-948f-a31e5b923d5d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
