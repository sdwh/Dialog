I heard you're working on a new research project. What's it all about?<p class="message sent">Hi A! Yes, I'm currently looking into the effects of caffeine on the productivity of chickens.<p class=message>Wow, that's interesting. How did you come up with that?<p class="message sent">Well, I was reading an article about coffee shops selling chicken sandwiches and it got me wondering if caffeine affects chickens in the same way as humans. So, I decided to test it out.<p class=message>That's a creative approach. So, what's your methodology?<p class="message sent">I have a group of chickens that I divided into two groups. One group receives regular water while the other gets caffeinated water. Then, I measure their productivity levels by counting their eggs.<p class=message>And what have you found so far?<p class="message sent">The results are pretty consistent. The group with caffeinated water produces about 25% more eggs than the other group.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive! Have you thought about expanding your research to other types of animals?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I'm planning on conducting similar tests with mice and rats to see if there's a similar effect. Who knows, maybe caffeine can be used to increase productivity in other animals too.<p class=message>That's a good idea. Keep me updated on your findings. And don't forget to drink your coffee before coming to the lab!<p class="message sent">Haha will do, thanks A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=34727a1e-1f2e-4e10-894c-3e0f50fefa78.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
