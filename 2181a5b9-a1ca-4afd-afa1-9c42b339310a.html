I am just stuck on this math problem.<p class=message>Let me see. Hmm, it seems challenging. Have you tried using the formula we learned last week?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. But something's missing. Maybe it's the multiplication.<p class=message>That could be it. Let's try it this way. (starts explaining)<p class="message sent">Oh, I see it now. Thanks, mom!<p class=message>No problem, son. (smiles) So, how was recess today?<p class="message sent">It was fun. My friends and I played tag, and I was it the whole time.<p class=message>(chuckles) That sounds like you had a great time. Did you also have your sandwich and fruit for lunch?<p class="message sent">Yes, and I traded my fruit with Justin for his cookies.<p class=message>(raising eyebrows) Oh, that's not a good trade. But I'm glad you had a good lunch. By the way, do you have any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Can we go to the park and play catch?<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea. We can also bring your bike and ride around the lake.<p class="message sent">Yes! And we can have a picnic too.<p class=message>Sure, we'll pack some sandwiches and fruits. It'll be a great way to spend the day.<p class="message sent">Thanks, mom. You're the best!<p class=message>(smiling) Aw, thank you, son. Now, let's finish this homework and have some ice cream.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=21766792-e2cd-4d5a-97a2-fbd946574f46.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
