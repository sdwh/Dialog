We've been targeting that demographic in our recent ad campaigns.<p class=message>Absolutely, and it seems to be paying off. However, our competitors seem to be catching up too.<p class="message sent">That's not surprising. We need to come up with something fresh to keep up the pace.<p class=message>I was thinking of incorporating some gamification elements into our next campaign. It could be a fun way to engage our audience.<p class="message sent">I like that idea! We could have a competition where customers submit their own video ads for a chance to win a prize.<p class=message>That could certainly generate buzz around our brand. And we could even use user-generated content for our future campaigns.<p class="message sent">Exactly! We need to think outside the box and stay ahead of the competition.<p class=message>Speaking of staying ahead, have you tried the new snack bar they have at the checkout line? It's delicious.<p class="message sent">(laughs) We can brainstorm about our marketing plan while munching on those bars. Sounds like a plan!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9a325e7a-3c63-44d2-8003-057b801a83a2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
