Playing XBOX Series X today, B?<p class="message sent">Yup, just started earlier. What games do you usually play on this console?<p class=message>I prefer playing action-packed games like Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty and Halo. How about you?<p class="message sent">I like those games too, but I also enjoy a good sports game like FIFA or NBA 2K.<p class=message>Oh, I see. I'm not really into sports games, but I can see why they're popular.<p class="message sent">Yeah, there's something about them that's really addictive. Have you tried playing any racing games on XBOX?<p class=message>Not really. I'm not the best driver in real life, so I thought it wouldn't translate well to gaming!<p class="message sent">Haha fair enough. But in racing games, you can be as bad as you want and not have to worry about real life consequences.<p class=message>True, maybe I should give them a try sometime. Have you ever played any horror games on XBOX?<p class="message sent">Oh no, I can't handle those! I get way too scared even with a game controller in my hand.<p class=message>Haha, I can understand that. But they can be really fun, especially when you have friends to play with.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I guess with friends it could be entertaining. Hey, have you heard about this new game that's coming out soon? It's called Cyberpunk 2077.<p class=message>Yeah, I've been following the buzz around it. It looks really promising, I might have to get it when it comes out.<p class="message sent">Same here. It's probably going to be one of the biggest games of the year. Speaking of which, have you pre-ordered the new XBOX Series X?<p class=message>Not yet, I'm waiting for some more reviews to come out before making a decision. Have you?<p class="message sent">I actually already pre-ordered it. I'm really excited for the 4K graphics and the fast loading times.<p class=message>Ah, nice! Maybe you can show me some gameplay on it sometime.<p class="message sent">For sure! It'll be great to have someone to play with on the new console.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c2416908-da1d-4942-80ec-1efbf751bf13.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
