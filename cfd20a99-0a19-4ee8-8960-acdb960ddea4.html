Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Hey, I'm B, the web designer. Pleasure to meet you too! So, what's our project for today?<p class=message>We'll be designing a website with a real-time interactive feature. Do you have any ideas on where we should start?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think we should first decide on what kind of website we're building. Is it for social networking or for business purpose?<p class=message>That's a good point. For now, let's plan for the social networking website first. How do you envision it to be?<p class="message sent">I'm thinking of something that's visually appealing and user-friendly. We can also incorporate the latest web design trends.<p class=message>Great idea. In terms of functionality, we need to have chat rooms, instant messaging, and video calling.<p class="message sent">Got it. I think we should also include some sort of "invite friends" feature to increase user engagement.<p class=message>Agreed. What about the front-end and back-end technologies that we should use for this project?<p class="message sent">We should use React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. They're widely used and have fantastic support in the developer community.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. We should also consider scalability when designing and building the website.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We don't want the website to crash when too many people are using it at the same time.<p class=message>Exactly. We should also keep in mind the security of the website to protect our users' privacy.<p class="message sent">Yes, we must prioritize security. Lastly, we should both be open about any ideas or concerns we have throughout the project.<p class=message>I completely agree. It's essential that we work together as a team to create the best website possible.<p class="message sent">Couldn't have said it better myself! Let's get started and create something amazing!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cfd0529a-e33d-4f4f-8b27-fa09d79109c9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
