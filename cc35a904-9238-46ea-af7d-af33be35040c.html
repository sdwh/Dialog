That's hilarious. Maybe we should add some funny marine life facts to the website.<p class=message>Good idea. We want to make sure the website stays engaging and informative for users.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Speaking of engaging, have you seen the new shark exhibit at the aquarium?<p class=message>No, I haven't had a chance to go yet. Is it worth checking out?<p class="message sent">Definitely. They have a virtual reality experience where you can swim with the sharks.<p class=message>Awesome! Maybe we can feature some VR content on the website as well.<p class="message sent">That's a great suggestion, A. I'll look into incorporating some VR features.<p class=message>Speaking of features, how's the database coming along?<p class="message sent">It's coming together nicely. I'm almost finished normalizing the tables.<p class=message>That's great news. I'm looking forward to seeing the end result.<p class="message sent">Me too. I think this website will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in marine ecology.<p class=message>Agreed. There's so much we don't know about the ocean and its inhabitants. Hopefully, this website can help us learn more.<p class="message sent">Exactly. I'm excited to contribute to this project and make it the best it can be.<p class=message>Me too. It's been great working with you, B.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. Let's keep up the good work and make this website a success.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cc341546-5cfc-48dd-9b24-f8a3866ef484.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
