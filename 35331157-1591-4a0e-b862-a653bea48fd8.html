The new recipe we're testing is delicious!<p class=message>That's great to hear. How are the measurements and timing working out?<p class="message sent">They're spot on! You definitely did a great job on the formula.<p class=message>Thank you. I'm glad I could help. Have you tried any new techniques for baking?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. I just found out about the cold butter method for making flaky croissants. Have you tried it before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. How does it work?<p class="message sent">You freeze the butter and then grate it into the flour mixture. It helps make the dough extra crispy while also keeping the butter in distinct layers. It's a bit more labor intensive, but the result is worth it.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I can't wait to try it out. What other techniques have you tried lately?<p class="message sent">Well, I just started experimenting with edible flowers as garnishes. They add such a lovely pop of color and flavor to the finished product.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I love the idea of bringing nature into the kitchen. What flowers have you been using?<p class="message sent">Mostly pansies and lavender. They're both delicate and full of sweet aromas.<p class=message>I'm impressed, B. You're always on the cutting edge of baking trends. I feel lucky to be working with you.<p class="message sent">The feeling is mutual, A. Your formulas always inspire me to create something new and delicious. Together we make a great team!<p class=message>Agreed. Now let's get back to baking. We have a lot of yummy treats to make today.<p class="message sent">Let's do it! Baking always makes my day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=352f56f6-1342-4b8e-9e01-c482affd6337.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
