Why do you ask?<p class="message received message-content">I'm planning a trip there and I was wondering if you had any tips on managing expenses.<p class="message sent message-content">Well, depending on what you want to do, the costs can add up quickly. Have you thought about creating a budget?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, I have, but I'm not sure how much I should budget for things like food, accommodations, and attractions.<p class="message sent message-content">In my experience, accommodations can vary greatly in pricing, so it's best to research and compare options. As for food, if you stay in a place with a kitchen, you can save money by cooking your meals.<p class="message received message-content">That's a great idea. Do you know of any must-see attractions that are worth the cost?<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely the Great Barrier Reef. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and it's important to choose a reputable tour company for safety and conservation purposes.<p class="message received message-content">I've also heard about the Kuranda Scenic Railway and Skyrail. Is it worth the price?<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely. The scenic views are breathtaking and it's a unique way to experience the rainforest. Plus, there are plenty of stops along the way for photo opportunities.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds like a plan. Is there anything else we should keep in mind?<p class="message sent message-content">Don't forget to factor in transportation costs, such as getting to and from the airport and renting a car if needed. And keep an eye out for deals and promotions on activities and accommodations.<p class="message received message-content">Thanks for the advice. I feel more confident about planning my trip now.<p class="message sent message-content">No problem. Have a great time in Cairns!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0c71176e-e997-46d1-9645-72ff3548d16a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
