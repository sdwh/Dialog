How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not bad, just thinking about the future of our fishing business.<p class=message>Same here. I think we need to start investing in more sustainable practices.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's not just good for the environment, but it's also good for our bottom line in the long run.<p class=message>I heard that the demand for locally sourced seafood is on the rise.<p class="message sent">That's great news! We should focus on promoting our catch in the local markets.<p class=message>Agreed. And what about technology? Do you think we should upgrade our equipment?<p class="message sent">For sure. The latest fish-finding technology can greatly improve our harvests and reduce wasted resources.<p class=message>Speaking of wasted resources, what about the issue of bycatch?<p class="message sent">We could look into using more selective fishing methods to reduce the amount of unintended species caught.<p class=message>Smart thinking. And let's not forget about the importance of maintaining our fishing grounds for future generations.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I think we should also consider investing in community-led conservation efforts.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. There's a lot of potential for growth in our industry, but we need to be smart about the way we do it.<p class="message sent">Indeed. It's exciting to think about where we can take our business in the years to come.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fe93bac1-af93-4b2b-a486-9dfdb05d56a8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
