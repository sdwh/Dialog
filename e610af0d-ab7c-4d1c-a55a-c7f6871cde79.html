How's it going?<p class=message>Good, thanks. How about you?<p class="message sent">Can't complain. So, I heard we need to work on automation of software deployment process for our new project.<p class=message>That's correct. I was thinking we could use Jenkins for that.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a good choice. How about the CI/CD pipeline?<p class=message>We could use Gitlab for the pipeline. It's easy to use and has great features.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. Do you have any concerns regarding security during deployment?<p class=message>Yes, I was thinking we could use Vault to store our secrets and credentials.<p class="message sent">Great idea. And for monitoring the deployment, we could use Grafana, right?<p class=message>Yes, that's what I was thinking. So, we are on the same page.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I think we'll need to make some changes in our infrastructure as well.<p class=message>Agreed. We could automate the whole process with Ansible.<p class="message sent">Perfect. And we'll need to write some test cases as well.<p class=message>Yup, we can use Selenium for that.<p class="message sent">Awesome. I can't wait to see this all in action.<p class=message>Me too. I think this will make our lives so much easier.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We'll be able to deploy our changes in seconds instead of hours.<p class=message>And we'll have more time to focus on developing new features or fixing bugs.<p class="message sent">This will increase our productivity for sure. Alright, let's get to work then.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e60e8560-4e31-4d9f-b7a3-36fc15934c45.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
