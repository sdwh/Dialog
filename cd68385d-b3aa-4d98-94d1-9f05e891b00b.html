How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too, Sir. I'm doing great, thank you. How about you? Are you excited to visit Perth?<p class=message>Yes, I'm really excited! I've never been to Australia before, have you?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have many times. Perth is a beautiful city with lots of great attractions to visit. Have you planned your itinerary yet?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I'm planning to visit Kings Park and Botanic Garden, Fremantle Markets, and of course, Rottnest Island to meet a quokka!<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great plan. Don't forget to try some of the local cuisines as well, such as meat pies and vegemite.<p class=message>Definitely! What's your favorite local food?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's tough, but I would have to say a classic Aussie BBQ with some juicy steaks and sausages.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! Do you have any favorite songs or artists from Australia?<p class="message sent">Yes, I really love the music of AC/DC and INXS. They are legends in Australian rock music.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard of them before. I'll have to give them a listen while I'm here. Do you have any funny driving stories to share?<p class="message sent">Well, one time I had a passenger who left his phone in the car. When he called his own phone to locate it, I answered and pretended to be his lost phone speaking to him, "Please return me to my owner". He was so surprised and we had a good laugh about it.<p class=message>Haha! That's hilarious. I'll try to remember to double-check my belongings before I leave the car.How much longer until we arrive in Perth?<p class="message sent">We should be arriving in about 30 minutes. Is there anything else you need to know or any help you need with getting around?<p class=message>No, thank you so much for your help and for the great conversation. I'm looking forward to exploring Perth!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, sir. Enjoy your stay and have a great time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cd675ad0-b0b5-43a3-b823-7b0503fccc86.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
