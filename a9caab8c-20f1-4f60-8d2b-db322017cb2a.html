What do you think, B?<p class="message sent">I think you're right. Maybe we could start heading towards that coffee shop over there to grab a warm drink.<p class=message>A warm drink does sound tempting, especially since it's been a long shift.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and maybe we could grab some donuts too. I hear their chocolate glazed ones are amazing.<p class=message>That sounds like a plan. Hey, did you see that man over there with the funky hat?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I saw him. His hat is certainly eye-catching.<p class=message>It looks like he's lost. Do you want to go ask if he needs help finding his way?<p class="message sent">Sure, let's go. Maybe we'll even get to wear one of those hats.<p class=message>(laughs) I don't think we could pull it off. Anyway, let's go talk to him.<p class="message sent">Hey there, sir. Do you need any assistance finding your way?<p class=message>No problem. Just down that way and take a left. You can't miss it.<p class="message sent">And while you're there, you should check out the new Monet exhibit. It's supposed to be amazing.<p class=message>No problem, sir. We're happy to help. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">(smiling) See, it's the little things that make our job worth it.<p class=message>Definitely. Now, let's go get those donuts and coffee. I'm starving.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a9c5c3bd-bac8-4390-9d0a-86fca28b74bc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
