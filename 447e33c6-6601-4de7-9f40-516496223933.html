How about you?<p class=message>Same here. But I always love a busy night because it means good tips!<p class="message sent">Haha, true. Speaking of good tips, have you tried the new special we're serving tonight?<p class=message>Oh yeah, the pan-seared snapper with a citrus beurre blanc? It's amazing.<p class="message sent">Glad to hear it! I had to run out to the market this morning to get the freshest snapper I could find.<p class=message>That's some dedication. And it paid off.<p class="message sent">Hey, we're a team here. You make the perfect wine pairings, and I'll make the perfect dish.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Which pairings are you recommending tonight?<p class="message sent">For the snapper, I think a crisp Sauvignon Blanc or a dry Riesling would be perfect. And for the steak, a bold Cabernet or a fruity Merlot.<p class=message>You have a way with words, my friend. I'll make sure to suggest those to my tables.<p class="message sent">Awesome. And if anyone wants to know the cooking process or what ingredients I used, just send them my way.<p class=message>Will do. And if anyone needs help choosing a dessert, I know just the person to consult.<p class="message sent">Who's that?<p class=message>Our amazing pastry chef. Have you tried her chocolate cherry cake yet?<p class="message sent">Stop tempting me, A. I'm trying to watch my waistline.<p class=message>Haha, good luck with that. It's too tempting to resist.<p class="message sent">You're telling me. But hey, we work in the food industry. It's practically our job to indulge occasionally.<p class=message>Amen to that. Cheers to another successful night at the restaurant!<p class="message sent">Cheers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=447da38f-402e-434e-a970-8d42ac942a69.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
