Can you tell me what it feels like?<p class="message sent">It's like a rollercoaster of emotions. You feel happy, scared, nervous, and excited all at once.<p class=message>That sounds intense. Is it worth it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Love makes life so much more meaningful.<p class=message>How do you know when you're in love?<p class="message sent">You just know. Your heart skips a beat when you see that person, you can't stop thinking about them, and you feel a deep connection with them.<p class=message>Have you ever had your heart broken?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it definitely sucks. But it's a learning experience and it makes you appreciate the good times even more.<p class=message>Do you think there's such a thing as a soulmate?<p class="message sent">I'm not sure, but I believe that there are definitely some people that we're meant to cross paths with in life.<p class=message>That's a nice way of looking at it. Do you believe in love at first sight?<p class="message sent">I think it's possible to feel a strong attraction to someone right away, but true love takes time to develop.<p class=message>I see. What advice do you have for someone looking for love?<p class="message sent">Be yourself, be open-minded, and don't settle for anything less than what you deserve. Love is out there for everyone.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c22a9973-56a3-4494-86b9-a4b8252af722.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
