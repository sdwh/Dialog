It's been quite the adventure!<p class=message>That's a long time. What's the craziest thing you've ever experienced on the job?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think...there was one time a couple of years ago when a guy got in my cab and asked me to take him to a wedding. When we got there, he realized he had the wrong address and we ended up driving around for hours trying to find the right place!<p class=message>Oh wow, I bet that was quite the ride for you. How do you manage to stay patient with customers like that?<p class="message sent">It can be tough sometimes, but I try to remember that everyone has their own story and their own reasons for needing a taxi. Plus, I get to meet all kinds of interesting people, like you!<p class=message>(laughs) Well, thanks for saying that. So, what do you like to do when you're not driving?<p class="message sent">I'm actually a big fan of photography. I love taking pictures of the city and its people. It's a great way to capture those little moments that make New York so special.<p class=message>That's really cool. Maybe you could show me some of your photos sometime?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'd be happy to! Hey, we're almost there. Is there a specific place you wanted me to drop you off?<p class=message>Yeah, just up ahead is perfect. Thanks for the ride and the great conversation!<p class="message sent">No problem, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b6ebfe1-44b7-4930-be23-123bfa7d21fb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
