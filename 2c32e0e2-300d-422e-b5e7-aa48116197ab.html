Do you need any help with repairs or regular maintenance?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. Can you take a look at the engine? It's been making some strange noises lately.<p class=message>Absolutely. We'll get that squared away in no time. What do you do to keep your boat in good condition?<p class="message sent">Well, I try to clean it regularly and inspect it for any damages. I also make sure the fishing gears are in good condition.<p class=message>Those are all great ways to upkeep your boat. Have you considered adding any new equipment?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been thinking about adding a radar system.
