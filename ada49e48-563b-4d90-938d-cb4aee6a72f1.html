It's great to be here in Okinawa and learn about the local cuisine and drinks.<p class="message sent">Yes, A! I'm so excited to share with you what I've learned and bring a taste of Okinawa back to our restaurant.<p class=message>What's the first thing we should learn to make?<p class="message sent">Well, how about we start with a classic Okinawan drink? How about a Shikuwasa juice?<p class=message>Shikuwasa juice? That sounds interesting. What's that made of?<p class="message sent">It's made from citrus fruit which only grows in Okinawa. It's sweet, tangy, and refreshing.<p class=message>Wow. That sounds perfect for our customers during summer.<p class="message sent">Yes! And it's also packed with Vitamin C.<p class=message>Great idea! What about for food? Any local specialties we should learn how to make?<p class="message sent">Definitely! We should try to make Okinawa soba. It's different from regular soba in that it's usually thicker and has a heartier taste.<p class=message>That sounds like a challenge, but I'm up for it!<p class="message sent">Don't worry, A, I'll help you every step of the way. We'll make the best Okinawa soba in town.<p class=message>I'm looking forward to it. So, what other drinks should we learn how to make?<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe Habushu?<p class=message>Habu-what? What's that?<p class="message sent">It's a traditional Okinawan spirit made of awamori (distilled rice liquor) and snake venom.<p class=message>Snake venom? Are you serious?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a bit of an acquired taste, but it's a unique and exotic drink that our customers may be interested in.<p class=message>Well, I'm all for trying new things. Let's do it!<p class="message sent">You got it. And don't worry, we'll make sure to follow all safety precautions.<p class=message>Phew, that's good to hear. You know, learning about Okinawan cuisine and drinks really makes me appreciate and respect the culture even more.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's important to learn and honor the traditions of the places we visit, and sharing it with others allows them to learn and appreciate it as well.<p class=message>Exactly, B. Let's continue to learn and bring a bit of Okinawa back with us to our restaurant. Cheers to that!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ada41515-f779-45d3-b348-e20a6156cfd8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
