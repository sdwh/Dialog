How's business going today?<p class="message sent">Not too shabby. The weather's been cooperating, and people have been stopping by to grab some snacks.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I was thinking, do you think we could collaborate and offer some tea with your delicious glutinous rice cakes?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great idea! What kinds of tea do you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, we have some traditional Thai teas like Cha Yen and Cha Kho, and some more unique teas like butterfly pea flower and lemongrass.<p class="message sent">Wow, those all sound so exotic. I think our customers would love to try them out.<p class=message>Fantastic! And for the rice cakes, do you have any special flavors or fillings that you recommend?<p class="message sent">Definitely try our taro or green tea flavored ones, and we also have coconut or red bean fillings that are really popular.<p class=message>Yum, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Do you think we could set up a little seating area for our customers to enjoy their treats and drinks?<p class="message sent">Of course! We want to make sure they have the perfect relaxing experience while enjoying our products.<p class=message>That's exactly what I was thinking too. I think this partnership will be great, and we can bring more attention to the amazing flavors of Thai cuisine.<p class="message sent">Agreed! I can't wait to see how it all comes together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=50de3202-cc57-43a1-ae39-d24ce89a5c1c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
