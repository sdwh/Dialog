How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thanks for asking. Did you have a good weekend?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I went hiking with my family on Saturday and watched a movie on Sunday.<p class=message>That sounds like a fun weekend. So, have you been keeping up with your studies?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. I've been reviewing the material we covered in class last week.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Speaking of last week's class, did you have any questions or concerns about the lesson?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I was a little confused about the difference between "affect" and "effect".<p class=message>Ah, I see. "Affect" is a verb meaning to influence or have an impact on something or someone, while "effect" is a noun meaning the result or consequence of something.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Thanks for explaining it to me.<p class=message>No problem. And speaking of words, do you have any favorite English words?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I love the word "serendipity". It means a happy or fortuitous accident.<p class=message>That's a great word. One of my favorites is "effervescent". It means bubbly and full of life.<p class="message sent">I like that word too. It's a fun one to say.<p class=message>Definitely. Alright, let's get started with today's lesson. We'll be covering verb tenses and their usage in different contexts.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=adcfab8e-ed5b-475c-a272-d3cc9197eb74.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
