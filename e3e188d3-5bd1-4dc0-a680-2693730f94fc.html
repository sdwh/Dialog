I'm the cargo handler for this flight. What can I help you with?<p class="message sent">Hey, thanks for your help. I'm the pilot for this flight. I have some questions about the cargo.<p class=message>Sure thing, ask away!<p class="message sent">I noticed we have more than a few boxes of live lobsters onboard. Are they for a special event or something?<p class=message>Nope, they're just a special order for a restaurant in Europe. Apparently, they're willing to pay top dollar for these little guys.<p class="message sent">Wow, I bet those lobsters are taking a longer trip than most of our passengers.<p class=message>Haha, yeah, they're definitely getting a taste of the high life in the air. Speaking of passengers, we have some extra seats in the cockpit. Interested in taking a break from loading boxes and flying with us?<p class="message sent">Are you serious? That would be amazing! I'll make sure the crew isn't expecting me for a little bit.<p class=message>Sounds good. Just let me know when you're ready. And don't worry, your lobster friends will be safe in the cargo hold.<p class="message sent">I appreciate it. How long have you been working here?<p class=message>Oh, long enough to know my way around a cargo bay. It's a tough job, but someone's gotta lift these heavy boxes.<p class="message sent">I hear you. My job has its challenges too, but I couldn't see myself doing anything else. The thrill of flying never gets old.<p class=message>Yeah, it must be pretty cool to see the world from up there. I'll stick to keeping the cargo safe for now.<p class="message sent">Hey, we all have our roles to play. And we couldn't do it without people like you. Thanks for your hard work.<p class=message>Aw, shucks. You're making me blush. Just doing my job.<p class="message sent">Well, you're doing it well. And now, let's ride off into the sunset, shall we?<p class=message>Ready and waiting. Let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e3ccbbcd-235b-4ca6-b346-c4e84bcc819f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
