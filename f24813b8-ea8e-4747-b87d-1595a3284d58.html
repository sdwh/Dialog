I heard you're a network security engineer. Could you help me figure out how to protect our network from cyber-attacks?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A! What kind of attacks are you worried about?<p class=message>Well, mostly DDoS attacks. They've been a real problem lately.<p class="message sent">Ah, DDoS attacks can be tricky to prevent. One solution could be to upgrade our firewalls and implement stronger access control policies.<p class=message>That sounds like a good start! What about data breaches? How can we ensure that our users' personal data is kept safe?<p class="message sent">We should encrypt our data at rest and in transit, and limit who has access to it. We can also conduct frequent vulnerability assessments to find potential weaknesses in our system.<p class=message>That's great advice, B. I'm sure our customers will appreciate having their information kept secure. Do you have any other tips for network security?<p class="message sent">Well, it's always a good idea to keep our software up to date and educate our employees on safe cyber practices. We should also have a disaster recovery plan in case an attack does occur.<p class=message>Awesome! Thank you so much for your help, B. I feel much better about protecting our network now.<p class="message sent">No problem, A! It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to network security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f238a77f-a911-498d-84d2-e113affc7d30.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
