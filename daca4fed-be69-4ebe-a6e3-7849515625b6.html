What do you think about it?<p class=message>I’m excited about it, but I’m a little nervous about maintenance.<p class="message sent">Oh, that’s natural. But, with any upgrade, there may be a few unexpected issues.<p class=message>Definitely. What do you think is the most important thing to be prepared for before the upgrade?<p class="message sent">I would say to backup all of our important data, just in case something goes wrong.<p class=message>Excellent point. How about we also schedule some time for training to avoid getting lost in the new system?<p class="message sent">That’s a great idea. The new features seem pretty cool. We wouldn't want to miss out on them.<p class=message>Yeah, exactly. Do you think the upgrade will take a long time?<p class="message sent">It’s possible. I already asked our IT guy, and he said they would try to get it done as quickly and efficiently as possible.<p class=message>Good thinking. We shouldn’t rush them, but maybe we could get some snacks for them to keep their energy up.<p class="message sent">(laughing) I'm sure they will appreciate that.<p class=message>Do you know what kind of maintenance would be required after the upgrade is complete?<p class="message sent">I'm not 100% sure, but I think we just need to keep an eye on updates in the weeks after.<p class=message>Got it. Do you think we should suggest any other solutions to our IT department?<p class="message sent">Maybe we can suggest a more detailed user manual and a help desk for any questions that may arise.<p class=message>That’s a great idea. I want to make sure this upgrade runs as smoothly as possible.<p class="message sent">Me, too. It sounds like we’re on the same page.<p class=message>By the way, have you tried the new coffee shop down the street?<p class="message sent">(laughing) I was wondering when you would bring that up. You know I'm always in for a good cup of coffee.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dac60a78-0acd-49ad-97f2-b6522fad2f6e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
