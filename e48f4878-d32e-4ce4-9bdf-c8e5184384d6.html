Thanks for meeting me today. Can I get you anything to drink before we start?<p class="message sent">No thank you, I'm good. But I must say, this caf√© has a really good vibe.<p class=message>Yes, definitely. So, tell me a bit about yourself. What inspired you to pursue your career in music?<p class="message sent">My parents were both musicians and I grew up with music around me all the time. I fell in love with it and decided to pursue it as a career.<p class=message>That's amazing. What kind of music do you enjoy playing the most?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I enjoy playing all types of music. It's hard to pick just one.<p class=message>I completely understand. Do you have any funny or interesting stories from your time performing?<p class="message sent">Actually, one time during a live performance, my guitar string broke and flew out into the audience, hitting someone in the front row! Everyone had a good laugh about it afterwards.<p class=message>That's hilarious! Have you ever had any embarrassing moments on stage?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, once I tripped and fell during a guitar solo. But I just got up and kept on playing like nothing happened.<p class=message>That's the spirit. What's next for you in terms of your career?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm currently working on my next album and planning a tour. So, lots of exciting things to come!<p class=message>Sounds great. Thanks so much for chatting with me today. It was a pleasure getting to know you better.<p class="message sent">No problem.
