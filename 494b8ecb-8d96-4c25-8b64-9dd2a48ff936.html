Nice to meet you. Are you ready for the audit?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. Nice to meet you too. Yes, we're all set. How can I assist you today?<p class=message>Great. Let's start by reviewing your network security policies. Can you tell me if you have any guidelines for password complexity?<p class="message sent">Sure. We require a minimum of 8 characters, with at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one symbol.<p class=message>That sounds good. By the way, what's your favorite symbol?<p class="message sent">(Laughs) My favorite symbol? Hmm, I guess it would be the @ sign. It's so versatile!<p class=message>(Laughs) I agree! Speaking of passwords, have you ever heard of passphrase?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's like a sentence or a combination of words instead of just one password, right?<p class=message>Exactly! It's a great way to create a strong and memorable password. For example, "My cat's name is Mittens!" is much harder to crack than "Mittens123".<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I'll make sure to recommend it to my colleagues.<p class=message>Great! Moving on to physical security, do you have any guidelines for visitors in your data center?<p class="message sent">Yes, we require them to sign a logbook, wear a badge, and be accompanied by our staff at all times.<p class=message>Good to hear. Now, let me ask you a fun question. If you could choose any fictional character to help you with network security, who would it be?<p class="message sent">(Laughs) That's an interesting question. Probably Tony Stark (Iron Man). He's a genius inventor and he can protect both the physical and digital world.<p class=message>(Laughs) Good choice! Alright, we're almost done. Do you have any questions for me?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. Have you ever audited a company that has a pet-friendly policy?<p class=message>Not yet, but I wouldn't mind! I'm a big fan of dogs myself.<p class="message sent">(Laughs) Same here. Maybe we should bring our dogs to the office someday.<p class=message>(Laughs) That would be awesome! Alright, thank you for your time, B. I appreciate your cooperation.<p class="message sent">Thank you too, A. It was a pleasure to have you here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=494aeb16-e3e1-4ecb-a9d7-e7d92230f164.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
