How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. So let's get down to business. I heard you have a new album coming out.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. I'm excited for it to be released.<p class=message>Great! We need to start planning a tour to promote it. What kind of venues do you want to perform at?<p class="message sent">I think it would be cool to do some smaller, more intimate shows at local theaters.<p class=message>That's a good idea. We can also book some larger venues for bigger concerts.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. By the way, have you tried the new sushi place down the street?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've heard good things about it.<p class="message sent">You should definitely check it out. It's delicious.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation. Now, back to the topic at hand. How many dates do you want to do for the tour?<p class="message sent">I was thinking about a 3-week tour. Maybe around 15-20 shows.<p class=message>Okay, we can work with that. What cities do you want to hit?<p class="message sent">Definitely New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. And maybe some smaller cities in between.<p class=message>Perfect. I'll start reaching out to venues and promoters to book the shows.<p class="message sent">Sounds great. By the way, did you see that funny cat video going viral on Instagram?<p class=message>Actually, I did. It was hilarious.<p class="message sent">Right? You gotta love the internet.<p class=message>Definitely. Anyway, I'll keep you updated on the tour plans as they develop.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. You're the best. I appreciate all your hard work.<p class=message>No problem at all, B. It's always a pleasure working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fc43b93d-64bf-4b25-b062-c4b4012f92bd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
