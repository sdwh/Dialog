May I know your name?<p class="message sent">Hello, my name is Jenny, and I run a candy shop down the street. Nice to meet you!<p class=message>Nice to meet you too. I heard that you are a candy expert. Do you have any tips for making traditional candies?<p class="message sent">Certainly! One tip is to make sure the temperature of the candy mixture is correct. Too hot or too cold, and the texture won't turn out right.<p class=message>That's really helpful. I guess temperature control is crucial in candy-making. Do you use any special equipment for your candies?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do. We have a special machine that helps us shape the candy into different shapes and sizes.<p class=message>That's interesting. How long does it take to make a batch of candies?<p class="message sent">It depends on the complexity of the design, but on average, it takes about 2 hours.<p class=message>That's quite a process. Do you only make traditional candies, or do you experiment with new flavors and designs as well?<p class="message sent">We do make traditional candies, but we also like to experiment with new flavors and designs to keep things fresh and interesting.<p class=message>Sounds exciting! Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Sure, we just came out with a new chocolate-covered strawberry flavored candy that has been a hit with customers.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. Do you ship your candies to other countries?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do. We have customers from all over the world who love our traditional candies and unique flavors.<p class=message>That's amazing! I'm sure your candies are a hit wherever they go.<p class="message sent">Thank you! We try our best to make sure our candies are of the highest quality and taste.<p class=message>Well, it certainly shows. Your store is always packed with customers.<p class="message sent">I appreciate your kind words. It's always great to hear positive feedback.<p class=message>It was great chatting with you. I learned a lot about candy-making.<p class="message sent">Likewise. Thanks for stopping by, and let me know if you ever need any candy-making tips!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a1a44e71-d96c-49c0-85a5-2fb3070defb8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
