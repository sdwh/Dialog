Excited for a ride to Paris today?<p class="message sent">Hey, yes I am! It's a beautiful day and a fun opportunity to hit the open road.<p class=message>Awesome. Have you been driving for long?<p class="message sent">Yeah, quite some time now. I used to be in sales, but I found that driving helps me clear my head and make a good living at the same time.<p class=message>That's great! You must have seen a lot of interesting sights along the way.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Some of my favorite memories come from the people I've met and the oddball situations I've encountered.<p class=message>What's the craziest thing that's happened to you?<p class="message sent">Hmm, it's tough to pick just one! I once had a passenger try to fit a surfboard into my cramped taxi. Let's just say it didn't go well.<p class=message>Ha! That sounds wild. Well, we won't be trying that today, at least.<p class="message sent">(laughs) No, that's for the best. So, what brings you to Paris?<p class=message>I'm meeting up with some old friends and doing a bit of sightseeing, including the Eiffel Tower, of course.<p class="message sent">Can't blame you there. And are you planning on practicing your French while you're there?<p class=message>I'll give it a shot, but my skills are a bit rusty. How about you?<p class="message sent">I know enough to order a baguette and a coffee, but that's about it!<p class=message>(laughs) Same here. Well, let's enjoy the ride and soak in the sights on the way to the City of Lights.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ab032772-1a3e-407c-b0f9-95f2ee4f13cb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
