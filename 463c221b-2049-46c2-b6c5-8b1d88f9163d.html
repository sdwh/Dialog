How long have you been a taxi driver in Taipei, B?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Around 5 years now, and I must say driving in Taipei can be both challenging and exciting.<p class=message>I agree, the city can be hectic, but it's also full of life. Do you enjoy the job?<p class="message sent">Definitely, I get to meet new people every day, and I enjoy hearing their stories.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, do you have any funny experiences you can share with me?<p class="message sent">One time, a passenger left a bag of groceries in the trunk. But instead of coming back for it, he must have had other things on his mind - he ordered a pizza from a different restaurant instead.<p class=message>(laughing) That's hilarious! I bet you have seen it all after five years on the job.<p class="message sent">Well, not everything, but I have developed some tricks on how to maneuver through traffic, and I have my favorite scenic routes.<p class=message>Ah, so do you have a favorite spot in Taipei that you like to show tourists?<p class="message sent">Yes! The Maokong Gondola is a great spot to visit for a panoramic view of Taipei. Plus, the tea houses up there have some of the best tea you can find in Taiwan.<p class=message>That sounds great - I'll have to check it out. Well, we are almost at my destination, B, thanks for the pleasant ride.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=463af573-a862-4e64-b006-03923a263889.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
