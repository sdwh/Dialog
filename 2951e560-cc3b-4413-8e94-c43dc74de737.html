I can't believe I get paid to take pictures of this all day.<p class="message sent">It never gets old, does it? But remember, we're also here to protect and conserve the wildlife.<p class=message>Don't worry, I won't step on any flowers. Speaking of which, do you know what kind of bird that is by the stream?<p class="message sent">That's a kingfisher! They're regulars around here.<p class=message>Beautiful little thing. I'll have to get a shot of it in action later. What other animals should I keep an eye out for?<p class="message sent">Well, we've spotted a few deer and foxes in these parts. You might even see a black bear if you're lucky.<p class=message>Wow, that would be something. Hey, can I ask you a personal question - why did you become a conservationist?<p class="message sent">Oh, I've loved nature since I was a little kid. I want to make sure there's still something left for future generations to enjoy.<p class=message>That's admirable. And I'm glad to be part of that mission, you know. I'll do my best not to get in the way of the ecosystem.<p class="message sent">We appreciate it. Now, let's get back to work. We don't want to miss the golden hour!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2951c472-12c8-4c41-9483-e023195382d9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
