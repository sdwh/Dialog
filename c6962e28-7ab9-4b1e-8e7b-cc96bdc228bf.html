I went hiking with some friends. How about you, A?<p class=message>I had a relaxing weekend catching up on some reading. So, about the designs, what do you think about the font choice?<p class="message sent">I like it, but can we try a bolder weight to make it stand out more?<p class=message>Definitely, I can make that change. And what do you think about the color palette?<p class="message sent">I love the blue and green, but can we add a pop of yellow to make it more lively?<p class=message>Good suggestion, I think that would work well. By the way, have you tried their cappuccino here?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it good?<p class=message>Yes, it's one of my favorites. We should order some and drink while we finalize the designs.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good plan. So, do you have any other recommendations for me to enhance the user experience?<p class=message>Actually, I think we can simplify the navigation menu to make it more user-friendly. And we can also add some illustrations to make the pages more visually appealing.<p class="message sent">Those are great ideas, let's make those changes. Oh, and speaking of illustrations, have you seen the new Marvel movie?<p class=message>Yes, I did! It was amazing. Have you seen it yet?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. I was planning to go this weekend, but I got caught up with other things.<p class=message>You should definitely go see it, it's worth the hype.<p class="message sent">I will, thanks for the recommendation. Alright, I think we have everything covered for the design. Thank you for your help and suggestions.<p class=message>Anytime, it's my pleasure. Shall we get some cappuccinos now?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c6918e9b-1b17-466d-82bc-8606e9cb4112.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
