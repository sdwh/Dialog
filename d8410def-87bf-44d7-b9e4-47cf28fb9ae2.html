I'm excited to be working with Vue.js, but I'm a little intimidated by how much I still have to learn.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, Vue.js is pretty easy to pick up. And once you get the hang of it, you can do some pretty cool stuff with it.<p class=message>That's good to hear. How about ASP.NET MVC 5? Have you used it before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've used it on a few projects. It's a pretty robust framework, but there are some quirks to it.<p class=message>Quirks? Like what?<p class="message sent">Well, for one, the routing system can be a little confusing. And the Razor syntax can take some getting used to.<p class=message>Ah, I see. But overall, do you think it's a good choice for our project?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I think so. It's great for building scalable and maintainable web applications. And since we're familiar with it, we can work more efficiently.<p class=message>Those are great points. Hey, what do you think about our team name "Code Warriors"?<p class="message sent">(chuckles) It's a little cheesy, but I like it. It's better than some of the other team names I've heard.<p class=message>Ha, I agree. And hey, maybe we can use our new website to showcase our team's projects and skills.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. It'll show our colleagues what we're capable of and maybe even inspire them to learn some new skills themselves.<p class=message>Exactly. Plus, it could be a fun way to bond as a team.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Yeah, nothing like some friendly competition to bring a team together.<p class=message>Agreed! Let's make this the best internal website our company has ever seen.<p class="message sent">I'm with you there. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d8408557-d8f7-43df-be33-88d2932ba94c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
