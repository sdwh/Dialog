What brings you to Atlanta?<p class=message>I'm here for a business conference, but I'm hoping to squeeze in some sightseeing while I'm here. Have you got any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out the Georgia Aquarium if you get the chance. It's one of the best aquariums in the world.<p class=message>Sounds great, thanks for the tip. How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">About 10 years now. I love being able to meet new people every day and hear their stories.<p class=message>That's really cool. Do you have any memorable stories from your time as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, too many to count. One time a passenger left their parrot in the backseat and I had to return it to them!<p class=message>(laughs) That's crazy. I'll have to be careful not to forget anything in here!<p class="message sent">No worries, I'll keep an eye out for you. Is there anything else you're looking forward to during your time in Atlanta?<p class=message>I heard the food scene here is amazing, so I'm excited to try some new restaurants.<p class="message sent">Definitely. There's a place nearby that serves the best fried chicken in town. You should give it a try!<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Thanks for being so helpful, you really know this city well.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. I love showing visitors around and making sure they have a great experience.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=81087016-e7ab-4a08-acb6-e7019d5d74c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
