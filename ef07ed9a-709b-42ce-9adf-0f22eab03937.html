What have you got for customers to wash down their delicious pastries with?<p class="message sent">Hey! We've got a variety of drinks, from traditional Chinese teas to freshly brewed coffee. What would you like to try?<p class=message>I think I'll go for a cup of fragrant tea. What would you recommend?<p class="message sent">How about our Jasmine Green Tea? It's light and refreshing, perfect for balancing out the richness of our pastries.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. And what would pair well with your Red Bean Buns?<p class="message sent">Our classic Black Milk Tea is a great choice. It's creamy and sweet, and will complement the sweetness of the red bean filling.<p class=message>Yum, I'll have to try that next time. How do you make your milk tea?<p class="message sent">We use a blend of black tea leaves, fragrant spices, and sweetened condensed milk. It's a bit indulgent, but worth the extra calories.<p class=message>Definitely worth it! Do you have any seasonal drinks on the menu?<p class="message sent">We just added a Winter Apple Cider with cinnamon and cloves. It's perfect for when the weather gets chilly.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I'll have to come back and try it. Thanks for the great recommendations!<p class="message sent">Of course, anytime! Enjoy your tea and pastries.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ef0796ca-fecb-4752-bb38-7fbe20d4c1d8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
