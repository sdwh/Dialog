How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hello, A! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. So, let's get started with the interview. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and what you do?<p class="message sent">Sure! I'm a professional clown. I entertain children and adults with my silly antics and performances.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun! Have you always wanted to be a clown?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Actually, no. I started out as an accountant but found it too boring. So, I decided to pursue my passion for making people laugh.<p class=message>That's quite a career change. Do you have any funny stories from one of your shows?<p class="message sent">Oh, there are too many to count! One time, I accidentally sprayed the audience with my water flower and everyone got soaked. We had a good laugh though.<p class=message>(laughs) I can imagine. So, what's your favorite part about being a clown?<p class="message sent">Definitely seeing the smiles on people's faces. It's a great feeling knowing that you can make someone's day a little bit brighter.<p class=message>Absolutely. Well, that's all the time we have for today. Thanks for the interview, B!<p class="message sent">Thank you, A! It was a pleasure talking with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=280a27c4-d116-4863-9515-8a6754f9cf89.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
