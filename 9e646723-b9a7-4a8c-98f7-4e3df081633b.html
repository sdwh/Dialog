Are you ready to pick some fresh fruits?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Yes, I'm excited to try my hand at fruit picking. What kind of fruits are we picking today?<p class=message>We're picking apples, pears, and peaches! They're all in season and ripe for the picking. Have you ever tried fruit picking before?<p class="message sent">No, this is my first time. Can you give me some tips on how to pick the best fruits?<p class=message>Sure thing! For apples and pears, look for ones that are firm and without any bruises. When it comes to peaches, look for ones that are slightly soft to touch and have a good aroma.<p class="message sent">Got it! This is such a beautiful farm. How long has it been around?<p class=message>Our family has been farming here for generations! It's a lot of hard work, but we love it. What brings you to Australia?<p class="message sent">I'm traveling and exploring different parts of the world. I've always wanted to see the beauty of Australia.<p class=message>You picked a great place to come. There's so much to see and do here. If you have some time, you should check out our local wineries and beautiful beaches.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! I'll definitely add those to my list. So, do you sell your fruits in local markets?<p class=message>Yes, we sell them at a few local farmers' markets. We also have a small shop on our farm where people can come and buy our fresh produce.<p class="message sent">That's great! I'll have to stop by and grab some before I leave. Thank you for showing me around and letting me pick some fruits. This has been a great experience.<p class=message>It was our pleasure. We're always happy to share our farm with visitors. Safe travels, mate!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e64520b-e45e-4968-8e47-f3cfdaa108b4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
