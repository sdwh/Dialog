How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, just checking in on some inventory and making sure everything is in order for tonight.<p class="message sent">Speaking of inventory, did we get in that shipment of truffles we ordered?<p class=message>Yes, they came in yesterday. Fresh from France. I can't wait to see what you come up with using them.<p class="message sent">Oh man, I have some ideas already. Truffle risotto, truffle butter for our steak, and even a truffle mac and cheese.<p class=message>Sounds amazing! You always come up with the best dishes. By the way, how's the new sous chef working out?<p class="message sent">Great actually. He's been a huge help with the prep work and he's really talented. He even came up with a new dessert that I think will be a hit.<p class=message>That's awesome to hear. I'm glad we found him. Speaking of desserts, did you hear about the new macaron shop that opened up next door?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I tried some of their flavors yesterday. They have some really unique ones like strawberry balsamic and lavender honey.<p class=message>Ooh, that sounds delicious. We should collaborate with them and do a macaron and sorbet pairing on our dessert menu.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Our customers would love that. Let's set up a meeting with them next week.<p class=message>Perfect. Well, I better get back to checking on the front of the house. Keep up the great work, B!<p class="message sent">Will do, A! See you later.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=247276c8-cfef-42bd-9c37-09eb60cf279b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
