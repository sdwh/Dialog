Yeah, I've heard of it. Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking maybe our company should get certified. It could enhance our credibility with clients.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. But do you know how long it takes to implement all those controls?<p class=message>Yeah, it can take a while. But think about all the fun we'll have trying to figure it out!<p class="message sent">Right, because installing firewalls and implementing access controls sounds like a party.<p class=message>Hey, we can make it a party! We'll have snacks and music and pretend it's a sci-fi movie.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's one way to make it interesting. But we also need to make sure we have a certified auditor to go through everything.<p class=message>Yeah, we don't want to mess that up. But we could get creative with the auditor. Maybe play a game of "find the security breach."<p class="message sent">(chuckles) Let's just stick to the standard format, okay?<p class=message>Sure, sure. But imagine how proud we'll feel once we're certified. We can put it on our resumes and LinkedIn profiles.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Yeah, and maybe even get a trophy for our efforts.<p class=message>(laughs) Okay, now you're really dreaming. But seriously, let's push our company to consider ISO 27001 certification.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Who knew information security could be so exciting?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9c114258-0478-4838-86d3-cf96c988a904.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
