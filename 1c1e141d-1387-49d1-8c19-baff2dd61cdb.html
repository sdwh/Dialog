I've never picked fresh fruits straight from the tree before.<p class=message>Well, welcome to the farm mate. We farmers take pride in our produce.<p class="message sent">You sure do. These grapes taste like heaven. What variety are they?<p class=message>Those are Shiraz grapes. They're very popular here in Australia.<p class="message sent">I might take some back with me to share with my family. Do you have any tips on picking the best grapes?<p class=message>Sure thing, look for bunches with even color and firmness. And make sure they're not too soft.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate the tip. What other fruits do you grow on this farm?<p class=message>We have oranges, lemons, and peaches as well. You can pick some if you like.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. I'll grab a basket and get to work.<p class=message>Take your time mate. Don't rush it. And if you need any help, just holler.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I will. By the way, what's that cute little animal over there?<p class=message>Oh, that's our farm dog, Rusty. He loves to play fetch.<p class="message sent">Hey, Rusty. Want to play catch with me?<p class=message>He sure does. You'll have a new best friend in no time.<p class="message sent">That's awesome.
