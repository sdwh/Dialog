How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. I think it's going to be a busy day today, we have a lot of customers already.<p class="message sent">Yes, it looks like it's going to be a busy day for both of us. I just finished making some new cakes, would you like to try one?<p class=message>Of course, I'm always up for trying new things. What kind of cake is it?<p class="message sent">It's a new mango and passion fruit cake, it looks and tastes amazing.<p class=message>That sounds wonderful, I'll grab one on my next break. Speaking of breaks, would you like a cup of coffee?<p class="message sent">That would be great, thanks A. Your handcrafted coffee always hits the spot.<p class=message>I'll brew you a fresh cup right now. So, how long have you been making cakes for?<p class="message sent">I've been making cakes for about five years now. It's always been a passion of mine, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to share it with others.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've been making coffee for about the same amount of time, and I love seeing the smile on people's faces when they take the first sip.<p class="message sent">It's the same with cakes, seeing people's faces light up when they see and taste something delicious is the best feeling.<p class=message>Absolutely. We make a great team, don't we?<p class="message sent">Yes, we sure do. I'm glad we can work together to provide our customers with the best experience possible.<p class=message>Me too. Well, I better get back to making coffee. It was nice chatting with you, B.<p class="message sent">Same here, A. Thanks for the coffee, and enjoy your busy day today!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6c31e74c-574c-4ac7-9dc1-b9a4867bc48a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
