What's on the menu today?<p class="message sent">Hi, Chef. We have a special dish tonight. It's our famous roasted duck with plum sauce.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds delicious. I can't wait to try it.<p class="message sent">Speaking of plum sauce, do you have any recipes you could recommend to me?<p class=message>Sure, Boss. I have a recipe for a homemade plum sauce that's easy to make and tastes incredible.<p class="message sent">That sounds intriguing. What ingredients do we need?<p class=message>You'll need fresh plums, sugar, rice vinegar, garlic, and ginger. It's a little sweet, a little tangy, and a little spicy.<p class="message sent">Sounds tasty. What else have you been working on in the kitchen?<p class=message>I've been experimenting with some new dim sum recipes. I'm working on a vegetarian dumpling that's filled with mushrooms, tofu, and black truffle.<p class="message sent">That sounds intriguing. Can I be your taste tester when it's ready?<p class=message>Of course, Boss. I always appreciate your feedback.<p class="message sent">That's why I hired you, Chef. You're always coming up with exciting new dishes for our customers to enjoy.<p class=message>Thank you, Boss. I love working here and creating new dishes for our patrons.<p class="message sent">And our customers certainly appreciate your hard work.
