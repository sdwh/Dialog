Today we will be talking about the history of two precious stones: amber and pearl.<p class="message sent">Good morning, teacher. That sounds interesting!<p class=message>Let's start with amber. Did you know that it was formed from the sap of ancient trees?<p class="message sent">No, I didn't. That's amazing.<p class=message>Yes, it is. And did you know that it was highly valued by the ancient Greeks and Romans?<p class="message sent">Really? Why was it valuable to them?<p class=message>They believed it had healing properties and also used it for jewelry and decoration.<p class="message sent">That's really cool! Now, what about pearls? How were they formed?<p class=message>Pearls are formed inside oysters and other mollusks. The process starts when a foreign object, like a grain of sand, gets stuck inside the mollusk.<p class="message sent">And then what happens?<p class=message>The mollusk secretes a substance called nacre to coat the object, which eventually becomes a pearl.<p class="message sent">I see. So, what did people use pearls for in the past?<p class=message>Like amber, they were highly valued for jewelry and decoration. They were also associated with wealth and royalty.<p class="message sent">Wow, I've learned so much today. Thanks, teacher!<p class=message>You're welcome. Learning about the history of these precious stones is fascinating, isn't it?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=223bbec7-507d-46bc-be28-b804080a2ad0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
