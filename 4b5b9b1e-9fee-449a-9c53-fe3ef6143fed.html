Just trying to get ahead on these project deadlines.<p class=message>Yeah, I know what you mean. So I wanted to talk to you about the progress we've made on the project so far this year.<p class="message sent">Sure, what's up?<p class=message>Well, we're about halfway through the year, so I was hoping we could go over the progress we've made each month and see if we're on track.<p class="message sent">Great idea. So let's start with January...<p class=message>Right, so in January we were able to complete the first stage of the project, which was a huge accomplishment.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and in February we were able to roll out that new software update, which was pretty seamless.<p class=message>Exactly. And then in March, we had a few setbacks with the testing phase, but we were able to catch up pretty quickly.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and April was really busy because we were trying to catch up from those delays.<p class=message>Right, but in May we were able to get back on track and finish up the user interface.<p class="message sent">And then in June, we finally wrapped up the testing phase and were able to launch the software successfully.<p class=message>Overall, I think we're doing pretty well. We may have had some setbacks, but we were able to recover quickly.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And looking ahead, I think we can keep up this momentum and finish the project by the end of the year.<p class=message>Perfect. Thanks for your input, B. Let's keep up the good work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4b58778f-dc14-4ec8-a7bb-e2ace5129129.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
