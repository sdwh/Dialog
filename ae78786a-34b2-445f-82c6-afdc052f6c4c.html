The instructor, A, really knows how to make the class fun.<p class=message>That's awesome to hear! What kind of poses did you learn today?<p class="message sent">We did a lot of stretching and relaxation poses. A even helped me perfect my downward dog pose.<p class=message>Nice! I've been meaning to work on my own yoga practice. Would you recommend A to a beginner like me?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! A is so patient and really takes the time to explain each pose. Plus, their calming voice really creates a relaxing atmosphere.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! How often do you take classes with A?<p class="message sent">I try to go at least once a week. The class really helps me destress and reconnect with my body.<p class=message>I definitely need to try it out. Do you have any tips for a beginner like me?<p class="message sent">Just be patient with yourself and don't push yourself too hard. A always reminds us to listen to our bodies and not overdo it.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. I can't wait to give it a try!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Let me know how it goes. Maybe we can go to a class together sometime.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ae782dec-5ffb-4ad2-baea-8551aa51e6a1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
