It's all about ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a lot of responsibility, but also pretty important in today's digital world.<p class=message>Definitely. And the certification process is no joke either. Have you heard about the audits and assessments?<p class="message sent">Oh boy, I can only imagine. But hey, at least it keeps companies on their toes and helps prevent cyber attacks.<p class=message>That's true. Plus, it's always a good feeling to know that your information is being safeguarded.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And it's not just for businesses. Individuals also need to be conscious of their own cybersecurity.<p class=message>Yes, even something as simple as using a strong password goes a long way. Let's not make it easy for hackers, shall we?<p class="message sent">Agreed! And with the advancements in technology, we need to constantly stay up to date with the latest threats and protection methods.<p class=message>It can be overwhelming, but as long as we take it seriously and incorporate good cybersecurity practices in our daily lives, we should be good to go.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And who knows, maybe we'll even become certified ISO 27001 experts ourselves!<p class=message>Haha, who knows indeed. But for now, let's just stick to being responsible and mindful about our own cybersecurity.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=700b35fa-f685-484c-9fe2-7e1879bd06b1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
