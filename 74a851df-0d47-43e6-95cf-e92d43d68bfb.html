How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you, A?<p class=message>I'm great! I'm excited to work on some new bread recipes today. What do you have planned for the café?<p class="message sent">We're introducing some new sandwich options, so I'm hoping you can work on some different kinds of bread that would complement them.<p class=message>Sounds like a great challenge! What kind of sandwiches are we talking about?<p class="message sent">We're doing a vegetarian option with roasted veggies and a spicy mayo, and a turkey and cranberry sandwich for the holiday season.<p class=message>Yum! I think I have just the breads in mind for those. Do you need me to bake anything for the dessert menu?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. We've been getting a lot of requests for something gluten-free. Can you come up with a delicious option?<p class=message>Of course! I'll experiment with some alternative flours and see what I can come up with.<p class="message sent">Great, I trust your expertise on this. Speaking of desserts, how did your pumpkin pie recipe turn out last week?<p class=message>It was a hit! Our regular customers loved it so much, we sold out within a couple of hours.<p class="message sent">I'm not surprised - your baking skills are top-notch. Have you ever considered entering a professional competition?<p class=message>I have! I've been eyeing a baking competition in New York City next year. It would be such a great opportunity to showcase my skills.<p class="message sent">I think you should go for it! You could bring home the trophy and bragging rights.<p class=message>Haha, thanks for the support. But even if I don't win, it's all about the love of baking for me.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit! We're lucky to have such a passionate and talented bread maker on our team.<p class=message>And we're lucky to have such a supportive and creative café manager. Let's make some delicious food today!<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=74a31a61-f674-45e7-b582-a005bb4ac95c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
