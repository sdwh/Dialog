I'm hoping to travel to Australia soon and I'm in the process of applying for a visa. Can you help me with the application process?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, I'd be happy to help. What type of visa are you applying for?<p class=message>I'm looking for a tourist visa. I want to explore as much of Australia as I can!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great plan. Do you have all the necessary documents ready? We'll need your passport, travel itinerary, and proof of funds for the duration of your stay.<p class=message>Yes, I've got all that together. I'm really excited to see the Great Barrier Reef!<p class="message sent">The Great Barrier Reef is amazing, for sure. But do you like to try surfing too? It's a popular activity in Australia.<p class=message>Surfing? I don't know how to surf, but I'm definitely willing to try new things!<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Maybe you'll even become a pro surfer by the end of your trip!<p class=message>Haha, we'll see about that. But I'm definitely looking forward to the beaches and outdoor activities.<p class="message sent">Have you heard of the kangaroo sanctuary near Alice Springs?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's that?<p class="message sent">It's a sanctuary for orphaned and injured kangaroos. You can even go on a sunset tour and hand-feed the kangaroos dinner!<p class=message>That sounds incredible. I can't wait to see all the amazing wildlife in Australia.<p class="message sent">And don't forget to try the meat pies and Tim Tams while you're there!<p class=message>I won't forget. Thanks so much for all your help with the visa application process.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Have a great trip and don't forget to send us photos!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=df7b3b12-781c-4ad9-bf5e-b8273919ae01.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
