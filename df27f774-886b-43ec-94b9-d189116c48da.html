Nice to meet you, what's your name?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm Jack, one of the cargo handlers here at the airport. Nice to meet you too!<p class=message>So Jack, I was just wondering, how do you guys handle the loading and unloading of cargo from our planes?<p class="message sent">Well, we have a pretty strict process we follow. We first inspect all the cargo to ensure it’s secured and properly labeled, and then use special equipment to load and unload them.<p class=message>Ah, that's good to hear. Safety is definitely a top priority for us. Speaking of equipment, have you ever had any unusual cargo that was difficult to handle?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, we’ve had a few. One time we had to transport a massive stuffed animal that barely fit in the cargo hold!<p class=message>(laughs) I can only imagine the looks on your faces. It must have been quite a sight!<p class="message sent">Definitely! We also once had a shipment of live lobsters that got loose and started crawling all over the tarmac.<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious. I’m sure that kept you guys on your toes. Speaking of lobster, what's your favorite seafood?<p class="message sent">I'm more of a sushi guy myself. But if I had to choose, I’d go for some grilled shrimp with garlic butter sauce.<p class=message>Now you're speaking my language. Grilled shrimp is the best! Anyway, thanks for sharing. It’s been great chatting with you.<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to help out a fellow industry professional. Safe travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=df27f65e-2b52-42ed-8490-ede684fcc3d6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
