It's one of my favorite desserts! How about you?<p class=message>I actually just had it for the first time and it was amazing. The layer of cocoa powder on top is the perfect touch.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And the smooth creaminess of the mascarpone cheese is just so rich and decadent.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. I love how it's not too sweet either, the espresso and rum really balance out the flavors.<p class="message sent">That's what makes a good tiramisu, the perfect balance of flavors.<p class=message>Definitely. It's such a classic dessert, I always feel sophisticated when I order it.<p class="message sent">Yes, and it's not too heavy either, so I can always enjoy it after a big meal.<p class=message>I'm glad we have a shared love for tiramisu. Do you have a favorite place to get it?<p class="message sent">Actually, I've only ever had it at this restaurant. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Oh, there's this amazing Italian bakery down the road that makes a phenomenal tiramisu. It's definitely worth a try.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendation, I'll definitely have to check it out! It's always good to have a few tiramisu options.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's the perfect dessert for any occasion.<p class="message sent">Couldn't have said it better myself. I'm already looking forward to my next tiramisu experience.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=04d4ef11-0193-49ef-a692-70faa82d8e9b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
