How are you liking San Francisco so far, B?<p class="message sent">I'm loving it! The bridge is so beautiful. How long have you been a driver?<p class=message>Thanks! I love showing people around the city. I've been a driver for about five years now. What's been your favorite part of the trip?<p class="message sent">I really enjoyed visiting Alcatraz Island. It was fascinating to learn about the history of the prison.<p class=message>Oh yeah, Alcatraz is definitely a must-see. Did you know that the island was also used as a lighthouse and a military fort?<p class="message sent">No, I didn't know that. Thanks for telling me. How long does it take to cross the bridge by car?<p class=message>It usually takes about 10-15 minutes, but if there's heavy traffic, it can take much longer.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's not too bad. I heard the bridge can get pretty windy, though. Have you ever driven in really strong winds?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It can be pretty scary, but luckily the bridge is designed to withstand wind speeds of up to 100 mph.<p class="message sent">That's good to know! I'm enjoying the view so much that I almost don't want to get off the bridge.<p class=message>Haha, I know what you mean. The view is amazing, especially on a clear day like today.<p class="message sent">Speaking of views, where do you recommend I go for a good meal in the city?<p class=message>There are so many great restaurants in the city, it's hard to choose just one. If you're in the mood for seafood, I recommend Fisherman's Wharf.<p class="message sent">Oh, I've heard of that place. I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class=message>You're welcome. We're almost at the end of the bridge now. I hope you had a great time!<p class="message sent">I did, thanks so much for showing me around.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d94a5f5f-ac88-48bd-b891-8ed93c02513c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
