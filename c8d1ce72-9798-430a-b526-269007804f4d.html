Can you believe we are finally heading to Australia?<p class="message sent">Good morning, mate! Yes, I'm excited to take you to beautiful Perth.<p class=message>Perth sounds like a great destination. Do you have any recommendations for what to do there?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! You must visit Kings Park, it has breathtaking views of the city. Also, don't miss out on the beaches and Fremantle market.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. Do you have a favorite spot to grab a bite to eat?<p class="message sent">As a matter of fact, I do. Cottesloe Beach has great seafood restaurants with stunning ocean views.<p class=message>I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Speaking of food, have you had any interesting taxi passengers recently?<p class="message sent">Yes, just yesterday I picked up a couple who were travelling with their pet parrot. It was hilarious hearing the bird mimic our conversation.<p class=message>That's hilarious! I guess anything can happen in a taxi. How long have you been driving taxis?<p class="message sent">I have been driving for over a decade now. It's a great way to meet new people and see new places.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. You definitely have a lot of stories to tell. What's the craziest thing you have seen while driving?<p class="message sent">Well, once I picked up a passenger who was dressed in a full-body chicken suit. He said he was on his way to promote a local restaurant's grand opening.<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious. You really do meet all sorts of characters while driving. We're almost at the airport now. Thanks for the great conversation and for driving us safely.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, mate. Have a great time in Perth! Don't forget to try some Vegemite while you're there.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c8d15af2-e465-4632-a686-49699c56a860.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
