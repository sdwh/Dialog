I'm so excited to see you all playing tabletop games here today. I'm a game designer, and I'm always happy to see people enjoying games.<p class="message sent">Hey, that's awesome! So what kind of games have you come up with recently?<p class=message>Well, I specialize in board games and card games. I recently released a game about pirates and treasure hunts - it's been a big hit so far.<p class="message sent">Oh, cool! Maybe we'll have to try it out sometime. Right now, though, we're in the middle of a game of Settlers of Catan.<p class=message>Ah, a classic. I love that game. Looks like you're having a good time.<p class="message sent">Definitely! We've been trading resources and building up our settlements all night. It's been really fun.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear it. Do you have any favorite games?<p class="message sent">Hmm...I'm a big fan of cooperative games. The ones where everyone works together to beat the game.<p class=message>Those can be really fun, yeah. I like games with a lot of player interaction, personally. It's always interesting to see how people react to each other's moves.<p class="message sent">Oh, for sure. Have you ever designed a game where players have to work together to achieve a goal?<p class=message>Actually, I have! It's a game about surviving on a deserted island - players have to gather resources, build a shelter, and find a way off the island before the storm hits.<p class="message sent">That sounds intense! We'll have to check it out. Thanks for chatting with us, A!<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. Have fun with the rest of your game!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8bba6adf-eef4-4085-9493-b73ffd47f0f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
