Are you enjoying your time in New York so far?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! It's been amazing. I'm really excited to see the Statue of Liberty.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that! The Statue of Liberty is an incredible sight to see up close. Are you ready to take some pictures?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! I want to make sure I capture the moment.<p class=message>Great! Let's head over to a good spot. Do you want to take a picture with the statue in the background or in the foreground?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I want the statue in the background. That way, I can show my friends I was really here.<p class=message>Perfect. Now, all you have to do is stand there and smile! The statue is quite photogenic.<p class="message sent">Wow, this is amazing. Thank you so much for bringing me here and showing me around.<p class=message>Of course, it's my pleasure. Do you know what the Statue of Liberty represents?<p class="message sent">I know she's a symbol of freedom, but I don't know too much beyond that.<p class=message>That's a great start! Lady Liberty is also a symbol of hope and opportunity. She was a gift from France to the United States in 1886 and has been a symbol of democracy ever since.<p class="message sent">That's really interesting. I'm definitely going to read more about it when I get home.<p class=message>I'm glad I could share some knowledge with you. Are you ready to move on to the next stop on our tour?<p class="message sent">Definitely! What's up next?<p class=message>How about we head over to Ellis Island? It's another important landmark in the history of New York and the United States.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! Let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aeca54c7-a3d2-4214-abce-d6c553bab507.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
