Great choice! Belgium has a lot to offer. Are you heading to Brussels?<p class=message>Yes, definitely. I've heard that the Grand Place is a must-see.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's a beautiful square surrounded by stunning architecture. And if you're a chocolate lover, you can't miss out on the chocolatiers there.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds great! What other cities would you recommend visiting?<p class="message sent">Ghent and Bruges are also popular destinations. In Ghent, make sure to check out the Gravensteen Castle and take a boat tour on the canals. Bruges has a beautiful historic center with charming cobblestone streets.<p class=message>Wow, those both sound amazing. Any recommendations for food?<p class="message sent">Of course! You have to try Belgian waffles and fries. And don't forget about the famous Belgian beers like Chimay and Duvel.<p class=message>Yum! Can't wait to try all of that. What about activities? Anything unique to Belgium?<p class="message sent">Well, there's the Atomium in Brussels, which is a giant stainless steel atom-shaped building with a panoramic view of the city. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can try bungee jumping at the Viaduct near Dinant.<p class=message>Sounds like there's something for everyone. Thanks so much for your help!<p class="message sent">Anytime! Enjoy your trip to Belgium!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=39a4cc97-ee4b-4565-b53c-c9bb9bcb89e2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
