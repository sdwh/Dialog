It’s a way for companies to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information.<p class="message sent">Sounds like an important thing to have in place.<p class=message>It definitely is! There are 114 controls in the standard, which cover everything from physical security to access controls to incident management.<p class="message sent">Wow, that’s a lot to keep track of.<p class=message>It can be daunting, but it’s important to stay on top of these things to protect sensitive information.<p class="message sent">Do you have any tips for staying organized with all of these controls?<p class=message>One thing that can be helpful is to categorize the controls based on which part of the information security management system they fall under.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I also heard that there are some software tools that can help automate the process.<p class=message>Yes, that’s true. There are plenty of tools out there that can help make compliance easier.<p class="message sent">It’s always good to have technology on our side.<p class=message>Absolutely! But it’s important to remember that technology isn’t the only solution. We also need to make sure that people are trained properly and aware of potential risks.<p class="message sent">You’re right. Human error is still a major factor in security breaches.<p class=message>Exactly. And by implementing ISO 27001 controls, we can minimize the risk and protect our company’s sensitive data.<p class="message sent">I’m definitely going to look into it further. Thanks for bringing it up, A.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help! Let me know if you have any other questions about it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=735da4a6-a9a5-45bf-8908-21ce7deda233.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
