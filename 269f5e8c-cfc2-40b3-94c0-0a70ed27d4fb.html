What do Australians usually bake or eat?<p class=message>Well, there are a variety of sweets that represent the culture of Australia. For instance, Lamingtons are one of the most traditional cakes. It's a sponge cake coated with chocolate and coconut flakes.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious. What about other desserts?<p class=message>Pavlova is another must-try dessert. It's essentially a meringue base topped with whipped cream and fruit. It's light and refreshing, perfect for a summer day.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. What's the story behind Pavlova?<p class=message>There's a debate on whether it's an Australian or New Zealand dessert, but the name is derived from a Russian ballerina named Anna Pavlova who toured both countries in the 1920s.<p class="message sent">Interesting. What about something savory with a hint of sweetness?<p class=message>You should try a meat pie with ketchup or chutney. The mixture of meat and sweet condiments is a classic Aussie combo.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's something new to me. What's the texture like inside the pie?<p class=message>The filling can differ, but typically it's minced meat with a gravy sauce that's wrapped in a pastry shell. It's a hearty and comforting food.<p class="message sent">I can imagine that being a perfect winter snack. Speaking of savory pies, have you heard of a sausage roll?<p class=message>Yes, that's another popular snack in Australia. It's essentially sausage meat wrapped in flaky pastry. It's a savory treat that you can easily find in bakeries or convenience stores.<p class="message sent">It sounds like Australians love their pastry. What about something not covered in pastry?<p class=message>Have you tried a Tim Tam? It's a chocolate cookie coated in chocolate and filled with chocolate cream. The best way to enjoy it is by doing a Tim Tam Slam.<p class="message sent">A Tim Tam Slam? That sounds fun. How do you do it?<p class=message>You bite off both ends of the Tim Tam, and then use it as a straw to drink a hot beverage like coffee or tea. The heat melts the chocolate and cream, creating a gooey and delicious treat.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great party trick. Thanks for introducing me to all these Aussie classics!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=26959707-ff7a-4038-a029-4c7b13eed39e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
