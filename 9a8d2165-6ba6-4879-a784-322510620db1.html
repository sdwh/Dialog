I hope you like it.<p class=message>That sounds perfect for a picnic. Did you make these sandwiches?<p class="message sent">Yes, dad. I saw a recipe on YouTube and thought of trying it out. They’re veggie sandwiches with lots of cheese and mayonnaise.<p class=message>Wow, they look yummy! You're turning into quite the chef!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Thanks, dad! I’m trying to learn new recipes and surprise you.<p class=message>Well, you’re doing a great job. So, how's school going?<p class="message sent">It’s going great, dad. In fact, I got an A on my last English test.<p class=message>That’s excellent, daughter! You’ve always been good at English. You know, when I was your age, I struggled with English a lot.<p class="message sent">Really, dad? I can't even imagine that. You speak so fluently.<p class=message>(laughs) Thank you. I had to work hard and practice a lot to get where I am now.<p class="message sent">That's inspiring, dad. Oh, look! There’s a group of ducks swimming in the pond. Let's feed them some bread.<p class=message>Good idea, daughter. Just make sure not to give them too much bread.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, dad. I read about it online. We should only feed them a few small pieces.<p class=message>You're full of surprises today. You're becoming quite the nature enthusiast.<p class="message sent">(giggles) Thanks, dad! I’m trying to enjoy life in every way possible.<p class=message>(smiles) That’s a great attitude to have, daughter. You never stop amazing me with your positive outlook on life.<p class="message sent">(blushes) Aww, dad! You make me feel so loved.<p class=message>You are loved, daughter. And spending this day with you in the park is what makes it even more special.<p class="message sent">(smiles) I feel the same way, dad. I love you.<p class=message>I love you too, daughter. Now, let's feed some ducks and enjoy our picnic.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9a8c6ce5-81db-40a3-ac20-dcc235daf983.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
