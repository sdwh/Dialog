B, did you do your homework last night?<p class="message sent">Oh no, sorry teacher. I had a really busy day and couldn't find the time.<p class=message>That's okay, but you will have to catch up with the rest of the class. I hope everyone else did their homework!<p class=message>Great job C, you are a very dedicated student. Now, let's move on to today's lesson. We will be discussing idioms and their meanings.<p class=message>Sure thing D. Here's one, "Don't count your chickens before they hatch", which means don't assume things will turn out the way you expect.<p class=message>Of course, how about "Break a leg", which is often said to wish someone good luck before a performance.<p class=message>It's actually because in theater, saying "good luck" is considered bad luck. "Break a leg" is a way to wish good luck without actually saying it.<p class=message>Absolutely, we will cover more in the next few lessons. But for now, let's practice using the ones we just learned in sentences.<p class=message>Great job H! Any other examples?<p class=message>Perfect, you guys are getting the hang of it.
