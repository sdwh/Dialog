What would you like to order?<p class="message sent">Hi there, I'd like to try your famous dan dan noodles and a classic milk tea with boba, please.<p class=message>Great choice! Our dan dan noodles are a customer favorite. Would you like them spicy or mild?<p class="message sent">I'll go for spicy, please. I like a bit of a kick.<p class=message>Noted. And for the milk tea, would you like any toppings besides boba?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about some grass jelly?<p class=message>Sure thing. So, what do you do for a living?<p class="message sent">I'm actually a milk tea maker myself. I have my own small shop in another neighborhood.<p class=message>Wow, that's so cool! What's your secret to making great milk tea?<p class="message sent">It's all about the quality of the tea and the right amount of sugar. And a bit of love, of course.<p class=message>I agree, you can definitely taste when something is made with care. We put a lot of love into our noodle dishes as well.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, what's your favorite noodle dish to make?<p class=message>I really enjoy making our handmade tomato beef noodles. The rich tomato broth and tender beef always turn out so delicious.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. I'll definitely have to try that next time.<p class=message>Definitely. So, what's the most interesting combination you've ever made for a customer's milk tea?<p class="message sent">One time, someone asked for blueberry and lavender syrup in their milk tea with aloe vera jelly. It actually ended up tasting really good!<p class=message>That does sound interesting. I'll have to experiment with some new flavors myself.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's always fun to try new things and see what works.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Here's your dan dan noodles and milk tea with grass jelly. Enjoy!<p class="message sent">Thank you so much. It looks and smells amazing. I can't wait to dig in.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=84afd816-c816-45f3-b419-ef3698866748.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
