How about you? How's your day going?<p class=message>My day has been good so far, thank you for asking. Now, let's take a look at your progress.<p class="message sent">Sure, I've been following the medication schedule you gave me, is there any improvement?<p class=message>Yes, I can see a significant improvement from the last time you visited us. So, what have you been doing in your free time?<p class="message sent">Well, I've been watching some TV shows and reading books.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. What's your favorite TV show at the moment?<p class="message sent">I'm hooked on a medical drama series. It's fascinating to see how doctors work and think.<p class=message>As a doctor, I can tell you that those shows are over dramatized, but interesting nonetheless. Speaking of which, have you eaten breakfast?<p class="message sent">Actually, I haven't. Should I have some food before the following treatment?<p class=message>Yes, you should have a light meal before taking the medication. There are some good cafeterias around the hospital, you can check them out.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'll do that. By the way, is there any update on when I can leave the hospital?<p class=message>We will check your progress for a few more days, and if everything goes well, you should be discharged soon.<p class="message sent">Great! I can't wait to go home and rest in my own bed.<p class=message>I understand completely. But remember, follow doctor's orders, and we will have you back to full health in no time.<p class="message sent">Of course, thank you for your help, Dr. A.<p class=message>You're welcome, B. It's my duty to ensure that you receive the best treatment possible.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fe03a34b-0660-45ca-8554-700c8f258408.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
