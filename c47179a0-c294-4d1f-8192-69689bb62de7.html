I've caught a few small fish so far.<p class=message>That's great to hear! What kind of bait are you using?<p class="message sent">I'm using squid as bait. What about you?<p class=message>I'm using prawns. They seem to be working pretty well today.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've heard that prawns are effective bait for a lot of different types of fish.<p class=message>Definitely. So, are you from around here?<p class="message sent">No, I'm actually just visiting. I'm from Melbourne.<p class=message>Ah, Melbourne. It's a great city. What brings you to Queensland?<p class="message sent">I just wanted to take a break from the city life and enjoy some time by the beach.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. Queensland has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, in my opinion.<p class="message sent">I definitely agree. The weather here is so much nicer than Melbourne's as well.<p class=message>Yeah, it can get pretty chilly down there sometimes. Have you tried any of the local seafood yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I heard the seafood here is amazing.<p class=message>Oh, it definitely is. You have to try the prawns and fish from the local fish markets.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely keep that in mind. Thanks for the tip!<p class=message>No problem. So, how long are you staying in Queensland?<p class="message sent">I'm only here for another week, unfortunately. But I'm definitely planning on coming back here in the future.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Well, I hope you have a wonderful time here and catch some big fish before you leave!<p class="message sent">Thank you so much. I'm having a great time already!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c469234d-98a1-4b57-8644-edc6ab6d34e3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
