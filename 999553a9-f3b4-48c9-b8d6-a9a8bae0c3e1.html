What brings you out here to the farm?<p class="message sent">Hi there, Farmer A! I'm interested in learning more about growing organic vegetables.<p class=message>That's great! We've been doing it for years. What would you like to know?<p class="message sent">Well, I've been reading about how to grow healthy vegetables without using harmful chemicals. What tips do you have for me?<p class=message>First thing is to know your soil. It's important to test the pH levels to know what nutrients are lacking and what is excess.<p class="message sent">Interesting. What type of soil do you use for your organic vegetables?<p class=message>We use compost, which is made up of organic matter that has broken down into soil-like material. It's great for soil health.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. What about pests and weeds?<p class=message>We use companion planting to naturally repel pests and manage weeds. Planting certain plants together creates a mutually beneficial relationship.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's really cool! What are some good combinations?<p class=message>For example, we plant marigolds next to our tomatoes to repel aphids, and basil next to our peppers to improve their growth.<p class="message sent">I'll have to try that in my own vegetable garden. Thank you for the great ideas, Farmer A!<p class=message>You're welcome, Chef B. Just remember, it takes time and effort to grow healthy organic vegetables, but it's worth it in the end.<p class="message sent">I agree. I'm excited to get started! Thanks again, Farmer A.<p class=message>No problem, Chef B. Good luck with your organic gardening!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99948747-e425-420b-adab-7ee4a9f060d2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
