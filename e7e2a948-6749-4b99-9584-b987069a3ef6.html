It's a standard for information security, right?<p class=message>Yeah, that's right. I'm trying to implement it in our company, but I'm having a hard time with the security controls.<p class="message sent">What's the problem?<p class=message>I'm having trouble understanding which controls are mandatory and which ones are recommended.<p class="message sent">I feel you. I was in the same boat when I tried to implement it in my last company.<p class=message>So, how did you figure it out?<p class="message sent">I just used common sense. If the control makes sense for our company and helps us protect our information, then we implement it.<p class=message>That's a good point. I'm just worried about compliance, you know?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but as long as you have a good reason for not implementing a certain control, you should be fine.<p class=message>That's true. Do you have any tips for implementing the controls?<p class="message sent">Yeah, start with the high-priority ones and work your way down. It's easier to tackle the big ones first and then move on to the less critical ones.<p class=message>That makes sense. Are there any controls you recommend we implement first?<p class="message sent">I would start with access control and then move on to communication security. Those are both critical controls.<p class=message>Okay, thanks for the advice. Do you know of any good resources for learning about ISO 27001?<p class="message sent">Yeah, there are some great online courses and books out there. I can send you some links if you want.<p class=message>That would be awesome. Thanks, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Always happy to help a fellow security geek out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e7dfe60a-eef2-464d-a774-e63f5db70da0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
