Today, we have a very special guest. B, can you please introduce yourself to our viewers?<p class="message sent">Hi everyone, my name is B, and I'm excited to be here today.<p class=message>B, we hear that you're an avid traveler. What's the best trip you've ever been on?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a tough one. But I think the best trip I've ever been on was when I went on a solo backpacking trip across Europe. It was amazing!<p class=message>That does sound amazing. Do you have any funny stories from that trip?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I ended up getting lost in a small town in Italy and had to rely on my very limited Italian to ask for directions. Let's just say it was quite the experience.<p class=message>Haha, I can only imagine. Now, switching gears a bit, we know that you're also a foodie. What's your favorite cuisine?<p class="message sent">I love trying all different types of cuisine, but if I had to choose, I would say Mexican food is my absolute favorite.<p class=message>Yum, Mexican food is always a good choice. And finally, do you have any advice for our viewers who are interested in traveling or trying new foods?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I would say to always keep an open mind and be willing to step out of your comfort zone. You never know what kind of amazing experiences or flavors you might discover!<p class=message>Wise words, B. Well, unfortunately, that's all the time we have for today. Thank you so much for joining us, B, it was a pleasure to have you on the show.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, it was a blast!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f80751a5-5d9f-4915-ada3-052198b07975.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
