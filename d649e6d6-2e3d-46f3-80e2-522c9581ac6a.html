How's everyone feeling today?<p class="message sent">I'm feeling pretty good, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. Now, today we're going to talk about idioms. Have you heard of them before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I think I have. They're those phrases that don't really make sense if you take them literally, right?<p class=message>Exactly! For example, "It's raining cats and dogs" doesn't actually mean that animals are falling from the sky. Can you think of any other idioms?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about "break a leg"? Does that one count?<p class=message>Yes, it does! It's a way of wishing someone good luck before a performance. Now, let's try to use some of these idioms in sentences. How about you give me an example?<p class="message sent">Okay, how about "You can't judge a book by its cover"?<p class=message>Great one! It means that you shouldn't judge someone or something based solely on its appearance. Can anyone else think of an idiom?<p class=message>Excellent! This means that if you wake up early and start your day, you'll have a better chance of success. Alright, let's move on to our next activity.<p class="message sent">That was fun! I never really understood what those phrases meant before.<p class=message>I'm glad you enjoyed it! It's important to have a good grasp of idiomatic expressions in English. Alright, let's get started on our next lesson.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d64191af-45fd-4a7a-ae86-a124d0714b5d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
