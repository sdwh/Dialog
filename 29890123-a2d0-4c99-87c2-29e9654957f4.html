It's driving me crazy!<p class=message>Ah, yeah, JavaScript can definitely be a bit tricky at times. Which part are you stuck on?<p class="message sent">I'm trying to get this if statement to work properly, but my logic seems to be flawed. I just can't figure out what's going wrong.<p class=message>Hmm, let me take a look. Maybe another pair of eyes can help. (looks at code) Oh, I see what the issue is. You're missing a closing bracket on line 17.<p class="message sent">Oh man, I can't believe I missed that. Thanks for catching it!<p class=message>No worries, that's why we have code reviews. And speaking of reviews, did you get a chance to check out that new restaurant that just opened up?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't yet. Is it any good?<p class=message>It's amazing! The pasta dishes are to die for. We should plan a team lunch there sometime.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. And by the way, have you seen the new Star Wars movie yet?<p class=message>Yup, I saw it last weekend. I thought it was fantastic - definitely one of the better ones in the series.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I'm planning on seeing it this weekend, and I'm looking forward to it.<p class=message>You're going to love it! And hey, if you need any code help while you're at it, you know where to find me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2988cb79-3485-45d6-b12a-1205494f7fef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
