How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I've been reading your manuscript and I have to say, I'm impressed.<p class=message>Really? That's great to hear! What do you like about it?<p class="message sent">Well, for one, your use of metaphors and imagery is really impressive. It makes the characters and the landscapes come alive in my head.<p class=message>Thank you, I've been trying to work on those skills. What about the plot? Is it too predictable?<p class="message sent">Not at all! You've managed to keep the readers guessing until the very end. I can see this becoming a page-turner.<p class=message>That's what I was hoping for! Do you think we need to make any major revisions?<p class="message sent">Nothing major, just a few minor tweaks. Maybe we could change the ending a bit to make it more upbeat?<p class=message>That's a good idea. I was worried that it might be too sad for some readers. What do you think about adding a love interest for one of the characters?<p class="message sent">Oh, I think that would be a great addition! It'll bring some more depth to the story.<p class=message>Okay, I'll work on that. Thanks for your feedback, B. I'm really excited to see where this will go.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. I can't wait to read the final draft.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f5a38cd0-b186-4941-85fe-eac90114d3b7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
