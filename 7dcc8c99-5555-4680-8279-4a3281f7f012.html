How's it going today?<p class="message sent">It's going great, A! Ready to serve up some delicious barbecue today?<p class=message>Absolutely! What's on the menu for today's lunch rush?<p class="message sent">We've got our famous brisket, pulled pork, and sausage links ready to go.<p class=message>Those are some of my favorite dishes to cook. I can't wait to see the customers' reactions.<p class="message sent">Speaking of customers, did you see the group of tourists that just walked in? They're probably looking for some Texas-style barbecue.<p class=message>Well, we better give them the best barbecue they've ever had! Let's get started on their order.<p class="message sent">Definitely! I'll go take their order and send it back to you in the kitchen.<p class=message>Sounds good. And hey, are you going to the staff barbecue next weekend?<p class="message sent">I wouldn't miss it for the world! Who's bringing the homemade barbecue sauce this time?<p class=message>I think it's J from the food truck down the street. His barbecue sauce is out of this world.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to try it! And maybe bring some home for my own barbecue party.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I might have to do the same. But for now, let's focus on making these customers' bellies happy.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's show them why we're one of the best barbecue restaurants in Austin.<p class=message>Alright, I've got the brisket ready to slice. Pass me those tongs, will you?<p class="message sent">Here you go. And I'll start getting the sides ready to go with their order.<p class=message>Perfect teamwork as always, B. We're going to make this lunch rush a success.<p class="message sent">You know it, A. Let's give 'em a Texas-sized welcome with some finger-lickin' good barbecue.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7dc2b50c-b772-4716-8dfc-bc303400d888.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
