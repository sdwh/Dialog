Yeah, she's been working really hard to get to where she is now.<p class=message>That's great to hear. And what about your parents?<p class="message sent">They're doing okay. They're planning a trip to visit some family members soon.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds like fun! Do they have any other trips planned for the future?<p class="message sent">Not at the moment, but they're always talking about wanting to travel more.<p class=message>I can relate to that. I love exploring new places! Speaking of which, have you gone on any vacations lately?<p class="message sent">Yeah, actually my partner and I went on a road trip up the coast last month. It was so much fun!<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I've always wanted to do that. Speaking of your partner, how are they doing?<p class="message sent">They're great, thanks for asking! They just got a promotion at their job, so they've been busy with that.<p class=message>Congrats to them too! You guys are both killing it with your careers.<p class="message sent">Haha, thanks! It's been a lot of hard work, but worth it in the end.<p class=message>Definitely!

I found a really good one for a spicy Thai soup that I can't stop making.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds delicious. I'll have to get the recipe from you sometime.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I can send it to you later.<p class=message>Thanks so much! And hey, don't forget to tell your family that I said hi.<p class="message sent">Will do!
