I'll do my best to help you with that. What's the reason for the change?<p class=message>Well, I just remembered that my niece's birthday is today and I don't want to miss it.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's understandable. Let's see what options we have for you. Would you like to change your departure time or the date entirely?<p class=message>I think changing the date would be best, if that's possible.<p class="message sent">Let me check for you. Yes, there is a flight leaving for the same destination tomorrow at 2 pm. Would that work for you?<p class=message>That sounds perfect! Thanks for your help.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Let me just check on the availability and price for that flight.<p class=message>No problem, take your time.<p class="message sent">Alright, there is availability and the price difference is only $30. Would you like to proceed with the change?<p class=message>Yes, please.<p class="message sent">Ok, let me just make the changes for you. All set! You'll receive a confirmation email shortly.<p class=message>Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, happy to assist. Have a great flight tomorrow and happy birthday to your niece!<p class=message>Haha, thank you! I'll make sure to pass on your wishes to her. Thanks again and have a great day.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=263a36b7-bb51-4884-9003-bef1e8a8ae24.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
