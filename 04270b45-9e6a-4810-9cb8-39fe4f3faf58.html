What's that about?<p class=message>Basically, it's a framework for businesses to manage and protect sensitive data.<p class="message sent">Ah, that sounds quite useful. Have you implemented it in your company?<p class=message>Yeah, we have. It's been great for keeping our data secure and organized.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. Is it a complicated system to set up?<p class=message>It can be, but there are plenty of resources and consultants available to help out.<p class="message sent">I see. Do you know if it's mandatory for all businesses to implement?<p class=message>It's not mandatory, but it's certainly recommended for companies that deal with sensitive information. It also enhances the credibility of the company.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. Is there anything specific that the ISMS covers?<p class=message>Yes, it covers things like risk assessment, security policies, and procedures for dealing with security breaches.<p class="message sent">It definitely sounds comprehensive. How long did it take for your company to implement it?<p class=message>It took a few months, but it was definitely worth the effort. It's made our data much more organized and secure.<p class="message sent">I might consider implementing it at my company too. Thanks for telling me about it.<p class=message>No problem. Happy to help out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=041adcb3-6e14-464a-95a7-aea180e92ad9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
