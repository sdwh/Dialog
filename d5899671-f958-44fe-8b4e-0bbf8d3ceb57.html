I hope you slept well last night?<p class="message sent">(sarcastic tone) Oh, absolutely. Bed and breakfast here are the best!<p class=message>(laughs) Come on, Mr. B. We just want to get to the bottom of this. Can you tell me why you were spotted near the bank last night?<p class="message sent">I was just taking a stroll, Officer. The night air is lovely, isn't it?<p class=message>(smiling) That may be true, but it's past midnight. I'm afraid we need a better explanation.<p class="message sent">Alright, fine. I was tempted to rob the bank, but I realized I left my mask at home.<p class=message>(laughs) Nice try, Mr. B. But seriously, do you have any information that can help us solve the break-in at the bank?<p class="message sent">(shrugs) Sorry, officer. You know I'm just a small-time thief. I don't have any connections to the big boys.<p class=message>Alright, Mr. B. We will continue to investigate. In the meantime, can we get you some breakfast?<p class="message sent">(smiling) That sounds good. I hope you have better coffee than my last cell.<p class=message>(laughs) We'll try our best. You know, Mr. B, you have a talent for making people laugh. Have you considered a career in stand-up comedy?<p class="message sent">(grinning) As a matter of fact, I have. But I always end up stealing the audience's hearts.<p class=message>(laughs) I think you should stick to your day job. But keep that sense of humor, it might help you in the future.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Thanks, officer. I'll keep that in mind.<p class=message>Alright, Mr. B. Let's go get some breakfast. But remember, you're still a suspect.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Of course, officer. I wouldn't have it any other way.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d5884626-2614-4565-827c-14ef8950ff5a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
