Are you headed to Madrid?<p class="message sent">Yes, ma'am! That's our destination today. How may I assist you?<p class=message>Well, I'm just a little nervous about my presentation this afternoon. Any advice on how to calm my nerves?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I suggest you take deep breaths and listen to your favorite songs. Those always help me relax.<p class=message>That's a great idea! You seem very calm and collected. Do you have any secret tricks?<p class="message sent">(laughs) I just try to focus on the road and have some fun conversations with my passengers. It helps to keep my mind off the traffic.<p class=message>Speaking of conversations, what's the most interesting story you have from driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">Oh, I have plenty! One time a famous musician hopped in my cab and we ended up singing his hit songs the whole ride.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. I hope I get a fun ride like that too.<p class="message sent">I'll do my best to make it enjoyable for you. Do you have any favorite music genres?<p class=message>Definitely pop music. What about you?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of classic rock. But I'm open to any recommendations!<p class=message>Have you heard of the latest hit by Dua Lipa? It's called "Levitating." I think you would like it.<p class="message sent">I haven't listened to it yet. But I trust your judgment. Let's play it now!<p class="message sent">We're almost there, ma'am. I hope you enjoyed the ride.<p class=message>I did! Thank you for the great conversation and the music. I feel much better about my presentation now.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Have a great day and good luck with your presentation!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=855e65d1-0c8f-4914-ae0b-9667bc0e700d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
