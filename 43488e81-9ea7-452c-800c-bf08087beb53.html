That's awesome! It's a great framework for making powerful web applications.<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm really interested in learning it. But I have no idea where to start.<p class=message>Well, the first thing you should do is download Visual Studio, which is the IDE used for developing ASP.NET projects.<p class="message sent">Got it, I'll download it right away. What's next?<p class=message>After that, you can start learning the basics of C#, which is the programming language used for ASP.NET MVC.<p class="message sent">That sounds logical. What are some good resources for learning C#?<p class=message>There are a lot of great tutorials online, but I personally recommend the C# Yellow Book by Rob Miles. It's free and really easy to understand.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely check that out. What should I learn after that?<p class=message>Once you've got the basics of C# down, you can start learning ASP.NET MVC itself. Microsoft has some great documentation that covers all the different components of the framework.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll make sure to go through that. By the way, do you have any fun projects I can do to practice my skills?<p class=message>Of course! How about building a simple web application that keeps track of your movie collection? You can create models for movies and users, as well as views for adding and editing movies.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea! Thank you so much for your help.<p class=message>No problem at all, happy to help! Just remember to take breaks and have fun with it. Learning new things can be a lot of work, but it's also incredibly rewarding.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4343a4e5-2738-48cb-9d4c-16584df5ae2b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
