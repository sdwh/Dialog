I've been doing some research on it lately.<p class="message received message-content">Same here! It seems like a great place to study, and I hear the weather is amazing.<p class="message sent message-content">Right? All those beautiful beaches would definitely make for a pleasant study break.<p class="message received message-content">Have you looked into any specific universities?<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, I've been considering the University of Sydney. What about you?<p class="message received message-content">I was considering the University of Melbourne. They have a really strong business program.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, that's cool. I was actually thinking of studying environmental science, so Sydney might be a better option for me.<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, I've heard Sydney is great for environmental studies. Have you looked into the campus life there?<p class="message sent message-content">Not yet, but I did hear that they have a lot of extracurricular activities for students.<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, I heard they have surf lessons, hiking trips, and even a wildlife society.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds awesome! I'll definitely have to check those out.<p class="message received message-content">Definitely. And have you looked into the cost of living there?<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, it seems a bit expensive, but I think with a part-time job and some budgeting, I should be okay.<p class="message received message-content">That's a good plan. And if you ever want to travel around Australia, there are plenty of ways to do it cheaply.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh yeah, I've heard of the Greyhound buses and the hostel system. I definitely want to explore as much as possible while I'm there.<p class="message received message-content">Me too! I've never been to Australia before, so it'll be a great adventure.<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely. And hey, maybe we can visit each other if we end up at different universities!<p class="message received message-content">Yes! That would be awesome. We could explore the city together and bond over our study struggles.<p class="message sent message-content">Haha, for sure. It'll be nice to have a familiar face around.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0d9311f4-27b2-4c6a-8c4f-48b8acdb1f50.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
