Thanks for meeting with me today. Would you like to order something to drink?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll have a cappuccino. How about you?<p class=message>I'll have a latte, please. So, let's get started with the interview. Can you tell us a little about yourself and what you do?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm an illustrator and I enjoy creating artwork for children's books. It's a lot of fun!<p class=message>That sounds like a really fulfilling job. What inspired you to pursue this career?<p class="message sent">When I was younger, I loved reading books and looking at the illustrations. I thought it would be amazing to be the one who creates those worlds for others to enjoy.<p class=message>That's awesome! Do you have any particular favorite books that inspired you?<p class="message sent">Yes, growing up I loved "Where the Wild Things Are" by Maurice Sendak. I also loved the illustrations in "Alice in Wonderland".<p class=message>Those are some classic choices! What's your process like for creating illustrations?<p class="message sent">First, I read the manuscript and visualize the scenes. Then, I make multiple sketches until I am satisfied with the composition. Finally, I use watercolor to bring the final illustrations to life.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work, but also really rewarding. Well, thank you for your time today and for sharing your process with us.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Thanks for having me!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=449eeb86-a87b-4091-8eb5-c7aacf8f247c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
