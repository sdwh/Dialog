How's it going?<p class="message sent">Pretty good, thanks for asking. It's always fun working on new coffee blends.<p class=message>I'm glad to see you're enjoying your work. So, what kind of coffee are we roasting today?<p class="message sent">Today, we're roasting a medium roast from Guatemala. It has a nice, balanced acidity with hints of chocolate and berries.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! I bet it will smell amazing as it roasts.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Our customers always love the aroma of freshly roasted coffee.<p class=message>Speaking of customers, have you noticed any trends in what people are ordering lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. There's been a big increase in the number of people ordering iced coffee since the weather has been getting warmer.<p class=message>I can understand that. There's nothing better than a refreshing iced coffee on a hot day.<p class="message sent">Agreed! And we've been experimenting with different flavors for our iced coffee, like vanilla and hazelnut. The customers seem to really like them.<p class=message>That's great to hear. It's always nice to offer a variety of options.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Hey, speaking of options, have you tried any of the pastries we just started selling?<p class=message>No, not yet. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Our gluten-free blueberry muffins have been a big hit. They're made with almond flour and fresh blueberries.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll definitely have to try one.<p class="message sent">Trust me, you won't be disappointed. So, should we check on the coffee beans?<p class=message>Yes, let's do it. I'm excited to see how they're coming along.<p class="message sent">Me too! Let's get back to work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=17db4d5e-ef84-4598-a2c2-9fbc8eefde83.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
