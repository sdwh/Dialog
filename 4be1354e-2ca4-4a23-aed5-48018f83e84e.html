Have you tried the minestrone soup here?<p class="message sent">Yes, I just had it for lunch. It's really good, isn't it?<p class=message>I'm actually thinking of trying it for myself. How would you describe it?<p class="message sent">It's hearty and flavorful. There are so many vegetables in it, like carrots, celery, and tomatoes.<p class=message>That sounds healthy! Does it come with bread?<p class="message sent">Yes, you can choose between garlic bread or a plain roll. I highly recommend the garlic bread though.<p class=message>Yum, garlic bread is my favorite. How spicy is the soup though? I'm not a fan of anything too spicy.<p class="message sent">No, it's not spicy at all. It's perfect for a chilly day.<p class=message>Great, that's good to know. Do you think it's filling enough for a meal?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I was full after finishing my bowl. In fact, I couldn't even finish my bread.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. I'll have to try it then. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem, enjoy your soup!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4be0ffae-1a01-4af6-9d8b-56801270f28d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
