How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thanks. Ready to start the day off with some delicious breakfast?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What do you recommend?<p class=message>How about our breakfast spaghetti with bacon and eggs? It's been a customer favorite lately.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! And what kind of coffee would you recommend to go with it?<p class=message>Our house blend espresso is always a good choice. It's rich and bold, and pairs perfectly with the bacon and eggs.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll have that then. So, have you baked anything new lately?<p class=message>Yes, we just started offering cinnamon rolls. They're soft, fluffy, and drizzled with cream cheese icing.<p class="message sent">Yum, I'll have to try one of those too. So, what got you into baking?<p class=message>Well, my grandmother was a baker and she taught me how to bake when I was a kid. I've been doing it ever since.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. I love hearing stories about family traditions being passed down. Do you have a favorite thing to bake?<p class=message>Definitely croissants. They're time-consuming and require a lot of technique, but when they're done right, they're absolutely heavenly.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. I'm more of a coffee guy, but I definitely love a good croissant too. So, what do you like to drink in your coffee?<p class=message>I'm a purist, I just like it black. But I won't judge you if you want to add some cream or sugar to yours!<p class="message sent">Haha, no worries, I'll actually have mine black as well. Cheers to a great breakfast!<p class=message>Cheers! Thank you for coming in and have a great day ahead!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a7e596d-c134-4667-9125-4763fbcb71c9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
