Thanks for meeting me for lunch today.<p class="message sent">Of course! I always enjoy our sisterly bonding time.<p class=message>Me too. So, have you decided what you want to eat?<p class="message sent">Hmm, everything looks good. Maybe I'll have a salad.<p class=message>Good choice. I think I'll go for the chicken sandwich.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds yummy. So, how has your week been so far?<p class=message>It's been pretty hectic at work, but nothing too crazy. How about you?<p class="message sent">I've been busy with school, but overall it's been going well.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Speaking of school, have you decided what you want to major in yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet. I'm still exploring my options.<p class=message>That's smart. You don't want to rush into anything.<p class="message sent">Exactly. So, have you made any plans for the weekend yet?<p class=message>Not yet. I was thinking about maybe going to the beach.<p class="message sent">Ooh, that sounds like a lot of fun.<p class=message>Yeah, I could use a little R&R. How about you? Any plans?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I might go see a movie with some friends.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. Well, our food is here. Let's dig in!<p class="message sent">Agreed. Thanks for having lunch with me today, A. It's always great to catch up.<p class=message>No problem, B. I feel the same way.
