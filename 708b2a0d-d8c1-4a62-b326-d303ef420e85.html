What brings you in today, B?<p class="message sent">Hi, Doctor. I've been feeling a bit under the weather lately. Lots of sneezing, coughing, and a headache.<p class=message>Hmm, I see. Have you been taking any medication?<p class="message sent">Yes, I took some over-the-counter cold medicine, but it doesn't seem to be helping much.<p class=message>Okay, let me take a look. Open your mouth wide and say "ahh."<p class="message sent">"Ahh."<p class=message>Your throat is a bit red and swollen, and you have a bit of a fever. It looks like you might have a cold or flu.<p class="message sent">Oh no, I hope it's not the flu, I heard it's going around.<p class=message>Don't worry, we can do a quick test to see if you have it. Meanwhile, make sure to rest, drink lots of fluids, and wash your hands frequently.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Doctor. I'll make sure to do that.<p class=message>And if you do have the flu, I can prescribe some antiviral medication to help you feel better faster.<p class="message sent">That would be great, thank you.<p class=message>Alright, let's do the test now. And remember, laughter is the best medicine. So, did you hear the one about the doctor who told his patient to stop singing "I will survive"?<p class="message sent">No, I don't think I have.<p class=message>He said, "It's just prolonging your flu!"<p class="message sent">[laughs] That's a good one, Doctor.<p class=message>Glad to hear it. Now, let's see that nose for the test.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=708adf06-6ebb-49e6-a0ab-a8db012bce76.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
