How's your day been so far?<p class=message>It's been pretty busy, but I'm glad to finally sit down and relax in this restaurant.<p class="message sent">Me too. This is a nice place. Have you been here before?<p class=message>No, but I heard good things about their food. Speaking of food, what are you planning to order?<p class="message sent">I think I'll go for the grilled salmon. How about you?<p class=message>I'm feeling like having some ribs. I heard they're famous for it here.<p class="message sent">Ah, that sounds delicious! So how's work been? Have you been busy?<p class=message>Yeah, we've got a lot of projects going on. But I'm glad we can take a break and enjoy some good food now.<p class="message sent">I agree. I always feel more refreshed after a good meal. Oh, speaking of which, have you seen our boss around lately?<p class=message>Funny you should ask. He's actually sitting at the table right next to us!<p class="message sent">Oh no, I hope he didn't hear me!<p class=message>*laughs* Don't worry about it, I don't think he did. Let's just enjoy our meal and not talk about work too much.<p class="message sent">Agreed. *pauses* Hey, this salmon is so good! You should try some.<p class=message>*tries some* Wow, that is delicious! Okay, after this we'll have to come back here again.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Oh, and I almost forgot to mention - did you hear about the company picnic next week?<p class=message>No, I didn't. What's happening?<p class="message sent">We're doing a scavenger hunt and barbecue. It should be pretty fun.<p class=message>That sounds like a blast! I can't wait to participate.<p class="message sent">Same here. Well, I think we should probably finish up so we can get back to work. But this was fun, I'm glad we could catch up!<p class=message>Definitely, let's do it again soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=76c3ab7f-6ae5-4990-9a81-faad63075e46.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
