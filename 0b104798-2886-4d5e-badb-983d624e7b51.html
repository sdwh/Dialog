Ready to do some safety checks?<p class="message sent message-content">Hi! Absolutely, that's what I'm here for. Are you ready to go through everything?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, definitely. Safety is always a top priority before we take off!<p class="message sent message-content">Completely agree! First, let's start with checking your seat belts. Is it securely fastened?<p class="message received message-content">Yep, it sure is! I double-checked before I sat down.<p class="message sent message-content">Excellent! Now, let's move to the oxygen masks. Have you ever tried that out before?<p class="message received message-content">No, never had to use it thankfully. But it looks easy enough to use.<p class="message sent message-content">Indeed, it is! You just need to pull it down and put it over your nose and mouth. And remember, always put yours on first before helping others.<p class="message received message-content">Got it, I will do that. Oh, and what about the exits? They are all clearly marked, right?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, they are. There are eight emergency exits on this plane - two at the front, four at the middle, and two at the rear. Please take time to locate your nearest exit and keep that in mind.<p class="message received message-content">Sure, I will. Can we move on to the life jackets now?<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely! If you take a look underneath your seat, you will find a life jacket. Put that on when instructed to do so and remember to pull the red tabs to inflate it.<p class="message received message-content">Fantastic! This is also my first time doing that.<p class="message sent message-content">That's quite alright. You'll be a pro in no time! Lastly, please ensure that your seat is in its upright position with your tray table stowed and your window shades up.<p class="message received message-content">Understood. Thanks for walking me through this. I feel safe and prepped for any emergencies now!<p class="message sent message-content">It was my pleasure. Always remember, safety first and have a pleasant flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0b0b4d94-9567-488d-9c90-741c8dddc4c4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
