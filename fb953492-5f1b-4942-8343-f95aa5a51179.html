I'm a food processing worker. I heard you run a candy store. How's business?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, I am a candy store owner. Business has been good despite the pandemic. People still have a sweet tooth.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So what type of candy do you sell here?<p class="message sent">We sell traditional Chaozhou candy. It's made from maltose syrup and is known for being chewy and sweet.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! I work with food all day, and it's nice to see that there are traditional and authentic candy makers out there.<p class="message sent">Yes, we pride ourselves on keeping the traditional methods of candy making alive.<p class=message>That's really admirable. So, can you tell me more about maltose syrup and how it's used in candy making?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Maltose syrup is a natural sweetener made from malted grain, usually barley. It's heated and broken down into a syrup that's perfect for candy. We mix it with water and other ingredients like flavorings to make different types of candy.<p class=message>Hmmm, that's really interesting. I wouldn't have guessed that maltose syrup came from barley!<p class="message sent">Yes, it's quite fascinating how different ingredients can come together to make something so tasty.<p class=message>Speaking of which, can I try one of your candies?<p class="message sent">Of course! Which one would you like to try?<p class=message>Hmm, how about the coconut flavored one?<p class="message sent">Great choice! Here you go.<p class=message>*chewing* This is really good!<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it. It's one of our best sellers.<p class=message>I can see why. This would be a perfect gift for my friends and family.<p class="message sent">Definitely! We have many different flavors to choose from, so you can mix and match to make a gift basket.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. Thank you so much for sharing all of this with me.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It's always nice to chat with someone who appreciates traditional candy making.<p class=message>It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day!<p class="message sent">You too! Don't forget to come back and try some other flavors.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fb8bdbf4-3af0-442d-8ccc-54923c281507.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
