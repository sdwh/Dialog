What were you thinking?<p class="message sent">Well, we've been getting some feedback from our passengers that they would like to see more vegetarian options on our flights. Do you have any suggestions?<p class=message>Absolutely! We have a really popular roasted vegetable wrap that I think your passengers would love. It's packed with flavor and easy to eat on the go.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. What about for breakfast?<p class=message>For breakfast, we offer a variety of options like yogurt parfaits and fresh fruit cups. Our oatmeal with a side of honey and fresh berries is also a hit.<p class="message sent">Wow, those all sound delicious. How about for a more decadent option?<p class=message>We have a chocolate croissant that always goes down well. It's flaky and indulgent without being too heavy.<p class="message sent">Oh, yum! And what about drinks?<p class=message>We have a range of hot and cold options, from freshly brewed coffee and tea to juices and sodas. And let's not forget about the complimentary mini bottles of wine!<p class="message sent">I think our passengers will be thrilled with these options. Thanks for your help and suggestions!<p class=message>You're welcome! Let us know if there's anything else we can do to make your passengers' experience even better.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks again!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=caa1f841-a9bd-46da-ae02-e7de825ae824.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
