How's it going so far with the audit?<p class="message sent">Hey there, A! It's been a little intense, but we're making progress.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Are there any particular areas you're having trouble with?<p class="message sent">Well, some of the technical requirements are proving to be a bit of a challenge for our team. But we're working through them.<p class=message>Ah, yes. The technical aspects can be tricky. Have you tried reaching out to any of the external teams for support?<p class="message sent">Actually, we have. We've been in contact with the security team, and they've been a huge help with some of the more complicated issues.<p class=message>That's great to hear! It's always good to have a strong network for support.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's not just about following the ISO standards, but doing it in a way that is effective for our company and our clients.<p class=message>Definitely. And it's not always easy to strike that balance.<p class="message sent">No, it's not. But I think we're making good progress. Plus, it's important to remember that we can still have a little fun along the way.<p class=message>Absolutely! Sometimes a little lightheartedness can go a long way.<p class="message sent">Yes, it can. So, you got any plans for the weekend, A?<p class=message>Actually, I do. I'm going hiking with some friends. What about you?<p class="message sent">Oh nice! I'm just planning on taking it easy and catching up on some reading.<p class=message>Sounds like a good plan. Well, keep up the good work with the audit, B. And enjoy your weekend!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! You too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8222a6a8-9a21-4cba-ac73-f432ffd1ba29.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
