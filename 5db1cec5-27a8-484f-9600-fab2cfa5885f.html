How are you all feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Sir! I'm feeling great, thanks for asking.<p class=message>Glad to hear that. So, today we'll be talking about famous inventors. Can anyone name a famous inventor?<p class="message sent">Thomas Edison, Sir! I heard he invented the light bulb.<p class=message>Excellent! Yes, Thomas Edison was a famous inventor who indeed invented the light bulb. Can you tell us one of his famous quotes?<p class="message sent">"I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work."<p class=message>Very good, B. Edison was a man of perseverance. Did you know that he also invented the phonograph and motion picture camera?<p class="message sent">No, I didn't. He must have been a genius.<p class=message>He definitely was. What about you? Will you invent something someday?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not sure. But I'll try my best to contribute something to the world, Sir!<p class=message>That's the spirit! Always aim high, and who knows, you might even surpass Edison someday.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I highly doubt that, Sir. But I'll surely do my best.<p class=message>Very well said, B. Alright, let's move on to our class activity. I want you all to think of an invention that could make our lives easier.<p class="message sent">Can we work in groups, Sir?<p class=message>Of course! Just make sure that each member contributes equally.<p class=message>Alright, let's wrap it up now. Good job, everyone! Don't forget to submit your inventions on Monday.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Sir! This was a fun activity.
