I heard you're a game developer, what's the latest project you're working on?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, I am. I'm currently designing a new RPG game. It's going to be epic!<p class=message>Wow, sounds exciting! Can you give me a taste of what kind of characters we can expect to see in the game?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! So far, I have a fearless knight, a cunning rogue, and a wise wizard. And I'm still brainstorming for more.<p class=message>That's awesome! How about adding a ninja into the mix? Or maybe a pirate?<p class="message sent">Great idea! I love the creativity. Who knows? We might just have a ninja or pirate as one of the characters.<p class=message>Speaking of characters, how do you come up with their names?<p class="message sent">I usually research different cultures and mythologies for inspiration. But sometimes, I just pick random words and make them into unique names.<p class=message>Sounds like a fun process. How about the game mechanics? What can we expect from the gameplay?<p class="message sent">Well, the players will have the freedom to choose their own path and make decisions that will affect the game's outcome. It will also have a leveling system and skill tree, so players can customize their characters to their liking.<p class=message>That sounds quite immersive! Can't wait to try it out. When do you plan to release it?<p class="message sent">We're aiming to release it next year. But we want to make sure it's perfect before launching it.<p class=message>Good idea. I believe it's definitely worth the wait. Thanks for chatting with me about the game. Can't wait to see it come to life!<p class="message sent">Anytime! It's my pleasure to share my passion with others.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1611bcd9-55b4-4543-add6-7b52343f1aa7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
