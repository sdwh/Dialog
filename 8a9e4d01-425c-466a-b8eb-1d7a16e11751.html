You seem pretty busy today.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm just going through your latest manuscript. Great job, by the way!<p class=message>Thanks, I really appreciate it. So, did you find any major issues?<p class="message sent">Not really, just a couple of minor typos and grammatical errors.<p class=message>Alright, let me fix those quickly. But hey, did you like the plot?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I think it's quite unique and I'm sure readers will love it.<p class=message>That's what I was hoping for. But speaking of readers, how many copies do you think we should print for the first run?<p class="message sent">Well, based on your previous book sales figures, I think we can start with 20,000 copies.<p class=message>Wow, that's ambitious. But I like it! Hopefully, we can get some good reviews and even more sales.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And have you thought of any interesting promotional events we can do?<p class=message>Yeah, I was thinking of hosting a book signing event at a local bookstore. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great idea. And maybe we can also do a giveaway on social media.<p class=message>Oh, good idea! I'll make sure to include that in our marketing plan.<p class="message sent">Speaking of plans, have you started working on your next book yet?<p class=message>Not really, I'm still brainstorming ideas. But I do have an interesting concept in mind.<p class="message sent">Ooh, can you give me a sneak peek?<p class=message>Sure, it's a sci-fi story set in the future where humans live on Mars.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Can't wait to read it!<p class=message>Thanks, it's still in the very early stages, but I'll keep you updated.<p class="message sent">Alright, looking forward to it. Keep up the great work A!<p class=message>Thanks, B!
