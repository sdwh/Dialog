How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I need some legal advice. I am starting a new business and I need help with the legal structure.<p class=message>Sure, we can help with that. Have you decided on the type of business entity you want to create?<p class="message sent">Not yet. I was hoping you could guide me through the options.<p class=message>Absolutely. First, we have a sole proprietorship, which is the simplest form. Then, we have a partnership, a limited liability company, and a corporation.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I see. What do you suggest?<p class=message>Well, that depends on the specifics of your business. We can discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each option before making a decision.<p class="message sent">Sounds reasonable. By the way, have you heard any good lawyer jokes lately?<p class=message>Ha! I have. What do you call a lawyer who doesn't know the law? A judge!<p class="message sent">That's a good one. How about this: why don't sharks attack lawyers? Professional courtesy!<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious! I may have to use that one myself.<p class="message sent">Glad I could brighten your day a bit. So, back to business, what are the fees for your services?<p class=message>We charge hourly rates, but we can discuss a package deal based on your needs and budget.<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds fair. Thanks for your help, I feel much more informed now.<p class=message>Of course, happy to help. Let's schedule a follow-up meeting to continue our discussion and take the next steps.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d5818e00-a331-49df-bbf1-e50be27f10f8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
