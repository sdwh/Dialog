Thank you for meeting with me today. I'm excited to discuss our new publishing plan.<p class="message sent">Hi, A. It's great to see you too. Yes, I'm looking forward to hearing your ideas.<p class=message>I'm thinking of writing a book about a young girl who becomes a superhero. It's going to be an adventure story with lots of action and humor.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. What age range are you targeting?<p class=message>I'd say it's suitable for middle-grade readers, around 8 to 12 years old.<p class="message sent">I see. Have you decided on a title yet?<p class=message>Yes, I'm thinking of "The Adventures of Sparky Girl."<p class="message sent">Okay, that's catchy. Do you have any particular illustrator in mind?<p class=message>Actually, I was hoping you could recommend someone.<p class="message sent">Of course, I work with some great illustrators. Let me send you a few portfolios to look through.<p class=message>That would be fantastic, thanks. What about the release date?<p class="message sent">It depends on your writing schedule, but I'm thinking we can aim for next summer.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Any thoughts on the book cover design?<p class="message sent">I think we should have something eye-catching that captures the theme of the story. Maybe have Sparky Girl in her superhero suit on the front cover.<p class=message>Great idea, I love it. And what about promotions and marketing?<p class="message sent">We can utilize social media, book fairs, and bookstore signings. We'll work on a plan together closer to the release date.<p class=message>Perfect. I'm feeling really excited about this project.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. It's going to be a great addition to our publishing company.<p class=message>Thank you, B. I appreciate your input and look forward to working together on this project.<p class="message sent">Same here, A. Let's get started.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5d04afa7-35dd-4948-86c7-548de663f2dd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
