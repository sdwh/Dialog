It's great to see you again. Ready to play some poker?<p class="message sent message-content">Hey A! Absolutely. I'm feeling lucky today, what about you?<p class="message received message-content">Same here! Let's shuffle the deck and deal the cards.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds good to me. You know, I haven't played poker in a while. What's the highest hand ranking again?<p class="message received message-content">It's a royal flush, B. Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten of the same suit.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh right, thanks for the reminder. I hope I get that hand!<p class="message received message-content">Haha, good luck with that. Don't forget, we're just playing for fun.<p class="message sent message-content">I know, but a little friendly competition never hurt anyone.<p class="message received message-content">Agreed. So, how's your day been so far?<p class="message sent message-content">It's been busy, but good. I managed to finish a task that's been on my to-do list for ages. How about you?<p class="message received message-content">Not bad either. I finally caught up on some reading that I've been putting off.<p class="message sent message-content">Nice! What kind of books do you like to read?<p class="message received message-content">I'm into mystery and crime novels. How about you?<p class="message sent message-content">I prefer fantasy and sci-fi. But I'll check out some mystery novels if you recommend any.<p class="message received message-content">Sure, I'll give you some titles. Now, let's get back to the game. It's your turn to raise or fold.<p class="message sent message-content">Thanks for reminding me. I'll raise this time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=090231b1-ae97-4286-b2ef-81e9ba28eb58.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
