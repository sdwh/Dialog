How about the front-end?<p class=message>It's coming along nicely, but I'm having some trouble with the layout. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Sure, have you considered using a grid system to help with the layout?<p class=message>That's a great idea, I'll look into it. How about the database design, any updates on that?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've made some changes to improve the efficiency and scalability of the database. Have you connected the front-end to the back-end yet?<p class=message>Yes, I've implemented some API calls to get and post data. Have you tested the API endpoints?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've tested them with some sample data and everything seems to be working fine. Do you have any new features you want to add?<p class=message>Actually, I was thinking of adding a chat feature. Do you think that's feasible?<p class="message sent">Definitely, we can use web sockets to create a real-time chat feature. I can start working on that.<p class=message>Great, thanks for your help. How about we take a quick break and grab some coffee?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, let's go. By the way, have you tried that new caf√© on 5th street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">It's amazing, their coffee is top-notch. You have to try it.<p class=message>I'll definitely check it out. So, any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Not really, just planning to catch up on some Netflix shows. How about you?<p class=message>I'm thinking of going hiking, there's a great trail I've been wanting to try.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of fun, enjoy your hike.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7eb99095-3f6c-471e-8879-9d6fff9bb2da.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
