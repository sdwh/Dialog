Can you give me more information about it?<p class=message>Of course! Can you tell me what country you have in mind?<p class="message sent">I'm thinking about Japan. I've always been fascinated with the culture and language.<p class=message>Japan is a great choice! We have several partner universities there. Have you researched which ones interest you?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've narrowed it down to two universities. One in Tokyo and one in Kyoto.<p class=message>Those are both excellent choices. The university in Tokyo has a strong program in business, and the one in Kyoto has a great program in art and literature.<p class="message sent">That's exactly what I'm looking for! But what about the language barrier? I'm not that fluent in Japanese.<p class=message>That's alright! Both universities offer language classes for international students. It's a great way to learn and immerse yourself in the language and culture.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! How long can I study there for?<p class=message>You can choose to study for a semester or a full academic year. It's up to you!<p class="message sent">I think I'll choose a full academic year. Thank you for all the information!<p class=message>You're welcome. Don't forget to look into scholarship opportunities and visa requirements. Let us know if you need any help with that!<p class="message sent">Will do. Thank you so much for your help!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=40f8ba3c-32d4-4263-916f-188176db7ee4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
