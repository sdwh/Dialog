I'm a huge fan of Japanese food. What kind of dishes do you have on your menu?<p class="message sent">Hi! Our restaurant specializes in Japanese cuisine, so we have a lot of delicious options available. We offer sushi, sashimi, donburi, tempura, and ramen.<p class=message>Wow, that all sounds great! I especially love sushi and sashimi. Can you tell me more about them?<p class="message sent">Sure, sushi is made with vinegared rice and usually topped with raw fish or seafood. Sashimi is also raw fish or seafood, but it's served without rice. Both are very popular dishes in Japan.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. How about the donburi?<p class="message sent">Donburi is a dish that consists of a bowl of rice topped with various ingredients such as meat, seafood, and vegetables. It's a hearty and filling meal!<p class=message>Yum, I'll have to try that sometime. And what about tempura?<p class="message sent">Tempura is a dish that consists of battered and deep-fried seafood or vegetables. It's a crispy and savory dish that's perfect as an appetizer or side dish.<p class=message>Oh, I love tempura! And finally, what can you tell me about ramen?<p class="message sent">Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup dish that's usually made with meat or fish broth and topped with various ingredients such as sliced pork, bamboo shoots, and seaweed. It's a very popular comfort food in Japan.<p class=message>That sounds absolutely amazing. I think I'm going to have a tough time choosing what to order!<p class="message sent">Everything on our menu is delicious, so you can't go wrong! Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences we should be aware of?<p class=message>No, I'm good to go! I'm so excited to try everything. Thank you for telling me about these dishes.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! We're excited to have you try them.
