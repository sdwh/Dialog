I'm really excited about opening our new fast food joint. We'll definitely need to make sure we have chicken burgers on the menu.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Chicken burgers are always a crowd-pleaser. But what kind of toppings should we put on them?<p class=message>Hmm, I was thinking maybe bacon, avocado, and spicy mayo?<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. We could also add some jalapenos for an extra kick.<p class=message>Good idea! What about sides? Fries, obviously. But we should also have something healthier, like a side salad.<p class="message sent">I agree. And for the adventurous eaters, we could have sweet potato fries or onion rings as a premium side.<p class=message>Yes, let's definitely offer premium options. It's all about giving our customers choices.<p class="message sent">Speaking of choices, what about the chicken patty itself? Should we go for grilled or fried?<p class=message>I think it might be good to offer both, since some people might want the healthier option but others might want the indulgent, crispy texture of a fried patty.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. And what about the bun? Should we stick with a classic brioche or mix it up with something like a pretzel bun?<p class=message>Let's do both as well! Classic and pretzel. That way people can choose what they're in the mood for.<p class="message sent">Excellent plan. I'm really excited about this menu. It's going to be awesome.<p class=message>Me too! I can't wait to see how it all comes together. We're going to have the best chicken burgers in town!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3d4dd06a-90bb-41d3-8039-793f24a46f14.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
