How are you doing today, B?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! I'm doing great. Ready to make some delicious Chinese breakfast for our customers?<p class=message>Absolutely! Let's start with the classic Chinese savory pancakes, shall we?<p class="message sent">Sounds good. I'll make some fresh, hot soy milk to go with it. Do you want me to add some black sesame or almond flavoring?<p class=message>Oh, definitely! That will make the soy milk even more delicious. Meanwhile, I'll start kneading the dough for the pancakes.<p class="message sent">Great. How long have you been making Chinese pancakes, A?<p class=message>Oh, for as long as I can remember. I learned from my grandmother when I was little.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. And your pancakes are always so crispy and yummy!<p class=message>Thank you, B! It's all about the technique.<p class="message sent">Speaking of technique, can you teach me how to make those fancy pancake folds?<p class=message>Of course! It's all about the wrist motion. Let me show you.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's so cool! I'll keep practicing.<p class=message>Don't worry, you'll get it soon enough. Did you hear about the new Chinese restaurant that just opened in town?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did. Have you tried it yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I heard the food is amazing. We should go there for dinner sometime.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great plan. And we can take notes on their dishes and improve our own menu, right?<p class=message>Absolutely! There's always room for inspiration and improvement. But first, let's focus on making these pancakes and soy milk for our customers.<p class="message sent">Yes, chef! Let's do this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5d68ebae-39d6-4347-9f20-4b3eb1aa1d3a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
