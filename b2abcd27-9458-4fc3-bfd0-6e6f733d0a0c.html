As a noodle master, what's your secret to making the best noodles?<p class="message sent">Oh hey! As a milk tea maker, I gotta say it's all about the proper ratio of water to flour and constant kneading to activate the gluten.<p class=message>Interesting! And what's your secret to making the perfect milk tea?<p class="message sent">It's all about the tea leaves and the time you steep it for. And of course, the right amount of milk and sugar to balance out the flavor.<p class=message>Yeah, I can see the process is just as important as the recipe. Speaking of recipes, have you ever come up with a unique noodle or milk tea flavor?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was inspired by my grandma's recipe and started adding a touch of lavender to my classic milk tea. It gives it a subtle floral hint that people seem to love.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing! And for noodles, I once added truffle oil to my tomato sauce and it was a game-changer.<p class="message sent">That sounds heavenly! We should collaborate and make a truffle infused milk tea and tomato sauce noodle dish.<p class=message>That's brilliant! People would definitely come from all over to try it. Speaking of which, have you tried any local Shanghai delicacies that we can learn from?<p class="message sent">I tried stinky tofu for the first time yesterday and for me, it's almost an acquired taste. How about you?<p class=message>I absolutely loved xiaolongbao, those tiny dumplings with soup inside. And you know it's real when the juice squirts out and scalds your tongue!<p class="message sent">Oh, I love those too! Alright, back to work. Let's serve some delicious noodles and milk teas to these hungry customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b2a3a6de-3511-410e-8c3c-8e38ce9369e3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
