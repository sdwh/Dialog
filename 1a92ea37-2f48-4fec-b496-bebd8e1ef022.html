How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, thank you! I was wondering if you had any rooms available for the next two nights with a view of the ocean.<p class=message>Sure thing! We do have a few rooms left with ocean views. Would you like me to show you some options?<p class="message sent">That would be great! Also, do you have any recommendations for things to do in the area?<p class=message>Of course! You can try the water sports activities on the beach, explore the nearby hiking trails, or visit some of the local tourist attractions.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. Can you help me book some of those activities?<p class=message>Absolutely, I can arrange that for you. Would you prefer to book them in advance or when you arrive?<p class="message sent">I think I'll book them when I arrive, so I can plan my schedule accordingly.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. We also have a restaurant in the hotel with amazing seafood, if you're interested.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love seafood! I'll definitely check it out.<p class=message>Great! Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class="message sent">No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much for your help!<p class=message>You're welcome! Please let me know if you need anything during your stay. Enjoy your time by the beach!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1a89dd6f-7cf4-42a3-8585-2c976753f04b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
