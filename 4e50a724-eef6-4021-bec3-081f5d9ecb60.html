How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Oh, good morning, dear. I'm feeling a bit tired, but I'm glad to see you.<p class=message>I can help you with your breakfast if you like. Do you have any preferences?<p class="message sent">Well, I have a sweet tooth, so some pancakes or waffles would be lovely.<p class=message>Absolutely. Would you like some fruit on top as well?<p class="message sent">Yes, please, some strawberries would be great.<p class=message>Coming right up. I heard you used to be a performer when you were younger. What did you do?<p class="message sent">Oh, I was a tap dancer. I loved the rhythm and energy of it!<p class=message>That's amazing! Have you taught anyone else here to dance?<p class="message sent">Oh, no, not really. But I did show one of the staff members a few steps once.<p class=message>Maybe we should organize a dance lesson for everyone here. I'm sure they'd love to learn from you.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a wonderful idea! Thank you, dear. You're always full of great suggestions.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, B. I'm always here to help make your day a little brighter.<p class="message sent">Well, you certainly do. And I appreciate it more than you know.<p class=message>It's so lovely to see you smile. Is there anything else I can help you with today?<p class="message sent">No, dear, you've done more than enough. I'm quite content now.<p class=message>Alright then, B. I'll check on you later to see if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Thank you, goodbye for now.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e502c2d-cae7-4d93-99d9-f1150b7e03f2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
