Could you take me to the theatre on the corner of Main Street and Broadway, please?<p class=message>Sure thing, but before we hit the road, could I remind you to fasten your seatbelt? It's for your safety.<p class="message sent">Oh, of course. Thanks for reminding me.<p class=message>No problem. By the way, as we enter the downtown area, always keep an eye out for pedestrians crossing the street. You don't want to accidentally run over someone.<p class="message sent">Good to know. Another question, what's the speed limit in this area?<p class=message>The speed limit is typically 30 miles per hour, but sometimes it can be lower especially in school zones or construction sites.<p class="message sent">Understood. And what about turning left?<p class=message>When turning left, always make sure to yield to any oncoming traffic or pedestrians, and avoid blocking the intersection.<p class="message sent">Thanks for explaining everything. You know a lot about traffic rules!<p class=message>Well, I've been driving in this city for over 20 years now. Safety always comes first. Speaking of which, we're about to approach a traffic light. Remember to stop at a red light and proceed only when it turns green.<p class="message sent">Got it. I'll remember to be a responsible passenger.<p class=message>That's the spirit! And don't hesitate to ask me any questions along the way. I'm happy to help.<p class="message sent">Thanks, driver. You're very helpful.<p class=message>Just doing my job! We're almost there, by the way. Enjoy the show at the theatre!<p class="message sent">Thanks, I will. Have a good day, driver.<p class=message>You too. Take care and stay safe!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=22abaa47-9003-477a-ba38-837f50b9a123.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
