He's pretty talented!<p class="message sent">Oh really? Well that's great news, especially for us security experts. We need all the help we can get in protecting sensitive financial data.<p class=message>Yeah, he's been chatting me up about all sorts of new security measures he wants to implement. He seems really passionate about it.<p class="message sent">That's exactly what we need! A passionate engineer who takes security seriously. It's not enough to just lock everything up behind a firewall anymore.<p class=message>Totally agree. Especially with all the recent news about data breaches and hacking attempts. It's enough to make a person paranoid!<p class="message sent">Haha, no need to be paranoid. Just need to be extra cautious and vigilant. And with this new backend engineer, I'm feeling pretty good about our ability to protect our clients' financial transactions.<p class=message>Yeah, I think we're in good hands. Plus, we have you here to handle all the cybersecurity stuff.<p class="message sent">*laughs* That's right. The knight in shining armor, here to save the day!<p class=message>But seriously, thanks for all your hard work. We couldn't do it without you.<p class="message sent">*smiles* Anytime, A. It's all for the sake of keeping our financial data safe and secure!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2b913c98-81fc-4b63-8d7d-b733dc126cfb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
