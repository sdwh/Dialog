What would you like to drink, sir?<p class=message>Hmm, what do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Well, we have a variety of beverages, both hot and cold. Do you prefer something refreshing or something warming?<p class=message>It's a bit chilly in here, so maybe something to warm me up?<p class="message sent">How about some hot chocolate or a latte?<p class=message>Ooo, I do love a good hot chocolate. Can I add some marshmallows on top?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, sir! Would you like it in a to-go cup or can I bring it to your seat?<p class=message>I think I'll stay in the galley with you if you don't mind.<p class="message sent">Not at all, sir. It's always fun having some company during the flight.<p class=message>Great! So, do you always work on this plane or do you get to travel to different places?<p class="message sent">I'm actually based in London, but our routes do change from time to time. Last week, I was in Tokyo and next week, I'll be headed to New York.<p class=message>Wow, you must have a lot of stories to tell!<p class="message sent">You could say that. It's definitely a different lifestyle but I do enjoy it.<p class=message>That's really cool. Maybe one day, I'll be able to travel like you do.<p class="message sent">You never know! Anything is possible. Here's your hot chocolate with marshmallows, sir. Enjoy!<p class=message>Thank you so much! This is delicious.<p class="message sent">My pleasure.
