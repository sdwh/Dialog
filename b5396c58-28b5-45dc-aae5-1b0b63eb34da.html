Could you tell me how to use the laundry service in your hotel?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Sure thing. Our laundry service is available for guests 24/7. You can find a laundry bag in your room's closet.<p class=message>Okay, and how much does it cost?<p class="message sent">We have a price list in the laundry bag, but just so you know, the pricing depends on the type of clothing and how much you want to wash. But don't worry, it's reasonably priced.<p class=message>That sounds great. What is the usual turnaround time for laundry?<p class="message sent">Our laundry service turnaround time is usually about 24 hours, but if you need it sooner, we can try to accommodate your request.<p class=message>And how do I pay for the service?<p class="message sent">We can just charge it to your room's bill if you're staying with us, or we can process the payment directly if you're not. We accept most major credit cards.<p class=message>Awesome, thanks for explaining all of that. Are there any special instructions I need to know about?<p class="message sent">Yes, please make sure to fill out the laundry slip completely, including any special instructions, and place it in the bag with your clothes. If you have any delicate or expensive clothing, please let us know so we can take extra care.<p class=message>Got it. I'll fill out the slip and leave the bag outside my door for pickup. Do I need to call reception to request pickup?<p class="message sent">No, you don't need to call. Just leave the bag outside your door by 9 a.m. and we'll pick it up. If you miss this time, just give us a call and we'll arrange pickup for later.<p class=message>Sounds easy enough. Thanks for helping me with this.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Let us know if you have any other questions or requests during your stay.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b5372f7f-3201-4248-b3f0-fae86ef01e05.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
