Thanks for meeting me here at Starbucks. How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thanks for asking. How about you, A?<p class=message>Can't complain. So, I wanted to talk to you about improving our website's search function. I noticed it's been a little clunky lately.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we definitely need to work on that. What ideas do you have?<p class=message>Well, for starters, I was thinking we could incorporate some sort of autocomplete function. That way, users can find what they're looking for faster.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see what you mean. We could also implement filters to narrow down search results.<p class=message>Great idea! And what about optimizing for mobile devices?<p class="message sent">That's a must. Our website should be responsive and easy to navigate on any device.<p class=message>Speaking of navigation, how about we add a breadcrumb trail to show users where they are in the website hierarchy?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a good idea. And we should ensure that users can easily refine the search results.<p class=message>Definitely. And perhaps we could also add some more user-friendly language to our search bar to make it more approachable.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. And let's make sure to test the new search function before we launch it to ensure it's working smoothly.<p class=message>Agreed. This is going to be great for our users. Thanks for brainstorming with me, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always good to work together to improve our website's functionality.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f34e1eb9-efb2-46fb-aea0-6e262a2b1088.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
