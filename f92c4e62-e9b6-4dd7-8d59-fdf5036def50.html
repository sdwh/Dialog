What is it all about?<p class=message>Well, it’s called ISO 27001 and it’s all about managing security risks to protect sensitive information.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. How does it work?<p class=message>Basically, businesses can implement a framework for managing and protecting their information with ISO 27001.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I wonder if it’s worth the investment.<p class=message>It definitely can be. Businesses that implement ISO 27001 can increase their credibility and trust with customers.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Do you know if it’s difficult to implement?<p class=message>It can be a bit tricky, but there are plenty of resources available to guide you through the process.<p class="message sent">Okay, that’s good to know. What types of risks does it cover?<p class=message>It covers a variety of risks, such as unauthorized access, hacking, and physical theft of information.<p class="message sent">I see. It definitely sounds like it could be worth considering.<p class=message>Definitely. Plus, it’s always better to be proactive when it comes to protecting sensitive information.<p class="message sent">That’s very true. Do you know of any companies that have already implemented ISO 27001?<p class=message>Yes, there are quite a few companies that have already implemented it, such as Google and Microsoft.<p class="message sent">Wow, that’s impressive. I think I’ll have to do some more research on this.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Let me know if you have any questions.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks for the heads up on this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f91a94ea-6b21-408b-8e9a-cfe7765a8045.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
