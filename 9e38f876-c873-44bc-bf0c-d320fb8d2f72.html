How are you today?<p class="message sent">Not too shabby, just another day behind the wheel. How about you?<p class=message>I'm excited! It's my first time going to the Gold Coast. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, it's gorgeous. Great weather, amazing views, and lots of fun things to do. What's your plan for your trip?<p class=message>I'm going to hit up the beach, of course, and try some surfing. Then maybe check out Movie World or Wet'n'Wild. What would you recommend?<p class="message sent">If you're looking for adventure, I suggest heading to the Tamborine Rainforest. It's a beautiful hike and there's a chance to see some wildlife. And if you're into food, definitely try the seafood. It's the freshest around.<p class=message>Sounds great! I'm so excited. Do you have any favorite songs you like to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">As a matter of fact, I do. I'm a classic rock guy. You can never go wrong with Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd. How about you?<p class=message>I'm more into pop music, like Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran. But I could definitely jam out to some rock too.<p class="message sent">It's all good. Music is music. Speaking of which, do you play any instruments?<p class=message>I dabble on the guitar, but I'm not that great. What about you?<p class="message sent">I played the drums back in high school, but haven't had much time for it lately. One day I'll get back into it. Well, here we are at your destination. Have a great trip!<p class=message>Thank you so much! It was great chatting with you. And who knows, maybe we'll run into each other on the Gold Coast someday.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e2d32da-b891-4ade-9180-f9c0c4a41a68.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
