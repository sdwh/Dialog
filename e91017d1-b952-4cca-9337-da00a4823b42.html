How's it going with the kimchi production today?<p class="message sent">Not bad, we are in the middle of fermenting our special recipe. How about you?<p class=message>I am doing some quality testing on the finished products, making sure they meet our standards.<p class="message sent">That's great. Can I show you something interesting? Look at this big jar of kimchi, the bubbles are rising and it looks like it's alive!<p class=message>Wow, that's fascinating. I've heard that bubbles are a good sign of fermentation, so your kimchi is in good shape.<p class="message sent">Yes, it means that the lactic acid bacteria are working hard to make our kimchi tangy and delicious.<p class=message>Speaking of delicious, can I try some of your kimchi? I'm a huge fan of Korean food.<p class="message sent">Of course, let me get you a freshly made batch. Here you go, it's not too spicy, but has a nice garlicky flavor.<p class=message>Mmm, this is definitely the real deal. I can taste the crispiness of the cabbage and the perfect balance of seasoning.<p class="message sent">Thank you, we take great pride in our kimchi. It's not just a food, it's a culture.<p class=message>I totally agree. Kimchi has so many health benefits too, like probiotics and vitamin C.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's why we are committed to using fresh and natural ingredients, and taking care of every step in the production process.<p class=message>Well, I have to say, you are doing an excellent job. It was a pleasure to meet you and witness the making of kimchi.<p class="message sent">Thank you for your kind words, and your help with the quality control. Don't forget to come back and taste our other varieties of kimchi.<p class=message>I won't, I look forward to it. Have a great day and happy fermenting!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e90fa314-02a3-4a21-9ea4-997d6b722d6b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
