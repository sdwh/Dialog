I'm always ready to crush some competition.<p class=message>(laughs) We'll see about that. Shall we start a new game or continue from where we left off last time?<p class="message sent">Let's start a new one. And this time, I won't hold back.<p class=message>(smirks) You say that every time. But okay, bring it on!<p class="message sent">(selects his character) I'm going with Yoshi this time. Who are you playing as?<p class=message>I'm going with Princess Peach. She's always been my favorite.<p class="message sent">(nods) Good choice. So, what's the game plan? Mini-games or co-op mode?<p class=message>Let's start with the mini-games. They always get me hyped up.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Same here. Alright, let the games begin!<p class=message>(after a few rounds of mini-games) You're pretty good at this! I might have underestimated you.<p class="message sent">(grinning) Told you not to hold back. But, the real challenge is yet to come.<p class=message>(laughs) Oh, the confidence! Okay, let's move on to the main event.<p class="message sent">(determined) I'm ready. Let's see who emerges victorious.<p class=message>(playing the game) Wait, wait, wait... How did you just do that? That was some next-level strategy.<p class="message sent">(laughing) Can't reveal all my secrets, can I? It's all about timing and precision.<p class=message>(nodding) I see. Well, don't get too comfortable yet. I'm not giving up without a fight.<p class="message sent">(smiling) That's the spirit. Let's finish this game and then switch to something else.<p class=message>(grinning) Sounds like a plan. But you better watch out, I might surprise you.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Bring it on! It's always a pleasure playing with you, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3b3c415a-e859-464d-a40b-67b67e1b0220.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
