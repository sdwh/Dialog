What brings you to the airport today?<p class="message sent">Hey, I work in the travel industry and I'm here to discuss sales strategies for our new travel products.<p class=message>Sounds great! We're happy to hear what you have in mind.<p class="message sent">Well, we're considering offering package deals with flights, hotels, and tours all included. What do you think?<p class=message>Hmm, that could definitely appeal to customers looking for convenience. But what about those who prefer to plan their own itinerary?<p class="message sent">Ah, good point. Maybe we can also offer more customizable options for those customers.<p class=message>That's a good idea. What else do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">We could also partner with local businesses and attractions to offer exclusive discounts to our customers.<p class=message>Yes! That could really set you apart from other travel companies. Have you done something like that before?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. It's been successful in the past.<p class=message>Great! Well, as a ticket agent here, I see a lot of travelers come through. What destinations are you currently promoting?<p class="message sent">We're focusing on tropical destinations such as Hawaii, the Caribbean, and Mexico.<p class=message>Nice, those are always popular choices. How about some lesser-known destinations?<p class="message sent">That's a good point. We could highlight some hidden gems like Costa Rica, Belize, or even Iceland.<p class=message>Sounds like a good mix. Do you have any promotions or special deals coming up?<p class="message sent">Yes, we're offering a discounted rate on our Mexico packages for the next month.<p class=message>I'm already feeling the urge to pack my bags and head to Mexico! Thanks for sharing your ideas with us.<p class="message sent">Thank you for your feedback! It's always great to hear from people on the front lines of travel sales.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d8660144-ace2-4631-9d66-7e917ad1798c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
