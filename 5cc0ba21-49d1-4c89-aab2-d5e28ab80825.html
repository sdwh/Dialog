Let's start the stand-up meeting. B, what did you work on yesterday?<p class="message sent">Good morning. Yesterday, I fixed a bug related to the login feature. It was a silly mistake, but I finally figured it out.<p class=message>That's great news, B. Anything else you worked on?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I also started working on a new feature for the app. It's going to make it easier for users to search for specific products.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. Do you need any help with that?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I'll definitely let you know if I do. How about you, A? What did you work on yesterday?<p class=message>I spent most of my day in meetings, but I did manage to review some code and give feedback to the team. Oh, and I also took a break to play some ping pong in the office.<p class="message sent">Ha ha, that's awesome. Did you win?<p class=message>Of course, I'm the office ping pong champion. But maybe I'll have some competition soon if you keep practicing.<p class="message sent">Challenge accepted! Alright, is there anything else we need to cover in today's meeting?<p class=message>No, that's it for now. Keep up the good work, everyone, and let's meet again tomorrow to discuss our progress.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5cc0405b-0051-4aed-a1be-1aceb0b3b131.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
