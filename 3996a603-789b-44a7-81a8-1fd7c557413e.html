The database schema is designed, and we are focusing on ensuring the integration of the web API with the back-end.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Have you thought about how we can present the data in a visually appealing way on the front-end?<p class="message sent">Yes, I was thinking of using some interactive graphing tools to display the data. Maybe we can add some animated whale sightings as well.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds like a fun addition. Speaking of whales, have you ever gone whale watching before?<p class="message sent">I haven't, but it's on my bucket list. How about you?<p class=message>I have! It was amazing to see those gentle giants up close. Speaking of marine animals, we also need to figure out how to incorporate data on endangered species into our website.<p class="message sent">Yes, we definitely should. Maybe we can add a feature that highlights different endangered species and explains why they are important to protect.<p class=message>That's a good idea. We should also include links to organizations that focus on conserving marine life.<p class="message sent">Completely agree! It's always good to promote environmental awareness. This project is so exciting; I can't wait to show our finished product!<p class=message>Yes, it is. But we still have a lot of work to do. We need to ensure that the website is responsive and user-friendly on different devices.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I will work on making sure that the website is compatible with mobile devices as well.<p class=message>Sounds good. Let's make sure to keep each other updated on any progress or new ideas we have.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Collaboration is key to a successful project.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=398c2aa5-2976-48c5-aebf-e06447618b97.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
