This is my first time at the Opera House.<p class=message>That's great to hear, it's a stunning venue. What kind of music are you into?<p class="message sent">I love classical music, particularly Beethoven and Mozart.<p class=message>Oh, you're in for a treat tonight then. We're performing a selection of Mozart's greatest symphonies.<p class="message sent">Wonderful, I can't wait to hear it. Are you excited to be playing tonight?<p class=message>Of course, playing on this stage is a dream come true. The acoustics here are amazing.<p class="message sent">I've heard that the roof of the Opera House is designed to look like sails. It's such a unique and interesting structure.<p class=message>Yes, it's one of the most recognizable buildings in the world. It's always a surreal feeling being up on stage looking out at it.<p class="message sent">Do you have any pre-concert rituals or routines that you follow?<p class=message>I like to take a few deep breaths and run through the pieces in my head. And a cup of tea always calms my nerves.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great way to mentally prepare. What about after the concert, how do you unwind?<p class=message>After a performance, I like to spend some time with my fellow musicians, grab a drink and celebrate the night's success.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a fun way to end the evening. Thank you for talking with me, and break a leg!<p class=message>Thank you, it was great chatting with you. Enjoy the show!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=36a18502-e3ac-4374-8fa3-a2054dcb101d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
