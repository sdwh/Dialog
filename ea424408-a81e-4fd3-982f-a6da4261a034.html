What do you think could be causing the queries to execute inefficiently?<p class="message sent">Well, I've noticed that some of the queries have a lot of joins and subqueries, which can slow things down. Also, the indexing scheme could use some tuning.<p class=message>Ah, I see. That makes sense. Do you have any recommendations for improving the indexing?<p class="message sent">Yes, I think we could use more selective indexing and remove redundant indexes. Also, we could try using filtered indexes to speed up certain queries.<p class=message>Good ideas. I remember reading about those techniques in some of the SQL Server documentation.<p class="message sent">Yes, they're pretty widely used in the industry. It's also important to monitor the query performance regularly to catch any potential issues early on.<p class=message>Absolutely. We don't want to wait until the system is brought to a halt before addressing any performance issues.<p class="message sent">Right. And if we do hit a bottleneck, we can use SQL Server's query tuning capabilities to troubleshoot the root cause.<p class=message>That's definitely reassuring to know. Thanks for sharing your expertise on this, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to help. It's exciting to work on such a high-traffic e-commerce system, even with the occasional performance hiccup.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ea3d7348-6f20-4882-b515-0238224b4ab2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
