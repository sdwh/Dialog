It's all about information security management system, right?<p class=message>That's right. I've been reading up on it and it seems pretty interesting.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's becoming more and more important with all the cyber attacks going on these days.<p class=message>Yeah, and it's not just for big corporations. Small companies are also vulnerable to cyber attacks.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, have you been following the guidelines for compliance?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. It's not an easy feat, but it's necessary for the safety of our information.<p class="message sent">I could imagine. What kind of security measures have you implemented in your company?<p class=message>We've implemented access control, regular security awareness training, and conducted regular risk assessments.<p class="message sent">Sounds thorough. Have you considered getting certified for compliance?<p class=message>Actually, I have. I think it would give our clients more confidence in us handling their sensitive information.<p class="message sent">True. And it's also a good way to stand out from other companies.<p class=message>Definitely. Plus, it shows that we take information security seriously.<p class="message sent">For sure. I think I'm going to start looking more into ISO 27001 Compliance myself.<p class=message>Great idea. It's always good to stay informed about these things.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Thanks for explaining it to me, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to talk about information security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e4a2e1af-b11e-4291-9318-37df76960103.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
