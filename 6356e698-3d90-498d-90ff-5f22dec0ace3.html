How's it going?<p class="message sent">Good to see you, A. I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too. So, I wanted to talk to you about our book publishing plan.<p class="message sent">Sure, what's on your mind?<p class=message>Well, I've been working on this new novel that I'm really excited about, and I think it's ready for publication.<p class="message sent">That's great news! Can you tell me more about it?<p class=message>It's a funny romantic comedy set in a small town. I think it will appeal to a wide audience.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. Who do you think the target audience is?<p class=message>I think it will appeal to both men and women, young and old. It has a bit of everything.<p class="message sent">Okay, let me ask you some questions about the manuscript. First, how long is it?<p class=message>It's around 300 pages.<p class="message sent">That's a good length for a novel. Have you had any beta readers or feedback on it yet?<p class=message>Yes, I've had a few people read it and give me some feedback. I've incorporated their suggestions into the final draft.<p class="message sent">Excellent, that's always helpful. So, what's your timeline for publishing?<p class=message>I was thinking we could aim to publish in the fall, maybe September.<p class="message sent">That sounds reasonable. We'll need to start working on the editing and cover design soon, though.<p class=message>Right, I'm happy to collaborate with you on that. By the way, how's your new puppy doing?<p class="message sent">He's great, thanks for asking. He's keeping me busy, that's for sure.<p class=message>I bet he is! I'm more of a cat person myself.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know you are. That's okay, we can't all be perfect.<p class=message>Ha, thanks for the laugh. It's good to catch up with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. Let's get to work on this book so we can get it out to the world.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=634689fb-7ca3-476c-a18f-f2869fb02505.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
