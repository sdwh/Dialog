How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey there, A. I'm doing fine, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks. So, I'm really excited about designing this social media app together. What do you think we should focus on?<p class="message sent">Well, I think we need to make sure the app is user-friendly and has a smooth user interface. What do you think?<p class=message>Absolutely, that's a great starting point. We also need to make sure it's visually appealing and has some unique features that set it apart from other social media apps.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Have you thought about color schemes and typography yet?<p class=message>Yes, I have a couple of ideas in mind. I'm thinking vibrant and eye-catching colors with bold typography to make a statement.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. How about the navigation of the app? We need to ensure it's simple and easy to navigate through the different features.<p class=message>Yes, we can incorporate some drop-down menus and icons to make it user-friendly. We can also add a tutorial section for first-time users.<p class="message sent">Good idea. What about the overall theme? Should we go for minimalist, trendy, or maybe something more playful?<p class=message>Well, social media is all about staying connected, having fun, and sharing. So let's go for something more playful and lively. Maybe we can add some emoticons and themes for users to customize their profiles.<p class="message sent">Sounds great. We can also add fun features like quizzes and games to engage the users.<p class=message>Perfect, users love those. We can also add a chat feature where users can connect with each other in real-time.<p class="message sent">Great idea! That feature will give the app a personal touch that users appreciate. Overall, I think our app will be a huge success with all the unique features we are planning to add.<p class=message>I completely agree. This is going to be amazing!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c4361e94-d6b1-42fe-859d-da80a610592c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
