I think I might have fractured my arm. It's really painful and I can't move it.<p class="message sent">Hi, there. Let me take a look. Hmm, it definitely looks like you have a fracture. We'll need to do an X-ray to confirm.<p class=message>That doesn't sound too bad. What are my treatment options?<p class="message sent">Well, depending on the severity, we might need to put a cast on your arm to immobilize it so that it can heal properly. You could also undergo surgery if the fracture is more severe.<p class=message>Yikes, I hope it doesn't come to that. How long will I have to wear a cast?<p class="message sent">It varies, but typically it takes about 6-8 weeks for a bone to heal. During that time, you'll need to avoid putting any pressure on your arm.<p class=message>Wow, that's kind of a long time. How will I manage everyday tasks with just one arm?<p class="message sent">It'll be a bit more challenging, but you can still do most things. We'll give you some basic exercises to do to help maintain strength and mobility in your hand as well.<p class=message>Okay, that's reassuring. Thanks for your help, doc.<p class="message sent">No problem. Just make sure to follow all the instructions for the cast and the exercises, and you'll be back to normal in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=98ff7580-ca23-44f9-b528-47d6fbbbe5fa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
