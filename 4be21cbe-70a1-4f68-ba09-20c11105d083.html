But there are a few things we need to address from a security standpoint.<p class=message>Oh no, what did you find?<p class="message sent">We have a potential SQL injection vulnerability in one of the pages, and some passwords were stored in plaintext.<p class=message>Yikes! We need to fix that ASAP!<p class="message sent">Yeah, I agree. But don't worry, I've already written up some suggested fixes for the code.<p class=message>Great work, B. You know, I'm beginning to think you enjoy finding these security issues.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You got me! It's like a game of hide-and-seek, and I'm determined to find all the hidden issues!<p class=message>Well, you're definitely good at it. I know we can always count on you to keep our systems secure.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. And speaking of security, did you hear about that hacker group that tried to steal a bunch of bitcoins?<p class=message>Yeah, I heard about it. They must have thought they hit the jackpot - but they forgot about the blockchain!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Exactly! It's like trying to rob a bank that has all its money transparently displayed in a glass vault.<p class=message>And you know what they say - crime doesn't pay...in bitcoins at least!<p class="message sent">(laughs) You got that right. But it's always good to stay vigilant and keep our eyes out for potential vulnerabilities.<p class=message>Agreed. Thanks for your hard work, B. Let's get started on fixing those issues.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4be1994b-147d-4212-ab60-9b6431d18fa8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
