What is it?<p class=message>It's basically a Thai dessert made with chewy rice, juicy mango slices, and a sweet coconut sauce.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! Is it easy to make?<p class=message>It's not too difficult, but it can be a bit time-consuming because you have to cook the rice and make the sauce from scratch.<p class="message sent">I see. Well, I'm definitely up for trying it. Do you have a good recipe?<p class=message>Yes, I do! I can send it to you if you want.<p class="message sent">That would be great, thanks! Have you ever had it at a restaurant or only made it at home?<p class=message>I've had it at a few Thai restaurants and it's always delicious, but I think making it at home is even better because you can adjust the sweetness and flavor to your liking.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I can't wait to try making it myself.<p class=message>You should! It's a fun and tasty dessert that's perfect for summer.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Maybe we can have a Mango Sticky Rice party sometime!<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can invite our friends and make different variations of the recipe.<p class="message sent">Yes! Some with more coconut sauce, others with extra mango... the possibilities are endless.<p class=message>I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!<p class="message sent">Me too. Let's plan it soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=990a219b-e29b-41c7-a78a-0d3b35cf6791.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
