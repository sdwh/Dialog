I’m your tour guide for today. My name is Alice. Before we start, do you have any questions?<p class="message sent">Yes, Alice. How long has the Opera House been open to the public?<p class=message>The Opera House has been open since 1973. It took 14 years to build and cost around $102 million AUD.<p class="message sent">Wow, that’s really interesting. What is the most popular show that has ever been performed here?<p class=message>I’d say that the most popular show would have to be ‘The Phantom of the Opera’. It’s an all-time classic and has been performed over 1,900 times at the Opera House.<p class="message sent">That’s amazing! How many people can the Sydney Opera House seat?<p class=message>The Opera House has five main performance venues with a total capacity of around 5,700 people. And the smallest venue can seat up to 400 people.<p class="message sent">That’s really impressive. What about the design of the building? Can you tell us more about it?<p class=message>Of course! The Opera House was designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon. The building's design is meant to look like a ship sailing on the water, or even a set of sails. It’s definitely a unique piece of architecture.<p class="message sent">That’s so cool! I’m excited to see the inside of the Opera House. Can we start with the tour now?<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's start with the Concert Hall, where you can see one of the largest organs in the world. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask me anytime during the tour.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Alice! This is going to be an unforgettable experience.<p class=message>Glad to hear it! Let's go and enjoy the wonders of the Sydney Opera House together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5c38eed3-a34c-438f-bd78-8407f1333e07.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
