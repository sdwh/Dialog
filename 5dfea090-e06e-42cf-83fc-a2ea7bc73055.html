It's great to meet you!<p class=message>Likewise. So, have you been climbing for long?<p class="message sent">Yeah, about five years now. It's my favourite hobby.<p class=message>That's amazing. I'm more of a landscape photographer, but I love capturing people doing what they love.<p class="message sent">Well, you've come to the right place. The Blue Mountains are an amazing spot for climbing.<p class=message>Absolutely. You must feel pretty accomplished when you reach the top of a climb?<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's an exhilarating feeling.<p class=message>I'm sure it is. So, are there any climbs you have your eye on today?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm hoping to tackle a climb called "The Perfect Storm". It's a challenging one.<p class=message>Sounds intense. I'll make sure to get some great shots of your ascent.<p class="message sent">I'll try to make it look easy for the camera.<p class=message>That's the spirit! Hey, have you ever considered doing some photography yourself?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've taken a few shots here and there while out on climbs.<p class=message>Well, maybe we can swap roles for a bit. I'll show you some tips and tricks, and you can show me some awesome climbs.<p class="message sent">Deal! Sounds like a fun day.<p class=message>Alright, let's get started. I can't wait to see you in action!<p class="message sent">Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5dfdcdc5-434a-43d3-9c4a-3c4f0d82c3e3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
