Have you tried debugging it using console.log?<p class="message sent">Yes, but it's still not clear where the problem is coming from.<p class=message>Sometimes the error message can be deceiving. Have you tried using a debugger?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I think I'll give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class=message>No problem, we're all in this together. How's your project coming along?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty well so far. Just trying to figure out if Node.js is the best option for this particular feature.<p class=message>Yeah, there are always trade-offs when choosing a technology stack. What other options are you considering?<p class="message sent">I'm thinking about using Ruby on Rails, but I'm not as proficient in that language as I am in JavaScript.<p class=message>Well, Node.js is definitely more popular these days, so it might be worth sticking with it.<p class="message sent">That's true. I'll keep working on it and see how it goes.<p class=message>Sounds good. By the way, have you seen the latest internet meme going around?<p class="message sent">No, what is it?<p class=message>It's a GIF of a cat trying to catch its tail. Hilarious!<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's great. I'll have to check it out later.<p class=message>Yeah, sometimes we all need a little break from coding to enjoy the lighter things in life.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Otherwise, we might go crazy staring at our screens all day!<p class=message>(laughs) Very true. Speaking of which, I think it's time for a coffee break. Want to join me?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Let's go refuel before getting back to work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e7e8af6d-849a-4771-b610-7111a3194829.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
