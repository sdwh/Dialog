You can buy a single ride ticket or a rechargeable card that you just tap as you enter and exit the station.<p class="message sent">That sounds convenient. How much is a single ride ticket?<p class=message>It's $2.75, but I recommend getting the rechargeable card so you don't have to worry about constantly buying tickets.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll definitely do that. How much is the card?<p class=message>The card costs $1, but you have to put a minimum of $5 on it to activate it.<p class="message sent">Got it! And how do I add more money onto the card once it runs out?<p class=message>You can add more money at the ticket vending machines located in the stations or by downloading the mobile app and adding money through there.<p class="message sent">Sweet, thanks for explaining all of this to me. How long will the subway take to get us to the concert?<p class=message>It should take about 30 minutes, but make sure to check the subway schedule just in case there are any delays.<p class="message sent">Good thinking, I'll do that. Do you take the subway often?<p class=message>Yeah, it's my go-to transportation method. It's cheaper and quicker than taking a taxi or driving in traffic.<p class="message sent">That's true. I've never taken the subway before, so I'm excited to try it out.<p class=message>You'll love it! Plus, we won't have to worry about finding parking near the venue.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Thanks again for helping me out with all of this. Let's go catch that train!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aa48f3c0-f4a1-43e7-9ff5-3de07d63a147.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
