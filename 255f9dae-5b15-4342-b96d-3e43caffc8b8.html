How's your day going?<p class="message sent">It's going great! I'm just finishing up this batch of Okinawan sweet potato milk tea. It's one of the most popular drinks here.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. How do you make it?<p class="message sent">Well, first we boil the sweet potato and mash it into a paste. Then we mix it with milk and add sugar to taste. Finally, we steep black tea in the mixture and strain it.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I can't wait to try it out!<p class="message sent">Yeah, I think our customers will love it. Hey, have you tried the local specialty, goya champuru?<p class=message>Umm, no. What's that?<p class="message sent">It's a stir-fry dish made with bitter melon, tofu, egg, and pork. It might sound odd, but it's really tasty.<p class=message>Hmm, I'm not sure about the bitter melon part. But I trust your taste buds. Let's give it a try.<p class="message sent">Great! We can also make some Okinawan soba noodles to go with it.<p class=message>Perfect. Our customers will be impressed with our new specialties.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, have we decided on a name for our new Okinawan menu?<p class=message>Not yet. How about "Okinawa Delights"?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that sounds a bit generic. How about "Oishii Okinawa" - "oishii" means delicious in Japanese.<p class=message>I like it! "Oishii Okinawa" it is then.<p class="message sent">Great! It's important to have a catchy name to attract customers.<p class=message>Absolutely. Speaking of which, we should also consider incorporating some of these drinks into our happy hour menu.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We can also offer specialty cocktails inspired by Okinawan flavors.<p class=message>Yes, and we can train our bartenders to make them. This is going to be a hit.<p class="message sent">I agree. I'm excited to see how our customers react.<p class=message>Thanks for showing me around and teaching me these new recipes, B. You're a great asset to our team.<p class="message sent">No problem. I'm happy to share my knowledge and passion for mixology and cuisine.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=255cd920-a739-4936-972f-2cec6a5aa174.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
