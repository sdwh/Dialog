Do you know the details?<p class=message>Well, not really. But I heard there are a few steps we need to take before we can go live.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. So what’s our first step then?<p class=message>We need to make sure that everything is properly configured in the system. We don’t want to have any unexpected issues after going live.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. That’d be a nightmare. What’s next?<p class=message>Next, we need to test the system thoroughly. We should have a team dedicated to this task.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And we also need to make sure that the system is user-friendly.<p class=message>Good point. We don’t want our users to be confused or frustrated when using the system.<p class="message sent">Definitely not. So, how long do you think this process will take?<p class=message>Hmm, I’m not sure. It could take a couple of weeks, or maybe even a month.<p class="message sent">That’s not too bad. After that, what’s left?<p class=message>We need to train our employees on how to use the new system.<p class="message sent">Right. We should make sure everyone knows how to use it properly, so we can boost productivity.<p class=message>Great idea. And we should also provide ongoing support to our users, in case they have any issues.<p class="message sent">Yep, that’s important too. We don’t want to leave our users stranded.<p class=message>Absolutely. Alright then, let’s get started on this project! It’s going to be a lot of work, but I’m sure we can do it.<p class="message sent">Agreed! I’m excited to see the new system in action.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9332ab9e-85cc-4619-86be-a9f1ec2cf3ab.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
