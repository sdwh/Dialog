What do you think of it?<p class="message sent">Well, it's important for keeping track of who has access to what data and when.<p class=message>Right, and it's also useful for tracking down any unauthorized access attempts or breaches.<p class="message sent">True, but it can be a pain to maintain and audit regularly.<p class=message>Definitely, but it's necessary for compliance and protecting sensitive information.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Have you seen any creative ways to manage the audit trail?<p class=message>Actually, my boss came up with an idea to automate some of the process using software.<p class="message sent">That's smart. It can save time and reduce human error.<p class=message>Yeah, plus it can generate reports for audits in real-time.<p class="message sent">That sounds impressive. What software are you guys using?<p class=message>We're currently testing out a few different options, but so far, Splunk has been the most efficient.<p class="message sent">Interesting, I'll have to look into that.<p class=message>Yeah, it's worth checking out. Are you involved in any audits right now?<p class="message sent">Not at the moment, but I'll be preparing for one in the next few months.<p class=message>Good luck with that. They can be stressful but it's always satisfying to pass with flying colors.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'll need it. How about you, any upcoming audits?<p class=message>Not at the moment, but you never know when one will come up. It's always better to be prepared.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, especially when dealing with sensitive information.<p class=message>Right, better safe than sorry.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Well, it was nice chatting with you about ISO 27001.<p class=message>Same to you, B. Have a good one.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a489db7f-1eaf-413b-9389-2b4241ff69e6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
