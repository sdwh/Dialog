May I please have your ID and credit card, Sir?<p class="message sent">Sure, here you go.<p class=message>Thank you, Mr. Smith. Everything seems to be in order.

It's quite delicious.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! Can I also get some extra pillows for my room?<p class=message>Of course, I'll have housekeeping bring some up to you right away. Do you need help with your luggage?<p class="message sent">No, thank you. I was able to manage it. However, what about parking?<p class=message>We have a secure car park on the premises for our guests, and it's complimentary. I'll give you a pass to display on your dashboard.<p class="message sent">Awesome service! You really make everything so easy for me.<p class=message>Thank you so much for your kind words. We are glad to help in any way we can. If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call us anytime.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I will. Have a great day!<p class=message>You too, Sir.
