How's the bread-making going?<p class="message sent">It's going well, A! I just made a fresh batch of sourdough bread. Would you like to try some?<p class=message>Of course! I'm always in for some freshly baked bread. Let's have some with some butter.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! And while we enjoy this beautiful sourdough, I want to ask you, do you have any new tips for my bread making?<p class=message>Yes, I do. I recently learned about adding honey to bread dough to make it extra soft and sweet.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. I will have to try that out! But speaking of sweet breads, have you tried making cinnamon rolls yet? They are very popular here.<p class=message>I haven't but I'd love to try. Do you have a recipe to share?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Come over to my workstation, and I'll show you the ropes.<p class=message>Thanks, B! Your cinnamon roll recipe looks amazing. I can't wait to bake these at home.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! I'm glad I could teach you something new.<p class=message>Do you have any other favorite breads to bake here in San Diego?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I love making focaccia and ciabatta bread. They are great for sandwiches and make any meal more flavorful.<p class=message>Oh, I love those too. Do you have any secret ingredients or tips for those breads?<p class="message sent">Yes, my secret ingredient is olive oil. It gives the bread a great taste and soft texture.<p class=message>Olive oil, that's a great idea. Thanks for sharing your secrets with me.<p class="message sent">Of course! It's always great to share knowledge and help each other become better bakers.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Thanks for being such an awesome coworker!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Let's continue to make amazing bread together for our customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a0425090-88d9-448c-9441-305eea24b1eb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
