How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there, I'm actually here to work on my blending skills for making milk tea. Would you be able to teach me some tips?<p class=message>Of course, I'd be happy to help. But first, why don't you try our signature dish, Dan Dan noodles? It's a local favorite.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. And while I try it, can you tell me what type of tea works best with milk tea?<p class=message>Well, it really depends on personal taste, but I find that oolong tea or black tea works best for creating a flavorful base.<p class="message sent">Interesting. And what about the milk? Should I use whole, skimmed or some other type?<p class=message>I would suggest using whole milk, as it gives the tea a creamier texture. But if you want a healthier option, you could use almond or soy milk.<p class="message sent">Great, thanks for the advice. By the way, how long have you been making noodles for?<p class=message>I've been a noodle chef for over 20 years now. It's a tradition that runs in my family, and I take pride in carrying it on.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. I wish I had that kind of passion for something.<p class=message>It's all about finding what you love to do and enjoying the process. It makes the end result even more satisfying.<p class="message sent">Speaking of results, I think I've got the hang of this milk tea blending now. Want to try the one I just made?<p class=message>I would love to! Hmm, this is really good. Your skills are coming along nicely.<p class="message sent">Yay, I'm so glad you like it! It's been great talking to you, A. I've learned so much.<p class=message>It was my pleasure, B. Come back anytime, and I'll teach you how to make some authentic Shanghai-style noodle dishes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=34c429dd-ea9d-4b55-8dbd-34f81f07560c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
