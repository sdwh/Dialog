Where can I take you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm visiting from the U.S. and I want to see Melbourne's top sights.<p class=message>Great! This city has a lot to offer. Any specific places you're interested in?<p class="message sent">I heard the graffiti street art is really unique here. Can you take me there first?<p class=message>Sure thing! Hosier Lane is the place to go. They change the art frequently so there's always something new to see.<p class="message sent">Wow, these murals are amazing! I'm definitely taking some photos here.<p class=message>Glad you like it! What else do you want to see while you're here?<p class="message sent">Well, I love animals. Is there a zoo in Melbourne?<p class=message>Absolutely! Melbourne Zoo has over 300 species of animals, including kangaroos and koalas.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a must-see. How about restaurants? What's your favorite place to eat?<p class=message>Oh man, there are so many great places. But if I had to pick just one, I'd say the American BBQ joint called Fancy Hank's. You'll love it!<p class="message sent">You read my mind! I was actually craving some good BBQ. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class=message>No problem. And if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask. I'm happy to help.<p class="message sent">That's very kind of you. It's been a pleasure chatting with you.<p class=message>Likewise. Have fun exploring Melbourne!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=229bd4ea-d524-4607-8db2-10b4bc7a7786.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
