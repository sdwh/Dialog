Planning to work on anything exciting today?<p class="message sent">Hey A, not much planned for today. Just some regular coding in Ruby on rails. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. Just working on a module to optimize the database queries. But hey, have you watched the new Marvel movie yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet. I heard it's fantastic. Have you seen it?<p class=message>Oh yeah, it's amazing. I won't spoil anything but the action sequences were mind blowing. Definitely worth a watch.<p class="message sent">I'll make sure to see it then. So, have you tried the new coffee place around the block?<p class=message>Yes, I did. The coffee was great and the ambience was very relaxing. I actually went there yesterday.<p class="message sent">I've been meaning to try it out. Maybe we can go there together for a coffee break sometime this week.<p class=message>Sure, that sounds like a plan. How about Wednesday at 3 pm?<p class="message sent">Perfect. So, have you heard about the new feature we're planning to introduce in our app?<p class=message>No, what's that?<p class="message sent">We're planning to integrate facial recognition for authentication purposes. It's gonna be a game changer.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds impressive. Can't wait to see how it turns out.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's gonna be exciting to work on. Anyways, I better get back to coding. Talk to you later.<p class=message>Alright, catch you later. Good luck with the coding!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5b55f71-10f1-42c8-840d-7a15b671793f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
