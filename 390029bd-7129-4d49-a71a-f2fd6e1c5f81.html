Do you want to help me decorate them?<p class=message>Of course, I love decorating cupcakes. What color frosting are you using?<p class="message sent">I'm using pink frosting and I have these cute little heart sprinkles to put on top.<p class=message>Oh, those look adorable. How about we add some blue and yellow sugar pearls to make them extra colorful?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea, mom. Should we also use some chocolate chips to give them some texture?<p class=message>Yes, I think that would be perfect. I love a little crunch in my cupcakes.<p class="message sent">Me too! Hey mom, do you remember the first time we made cupcakes together?<p class=message>Of course, how can I forget? You were so little and kept sneaking bites of the batter.<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah I remember that. You had to keep telling me to stop so we could actually have enough batter to bake.<p class=message>Good times. Hey, do you want to try making some banana bread next time?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been wanting to make that for a while. We can add some walnuts and cinnamon to make it even better.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Ok, these cupcakes look amazing. Let's try one!<p class="message sent">Mmm, these are delicious. You were right, the chocolate chips add a great crunch.<p class=message>I'm glad you like them. Maybe we should open up our own cupcake bakery one day.<p class="message sent">Haha, who knows? Maybe we'll become the next Martha Stewart and build a baking empire.<p class=message>Anything can happen. But for now, let's just enjoy our cupcakes together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=38fff8fd-dfc9-4b81-9e69-9436996cbeca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
