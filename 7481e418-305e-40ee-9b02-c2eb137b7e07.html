I was wondering if you could update me on the progress of the project.<p class="message sent">Hey A, everything is going great, actually. We're right on track with our development schedule.<p class=message>That's fantastic! As you know, we have a tight deadline to meet, so I'm glad to hear that we're making good progress. What's on the schedule for this week?<p class="message sent">This week we're working on testing and debugging the functionality of the new features we've implemented from last week's sprint.<p class=message>That's great. So, should I put in some time for monitoring the progress during this week?<p class="message sent">That depends, but generally speaking, it would be a good idea to check in at least once or twice this week to see how things are going.<p class=message>Okay, I'll do that. So, what's on the horizon for next week's sprint?<p class="message sent">Next week we'll be working on adding some new features that our client has requested, so it will be quite busy, but we're confident we'll be able to deliver on time.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work, but I have faith in our team's ability to deliver. Thanks for the update, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always great working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=74799293-de72-41eb-98e6-b49c53823c39.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
