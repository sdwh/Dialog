Where to today?<p class=message>I'm heading into Taipei to do some shopping and meet up with some friends. Have you driven there before?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I'm familiar with the ins and outs of Taipei. You got any favorite places to shop?<p class=message>Well, I've heard about this night market in Shilin that has really good food and clothing stalls. Have you ever been there?<p class="message sent">Shilin Night Market? Oh, you betcha! It's one of the most popular night markets around. You're gonna have a blast there.<p class=message>Awesome! I'm getting excited just thinking about it. Do you have any recommendations for what I should try out there?<p class="message sent">Definitely the stinky tofu. It's a smelly dish, but it's got an unforgettable taste. And if you like bubble tea, there are tons of shops selling it there.<p class=message>Stinky tofu? Hmm, I'll have to give it a try. And I love bubble tea! Thanks for the tips.<p class="message sent">No problem. Just be warned, the crowds at the night market can get pretty crazy, especially on weekends.<p class=message>That's good to know. I'll be sure to arm myself with some patience. By the way, have you heard any good jokes lately?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. Oh yeah, I saw this one on the internet. Why was six afraid of seven?<p class=message>Why?<p class="message sent">Because seven eight nine! (laughs)<p class=message>(laughs) That's a good one. Here's one for you: Why did the tomato turn red?<p class="message sent">I don't know, why?<p class=message>Because it saw the salad dressing! (laughs)<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's clever. You know, I always enjoy a good laugh with my passengers. It makes the ride more enjoyable.<p class=message>I completely agree. It's nice to have a friendly chat on my way to my destination. Hey, we're almost there! Thanks for the ride and the great conversation.<p class="message sent">No problem, have a great time at the night market and with your friends. Take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c7a6ecb4-4243-4c9e-80fe-38f4c91d3fdd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
