How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain! It's been a busy day so far, but I'm always happy to help keep everyone safe.<p class="message sent">I appreciate that. So what exactly are you looking for during the security checks?<p class=message>Just your standard items, like bags, cameras, and any prohibited items like weapons or alcohol.<p class="message sent">Got it, I left anything like that at home. But I do have a water bottle with me, is that okay?<p class=message>Absolutely! We just ask that it's not open when you come in.<p class="message sent">That's no problem, I can easily keep it closed until I'm inside.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Do you have any questions about the venue or the concert tonight?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I was wondering if there's a specific dress code for the concert.<p class=message>Nope, there's no dress code tonight. Just wear something comfortable and appropriate for the weather, and you'll be good to go.<p class="message sent">Great to know, thanks for the heads up. And one final question - what's the best way to find my seat once I'm inside?<p class=message>Just look for any signs or ushers who can direct you to your section. And don't hesitate to ask anyone for help- we're all here to make sure you have a great time tonight.<p class="message sent">Thanks so much for all the help, I really appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem at all. Have a fantastic time at the concert tonight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4927059c-3a28-43a0-ba43-4878ff7a3feb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
