Are you the server for this section?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. How may I assist you today?<p class=message>I'd like to place an order for our customers. They're interested in trying out some of our best desserts.<p class="message sent">Great! What would you recommend from our menu?<p class=message>My personal favorite is the chocolate mousse cake, but I've also heard great things about the raspberry sorbet.<p class="message sent">Those do sound delicious! Would you like me to have those prepared now, or should I wait for you to finish?<p class=message>I'm actually in the middle of making a batch of cupcakes. Would you like to help me finish them while we wait for the desserts?<p class="message sent">Sure, why not? I've always wanted to try making cupcakes.<p class=message>Great! Just follow my lead and we'll have a fresh batch in no time.<p class="message sent">Wow, this is harder than it looks. How do you get the frosting to look so perfect?<p class=message>It takes a bit of practice, but the key is to start from the center and work your way outwards in a spiral motion.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tip! I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Looks like we're ready to serve up those cupcakes with the rest of the desserts.<p class="message sent">Here you go, one chocolate mousse cake and a raspberry sorbet. Enjoy!<p class=message>Thank you so much! I have a feeling our customers are going to absolutely love these.<p class="message sent">And here are the cupcakes you made, they look amazing!<p class=message>They certainly do. I hope they taste as good as they look. Thanks for your help, it was a pleasure working with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise! I think I might have found my calling as a baker.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6fc4d260-d1d7-4a20-9557-112afb03c6cf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
