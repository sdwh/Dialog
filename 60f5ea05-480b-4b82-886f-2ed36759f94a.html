Can you help me out?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'd be happy to assist you. What seems to be the issue?<p class=message>Well, my original flight was delayed and now I'm worried about missing my connecting flight. What should I do?<p class="message sent">Let's take a look. Can I see your boarding pass and itinerary?<p class=message>Sure, here you go.<p class="message sent">Okay, I see your next flight is still a few hours away. If you're worried about missing it, we can put you on standby for an earlier flight.<p class=message>That sounds great, thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">Of course, it's my job to make sure you have a smooth travel experience. Do you have any other questions?<p class=message>Not right now, but I have to say, the airport is very busy today.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's always like this during peak travel season. But it's also the perfect time to people-watch and maybe even make some new friends.<p class=message>That's a good point. I might just do that while I wait for my flight.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And if you get hungry, there are some great places to grab a bite here too.<p class=message>Thanks again for your help. You've been really kind.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, happy travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=60f335cd-bbd2-46c6-8c59-7b9b22e8e30d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
