I'm the chef in training. Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Hey, I'm the photographer. Good to see you too!<p class=message>So, are you here to capture the beauty of Japanese cuisine?<p class="message sent">Yes, and I'm excited to learn how to make traditional wagashi with you.<p class=message>Me too! Do you know what kind we're making today?<p class="message sent">I think it's called kuzumochi. Have you made it before?<p class=message>No, but I've heard it's a bit tricky. We need to mix the kuzuko flour with water until it becomes a gooey liquid.<p class="message sent">And then we pour it into a pot and cook it while stirring constantly?<p class=message>Yes, but we have to be careful not to let it boil over. And once it's done, we add sugar and potato starch.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. I can't wait to try it.<p class=message>Me too! Oh, by the way, did you bring your camera?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I'm planning on taking some photos of the wagashi we make.<p class=message>That's great! I hope they turn out well.<p class="message sent">I'm sure they will. With you as the chef, and the beauty of Kyoto, it's going to be a great shoot.<p class=message>Ha! Thanks for the vote of confidence.<p class="message sent">No problem! Say, have you tried any other Japanese sweets?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I really like dango and daifuku. What about you?<p class="message sent">I love mochi! It's chewy and sweet, just the way I like it.<p class=message>That's true. Well, time to get started on our kuzumochi. Let's make it delicious!<p class="message sent">Definitely! And I'll be sure to snap some great shots along the way.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=238135ae-4970-4071-8cc8-34b3830bf8a5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
