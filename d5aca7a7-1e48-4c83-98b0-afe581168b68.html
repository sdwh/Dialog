I'm excited to review your writing.<p class=message>Thanks, I hope it's not too terrible.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Don't worry, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.<p class=message>That's reassuring. So, what did you think of the first chapter?<p class="message sent">I think it's a good start, but I noticed you use a lot of passive voice. Is there a reason for that?<p class=message>Hmm, I never really thought about it. I just wanted to sound more sophisticated.<p class="message sent">I understand, but using active voice can make your writing more engaging and concise.<p class=message>Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Did you have any favorite parts?<p class="message sent">Definitely the dialogue between the characters. It felt very natural and authentic.<p class=message>That's great to hear! I'm glad you liked it.<p class="message sent">Overall, I think you have a lot of potential. With a bit of polishing, your book could be a hit!<p class=message>Thank you, that means a lot coming from you. I'll take your feedback to heart and work on improving my writing.<p class="message sent">I'm looking forward to seeing the final product. And don't forget to treat yourself to another cup of coffee!<p class=message>Absolutely, let's grab a refill before we get back to work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d5a71081-a9fd-4c22-af89-d8b4945bca90.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
