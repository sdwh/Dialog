You mentioned that you're interested in learning ASP.NET Core. That's great!<p class="message sent">Yes, I heard that cross-platform development with ASP.NET Core is becoming increasingly popular.<p class=message>Absolutely! One of the best things about ASP.NET Core is that you can use it to create web applications that run on Windows, Mac, or Linux.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. Where do I start?<p class=message>You'll need to have a basic understanding of C# and HTML/CSS. Do you have any experience with those?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've worked with HTML/CSS before, but I'm not very experienced with C#.<p class=message>No problem, C# is a great language to learn. You might want to take an online course to get started. The Microsoft official website offers some great materials on learning ASP.NET Core.<p class="message sent">Okay, thanks! What about practice?<p class=message>You should definitely practice by building some simple projects. Start with something small like a blog or a personal website to get the hang of it. There are also many tutorials and projects on GitHub where you can learn from experienced developers.<p class="message sent">I see. I'm eager to start learning and practicing!<p class=message>That's the right attitude! Just remember that learning takes time and practice. Don't get discouraged if things don't click right away.<p class="message sent">I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the guidance, A!<p class=message>No problem at all, B. Enjoy the journey of becoming an ASP.NET Core developer!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e30331d-679e-462c-96e7-e7a3d2db24a9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
