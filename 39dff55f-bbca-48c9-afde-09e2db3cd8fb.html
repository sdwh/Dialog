Are you planning on singing any tunes?<p class=message>I'm not very good at singing, but I might give it a try after a few drinks. What about you?<p class="message sent">Ha!

You'll definitely be the star of the party.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'm happy to contribute. Anything to celebrate our success and bring the team together.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more.
