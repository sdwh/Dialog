I'm glad we're finally exploring the food scene in Chaozhou, Guangdong.<p class="message sent">Yes, me too, A! I've heard that Chaozhou is famous for its seafood and authentic Cantonese dishes.<p class=message>That's right! And did you know that Chaozhou is also called the "capital of tea" in China?<p class="message sent">Really? I thought it was just famous for the culinary arts.<p class=message>There's more to it than meets the eye, B. Speaking of culinary arts, have you tried the Chaozhou-styled boiled goose?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but let's not forget the Chaozhou-styled beef soup noodles! They're a must-try!<p class=message>Absolutely! And let's not forget the sweets! Chaozhou has these traditional desserts, like the peanut candy and glutinous rice dumplings filled with sweet red bean paste.<p class="message sent">Wow, you're making me hungry, A! Speaking of desserts, have you heard of the Chaozhou woodcarving sugar figurines? They're almost too cute to eat!<p class=message>I've heard of those! They look like little works of art.<p class="message sent">And how about we top off our food adventure with a visit to the Chaozhou Ancient City Wall? We can walk off all those calories and learn about history at the same time.<p class=message>Great idea, B! I'm really looking forward to exploring more of Chaozhou's culture and cuisine with you.<p class="message sent">Same here, A! Let's get started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a6c3e01f-7197-44a0-b482-e97fc889037d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
