I'm A, and I'm a baker. Are you ready to learn how to make some amazing Spanish desserts today, B?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm B, and absolutely! I've never tried making any Spanish desserts before, so I'm excited to learn something new.<p class=message>Great! Our first dish will be the famous churros. It's pretty easy to make- flour, water, and a little bit of salt. Have you heard of them before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have heard of churros, and I've tasted them too! But I never knew they were so simple to make. Do we need any other ingredients?<p class=message>Hmm, not really. We can add some spices and sugar to make them more flavorful. Would you like to give it a try?<p class="message sent">Definitely! Can you show me how to make the dough first?<p class=message>Sure thing! So we mix the flour, salt, and water together until it's smooth. Then we transfer it to a piping bag and pipe it into hot oil. And voila! Churros!<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that looks easy! I think I can do it. What's next on our list?<p class=message>Next up, we have flan. It's a creamy, custardy dessert that's served cold. We'll need sugar, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract. It's a little bit more complex than churros, but I'm sure you'll do great.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious already! Alright, show me the steps.<p class=message>So first, we need to caramelize the sugar until it's golden. Then we whisk the eggs, milk, and vanilla extract together and pour it over the caramel. Then we cook it in a water bath until it's set. And there you have it- flan!<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that looks yummy. I can't wait to try it! Thanks for showing me how to make these desserts, A. You're an amazing baker!<p class=message>No problem at all, B. It was my pleasure to teach you. Who knows, maybe one day you'll become a professional baker like me!<p class="message sent">Haha, I highly doubt that, but I'll definitely use these skills to impress my friends and family. Thanks again, A!<p class=message>My pleasure, B. Have fun experimenting with Spanish desserts!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0b2f6e3b-2693-442c-a394-e6e279d1f858.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
