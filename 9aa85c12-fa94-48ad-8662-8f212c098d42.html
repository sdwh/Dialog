The ocean covers 71% of the Earth's surface, so it has to be good for something other than surfing and fishing, right?<p class=message>Exactly! I believe ocean energy can be the next big thing in renewable energy. Have you heard about tidal energy?<p class="message sent">Yes, tidal energy is created by the rise and fall of ocean tides. It's definitely something to explore.<p class=message>Another idea is wave energy. Waves are caused by wind, and wind is a form of solar energy. So, it's basically free energy!<p class="message sent">That's a great point. However, harnessing wave energy can be challenging because waves are unpredictable.<p class=message>True, but there are wave energy converters that can smooth out the waves and capture the energy.<p class="message sent">Interesting. What about ocean thermal energy? It's created by the temperature difference between the warm surface water and the cold deep water.<p class=message>Yes, that's another option. And since the ocean is a huge heat sink, the energy source is constant.<p class="message sent">I agree. We should definitely look into developing ocean energy systems. It would be great for the environment and for supplying energy to remote coastal areas.<p class=message>Plus, it's exciting to think about being a part of a new frontier of sustainable energy.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Who knows, we might even discover something new in the process!<p class=message>Well, I'm definitely up for the challenge. Let's make waves in the ocean energy industry!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9aa794e5-41f6-4994-bbf1-7e5e22398367.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
