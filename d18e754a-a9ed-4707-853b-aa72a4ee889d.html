I heard they're discussing how to establish an effective cybersecurity strategy.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's interesting. I hope they include some fun and creative measures to protect against cyberattacks.<p class=message>Like what?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, a mandatory game of "Guess the Password" during employee orientations.<p class=message>(laughs) I like that idea! And they could also have a "Phishing Scam Challenge" where the winner gets a prize.<p class="message sent">Yes, and they could create a "Hack-proof" zone in the office where employees have to navigate different cybersecurity challenges.<p class=message>That's brilliant! As long as they don't make it too difficult, or else no one will even bother trying.<p class="message sent">Agreed. But it's important to remember that the best defense is a good offense, so the security team should work on implementing strong firewalls and regular software updates.<p class=message>Definitely! And they should also make sure everyone has a strong password policy.<p class="message sent">Right, that's an absolute must. I'm feeling much better about the government's cybersecurity measures now.<p class=message>Same here! Let's hope they continue to keep our sensitive information secure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d18e5ba4-3444-476c-b3de-a849b90d469c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
