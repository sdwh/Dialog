Can you teach me how to play?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Have you played before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time. But I've always been curious about it.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me explain the basics. The objective is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. We'll both be dealt two cards.<p class=message>Okay, I think I understand. Do I need to memorize the values of the cards?<p class="message sent">Not really, the numbered cards are worth their face value, the face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are all worth 10, and the Ace can be worth 1 or 11.<p class=message>Got it. So what happens next?<p class="message sent">You can choose to "hit" and receive another card, or "stand" and keep your current total. We'll take turns until we either both stand, go over 21, or one of us gets blackjack (an Ace plus a 10-value card).<p class=message>Alright, let's give it a go.<p class="message sent">Good luck! I'll deal the first cards... You have a 6 and I have a Jack.<p class=message>Hmm, I think I'll hit.<p class="message sent">You got a 4, so you have a total of 10. Do you want to hit again?<p class=message>Yes, I think I'll take another card.<p class="message sent">It's a Queen, so you have 20. Do you want to stand?<p class=message>Yes, I'll stand.<p class="message sent">Alright, it's my turn... I have a 5 and a 2, so I have 7. I'll hit and get a 9, making my total 16. I think I'll have to hit again.<p class=message>This is getting exciting!<p class="message sent">And I got another 9, making my total 25. Bust... which means you win!<p class=message>Woohoo! Thanks for teaching me how to play. I think I'm hooked now.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e5437009-7595-47b4-989c-56ffc5f54a9a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
