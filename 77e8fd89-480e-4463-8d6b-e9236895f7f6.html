How may I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm a student here and I wanted to discuss the student enrollment process.<p class=message>Sure, I'd be happy to help. What do you want to know?<p class="message sent">Well, I was wondering how the college attracts new students.<p class=message>Good question. We use a variety of methods, including social media, print publications, and college fairs. We also have a referral program for current students.<p class="message sent">That sounds very effective. How do you measure the success of these marketing efforts?<p class=message>We track our enrollment numbers each semester and use that data to see which methods are most successful. We also ask new students how they heard about our college.<p class="message sent">Interesting. Do you have any upcoming marketing events that I could participate in?<p class=message>We're hosting a college fair next month. You should definitely come and check it out.<p class="message sent">Sounds great. Is there anything else I should know about the enrollment process?<p class=message>You should apply as soon as possible to ensure that you receive financial aid and have the best chance of getting into your desired program.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice. You've been very helpful.<p class=message>No problem at all. It was nice talking with you.
