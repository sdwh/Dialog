Thank you for coming in today to go over your financial report.<p class="message sent">Of course, I'm excited to see how things are shaping up for my business.<p class=message>Well, I have good news and bad news. Which one do you want to hear first?<p class="message sent">Let's hear the bad news first, so we can end on a positive note.<p class=message>Fair enough. So, you overspent on your marketing budget this quarter. But don't worry, we can adjust it for next quarter.<p class="message sent">Ah, that's a bummer. But I'm glad we caught it early, I guess.<p class=message>Absolutely. And now for the good news, your sales have increased by 20% since last quarter. Congratulations!<p class="message sent">That's amazing! I knew all those late nights were worth it.<p class=message>Yes, your hard work paid off. And I wanted to let you know that we found a more cost-effective way to handle your taxes, so you'll be saving quite a bit of money next year.<p class="message sent">Wow, this is turning out to be a great day. This calls for a celebration!<p class=message>I agree! How about we go out for lunch to celebrate your success?<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it! And maybe we can discuss ideas for next quarter.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. And don't worry, we'll make sure to keep your spending on track.<p class="message sent">I appreciate it. Thanks for all your help, A.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, B. Let's go grab that lunch!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8f71fffd-26f3-44a3-8656-fe12916117d9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
