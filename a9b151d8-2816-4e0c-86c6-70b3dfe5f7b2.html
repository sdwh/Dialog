When is it happening?<p class=message>It's in three months. She's getting married to John and they're planning a big party.<p class="message sent">That sounds awesome. Where are they hosting it?<p class=message>At a fancy hotel downtown. I heard they're going all out with the decorations.<p class="message sent">Ooh la la, fancy! How about the food?<p class=message>They're having a three-course meal with a build-your-own sundae bar for dessert.<p class="message sent">That's my kind of party! Did they invite a lot of people?<p class=message>Yeah, it's a pretty big guest list. I think around 200 people.<p class="message sent">Wow, sounds like a lot of dancing and mingling. Are you bringing a date?<p class=message>Not sure yet, but I might ask that cute guy from work.<p class="message sent">Go for it! What are you going to wear?<p class=message>I'm thinking a cocktail dress with some killer heels. How about you?<p class="message sent">I haven't decided yet, but I'm thinking of wearing a suit. Gotta be sharp for those wedding photos, you know?<p class=message>Absolutely! Speaking of photos, did you see the custom Snapchat filter they made for the occasion?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. That's so cool!<p class=message>I know, right? Sarah's really going all out for this wedding.<p class="message sent">She deserves it. She's been dreaming of this day since we were in high school.<p class=message>Yeah, it's amazing to see her happy and in love. I can't wait to celebrate with her.<p class="message sent">Me too! Let's make sure we dance the night away and have a blast!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a9b012ae-2908-48ee-bc67-9c76051dddbc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
