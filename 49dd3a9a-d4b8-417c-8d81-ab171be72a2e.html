How's it going?<p class="message sent">Oh, pretty busy as usual. Just finished making a fresh batch of egg tarts. What's up?<p class=message>I was thinking, since we have all these amazing Cantonese-style desserts, why not do something special for Chinese New Year?<p class="message sent">Ooh, I love the sound of that. What did you have in mind?<p class=message>How about we make some traditional Nin Gou (rice cake)? It's one of my favorite Chinese New Year delicacies.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. I'll get started on it right away. And maybe we could even make some Jiandui (sesame balls) too.<p class=message>Perfect! I'll make sure we have all the ingredients we need. And maybe we could even decorate the shop with some red lanterns and banners to really get into the spirit of the holiday.<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it! I already feel like I'm celebrating just thinking about it.<p class=message>That's what we're all about here in Chinatown! Making our customers feel like family.<p class="message sent">Speaking of family, I heard you're expecting a new member soon?<p class=message>Yes, my wife is due in a couple of months! We're so excited.<p class="message sent">That's wonderful news. You know what they say, children are the ultimate blessing.<p class=message>Absolutely. And speaking of blessings, let me give you some of our famous egg tarts as a token of thanks for being such a great partner.<p class="message sent">Wow, thank you so much! You really know how to make a guy's day.<p class=message>Hey, that's what partnership is all about. We both work hard, but it's the little things that make it all worthwhile.<p class="message sent">Couldn't have said it better myself. Here's hoping this Chinese New Year brings us even more good fortune.<p class=message>I'll drink to that! Let me grab us some tea to celebrate.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=49d83a40-95ae-4a1d-ab3b-749909cec2fd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
