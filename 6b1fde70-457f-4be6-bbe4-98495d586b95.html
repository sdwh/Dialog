Do you have any funny stories from driving a taxi in Beijing?<p class="message sent">One time I had a passenger who wanted me to drive her to the airport in 20 minutes, but it was rush hour traffic! I managed to get her there on time, but it was a wild ride.<p class=message>Wow, that must have been intense! What do you like most about being a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I love meeting people from all over the world and learning about their cultures. It's also rewarding to help people get to where they need to go.<p class=message>That's great to hear.

But I try my best to navigate around them.<p class=message>Well, I'm glad you know your way around.
