I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it?<p class=message>Yes, I flew in from London last night and my luggage never showed up at the baggage claim.<p class="message sent">Oh no, that's definitely not a good start to your trip. I'm here to assist you with the process of reporting the loss. Do you have your baggage tag number?<p class=message>Yes, let me look for it. (rummaging through bag) Here it is.<p class="message sent">Okay, let me check if there's any update on it. (checking the computer) I'm sorry, but we haven't received any information on your luggage yet. Can you describe it for me?<p class=message>It's black and has a pink ribbon tied around it. It's a pretty ordinary suitcase, but it has sentimental value to me.<p class="message sent">Got it. Let me file a report on this and I'll keep you updated on its whereabouts. In the meantime, I can provide you with some toiletries and basic necessities if you need them.<p class=message>Thank you so much, that's very kind of you.<p class="message sent">It's our pleasure. And don't worry, we'll do everything we can to locate your luggage. In the meantime, is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>Actually, I'm not sure how to get to my hotel from here.<p class="message sent">Not a problem, I can provide you with a map and directions. Are you planning to take a taxi or public transportation?<p class=message>I think I'll take a taxi.<p class="message sent">Okay, let me write down the address for you and we can arrange for a taxi to pick you up right outside the terminal.<p class=message>That would be great! Thank you for your help.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Have a wonderful stay here in our city, and hopefully your luggage will be found soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=980d6608-a59a-4c4d-9281-3ad30110619a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
