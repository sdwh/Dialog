Exciting!<p class="message sent">Yes, it's always interesting to plan and build new network infrastructure from scratch.<p class=message>Absolutely. And it's crucial to keep in mind the security aspect since many new threats have emerged in recent years.<p class="message sent">True. A secure network is the backbone of any modern organization. We should prioritize this.<p class=message>I agree. What do you think about password security? Should we require employees to change their passwords frequently?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Password hygiene is a must. We could even adopt biometric authentication for better security.<p class=message>That's an excellent idea. We can use fingerprints or face recognition for easy access.<p class="message sent">We should also implement firewalls and intrusion detection systems to filter traffic and prevent unauthorized access.<p class=message>Yes, firewalls are a basic requirement in any secure network. We should also limit access to critical data.<p class="message sent">And we must regularly backup our data and store it offsite to prevent data loss in case of a disaster.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we shouldn't forget about employee education. They need to understand security best practices and be vigilant.<p class="message sent">That's crucial. We should organize security training sessions periodically.<p class=message>And finally, we must stay updated on the latest security trends and keep our network up to date with the latest patches.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We should have a dedicated team to monitor network security and respond to incidents promptly.<p class=message>Great ideas, B. I'm looking forward to working together on this project to create a secure and reliable network for our organization.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b0f3b297-d053-4048-b17d-b325a7f2ddeb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
