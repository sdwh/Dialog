Have you decided on what to order?<p class="message sent">Actually, we're interested in trying your famous Swiss cheese fondue. Can you give us any recommendations?<p class=message>Absolutely. We have a selection of Swiss cheeses including Gruy√®re, Emmental, and Appenzeller. We recommend a combination of two or three cheeses for the best flavor.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Can you also recommend any sides?<p class=message>We have a variety of sides that pair well with the fondue, such as boiled potatoes, bread cubes, and steamed vegetables.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. Can you also suggest a wine pairing for the fondue?<p class=message>Of course, we have a great selection of wines from the region. I would recommend a crisp Chasselas, a dry Riesling or a Pinot Noir to balance the richness of the cheese.<p class="message sent">That's very helpful, thank you. How long does it take to prepare the fondue?<p class=message>It takes about 20 minutes to prepare, but it's definitely worth the wait.<p class="message sent">I'm sure it is. By the way, have you ever tried the fondue yourselves?<p class=message>Oh yes, we have it at least once a week. It's a Swiss tradition!<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I'm sure it's delicious. Alright, we'll take the Swiss cheese fondue with boiled potatoes, bread cubes and steamed vegetables, and a bottle of dry Riesling.<p class=message>Excellent choice! Your order will be ready shortly. Enjoy your meal!<p class="message sent">Thank you very much. We are looking forward to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2c9cb3cd-15f6-417e-a6b1-6fbbee64fc8d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
