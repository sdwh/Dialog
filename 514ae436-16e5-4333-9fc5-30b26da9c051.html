Have you tried the new salad place down the street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's good there?<p class=message>Everything! Their Caesar salad is to die for.<p class="message sent">I'm more of a Greek salad person myself. Who needs croutons when you have feta cheese?<p class=message>Fair enough. But have you ever tried adding fruit to your salad?<p class="message sent">Fruit? That sounds odd.<p class=message>Trust me, it's a game changer. Try adding some sliced strawberries or mandarin oranges to your next salad.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I might have to give that a try. But I will always have a soft spot for a classic Cobb salad.<p class=message>Can't go wrong with a Cobb salad. But what about dressing? Are you a vinaigrette or ranch person?<p class="message sent">Definitely ranch. I know it's not the healthiest, but it just tastes so good.<p class=message>Hey, a little bit of indulgence is totally okay. It's all about balance, right?<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. And speaking of balance, have you heard of the taco salad diet?<p class=message>Uh, no. But it sounds intriguing.<p class="message sent">Basically, you can eat as much taco salad as you want as long as it's the main dish for every meal.<p class=message>Hmm...I don't know if that's the healthiest option.<p class="message sent">True, but it still sounds delicious!<p class=message>Agreed. And on that note, I think it's time for a trip to the salad bar. Who's with me?<p class="message sent">Count me in! Let's go get our greens on!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=514a47de-024c-46a9-8980-ed15565baf60.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
