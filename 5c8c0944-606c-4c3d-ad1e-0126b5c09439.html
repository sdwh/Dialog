It's great to be here in Nagasaki's fish market. I'm excited to choose some fresh ingredients for our cooking lesson today.<p class="message sent">Hi A. Yes, this market has a lot of variety. Let's start by looking for some fresh fish. Do you have any preference?<p class=message>Hmm, how about some local specialties like saba or squid? I'm not so familiar with them in my hometown.<p class="message sent">Sure, saba is a type of mackerel that's popular here. And squid is a versatile seafood that's used in many dishes. How about we get both?<p class=message>Great idea! This market is very lively and bustling. It's amazing to see the vendors prepare the fish in front of their customers.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. This is a traditional market that has been around for more than 100 years. Let's also get some vegetables and spices for our cooking lesson.<p class=message>Sounds good. Look at those colorful eggplants and tomatoes. And those bunches of fresh herbs!<p class="message sent">We could use those herbs to make a traditional dish called tempura. Have you tried it before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Can you teach me how to make it?<p class="message sent">Of course, let's go to my kitchen and start cooking. First, we need to prepare the batter and then we'll coat the fish and veggies in it before frying them.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. I love learning new recipes and techniques.<p class="message sent">It'll be an experience you won't forget. And we'll get to enjoy the fruits of our labor afterwards.<p class=message>I can't wait to try it! Thank you for being such a helpful guide and cooking partner, B.<p class="message sent">No worries, it's my pleasure. And I'm glad I can share my love of local cuisine with you, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5c84f1eb-95f8-4e89-8f88-1ee270e84cf5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
