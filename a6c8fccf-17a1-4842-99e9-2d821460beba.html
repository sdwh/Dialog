My name is Linda. Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Hi Linda, I’m Nick, a tour guide in this area. It’s my pleasure to meet you too. What do you want to know about our marine conservation efforts here?<p class=message>Well, I’m very impressed with the clear water and amazing marine life here. How do you make sure that this place stays this way?<p class="message sent">We have several programs in place, such as limiting the number of boats that can anchor here and conducting regular beach clean-ups. We also educate tourists about responsible waste disposal.<p class=message>That’s amazing! Do you know what kinds of marine species live in this area?<p class="message sent">Yes, there are different kinds of fish, clams, crabs, and even sea turtles. Have you tried snorkeling here?<p class=message>Not yet, but I definitely want to! Can I see sea turtles while snorkeling?<p class="message sent">Definitely! They are often spotted swimming in the shallow waters. Just remember not to touch them or disturb their habitat.<p class=message>Got it. I’ll keep that in mind. By the way, do you know of any coral reefs nearby?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a few coral reefs that are off-limits to tourists to protect them from harm. But we can still appreciate them from a distance.<p class=message>I see. It’s great to know that there are efforts to preserve the marine ecosystem. Thank you for sharing with me, Nick.<p class="message sent">You’re welcome, Linda. Enjoy your stay here and have fun exploring our beautiful underwater world!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a6c4f456-63ee-4961-a530-d3f62421b07a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
