Why do you ask?<p class=message>I've been considering getting certified in it. Do you think it would be worth it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's becoming increasingly important in the IT field. Better to be ahead of the game than struggling to catch up later.<p class=message>That's a good point. Have you ever worked with it before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I actually helped my previous company become ISO 27001 compliant.<p class=message>That's awesome! What are some of the biggest challenges you faced?<p class="message sent">Definitely convincing management to allocate the necessary resources and time. It's a big undertaking.<p class=message>I can imagine. Would you be able to give me some tips on how to approach it?<p class="message sent">Sure! First, it's important to understand and plan for the scope of the project. Then, get buy-in and support from management. From there, it's easier to implement and maintain the standard.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice! Do you think it's necessary to have a dedicated team for it?<p class="message sent">It depends on the size of the organization, but it definitely helps to have a team dedicated to the task. It ensures that everything is being taken care of properly.<p class=message>I see. So, how long do you think it would take for a company to become certified?<p class="message sent">It really varies, but it's usually around 6-12 months for initial certification.<p class=message>Wow, that's a long time. But I guess it's worth it for the added security measures.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It not only helps protect valuable company information, but also gives customers peace of mind.<p class=message>That's a great point. Thanks for all your insights, B! I'll definitely keep them in mind as I move forward with this.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. I'm always happy to help out a fellow IT professional.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7db648f1-c89a-4835-b76c-e8566bd41556.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
