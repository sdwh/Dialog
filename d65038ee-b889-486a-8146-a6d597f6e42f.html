It's great to have a knowledgeable tour guide like you. What local dishes would you recommend we try in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Hi A! I'm glad to help. I would definitely suggest trying some sushi, ramen, and tempura. They're some of the staples in Japanese cuisine.<p class=message>That sounds fantastic! I've always loved sushi, but I'm not sure how to properly eat it. Could you teach me?<p class="message sent">Sure, A! You should dip the sushi in a bit of soy sauce, but not too much. Putting wasabi directly on the sushi is considered impolite, so it's best to mix it with soy sauce.<p class=message>Ah, I see! That's good to know. What about ramen?<p class="message sent">With ramen, it's all about personal taste. Some prefer a thick broth, while others prefer a lighter broth. You can also add a variety of toppings like pork, egg, and seaweed.<p class=message>Wow, I can't wait to try it all! Speaking of Japanese culture, what drinks do locals enjoy with their meals?<p class="message sent">Well, tea is always a popular choice. But some people also enjoy sake or beer with their meals.<p class=message>That's great to know. I heard there's a special way to pour sake?<p class="message sent">Yes, there is! When pouring for someone else, you should hold the bottle with both hands and pour until the glass overflows a little. This shows respect and generosity.<p class=message>This is all so fascinating! Thank you for sharing your knowledge with me, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A! It's always great to exchange cultural knowledge through cuisine. Let's enjoy our meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d64a7949-6f69-489e-9dff-9e8634173d9c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
