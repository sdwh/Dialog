Can you tell me your name and what brings you here today?<p class="message sent">Hey, Officer A. My name is Jake and apparently, I'm suspected of stealing a bicycle.<p class=message>Oh, wow. Do you have anything to say in your defense?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I don't know how it got to this. I recently got my own bike, so I don't see why I'd steal one.<p class=message>That's interesting. But eyewitnesses saw you near the scene of the crime.<p class="message sent">Hmm, well, maybe they mistook me for someone else. I have a doppelg√§nger out there somewhere.<p class=message>(laughs) That's quite the excuse. So, what do you do for a living, Jake?<p class="message sent">I'm a struggling artist, Officer. Just trying to make ends meet with my art.<p class=message>That's cool. Maybe you should paint a picture of the stolen bike and turn it in as evidence. (laughs)<p class="message sent">(laughs) I don't think that would work. But it's a good idea.<p class=message>Alright, Mr. B. I'm going to have to look into this matter further. But if you do have any helpful information, feel free to speak up.<p class="message sent">Sure, Officer A. If I think of anything, I'll let you know.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=59fc6c14-873d-484d-b131-6cb34709ae85.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
