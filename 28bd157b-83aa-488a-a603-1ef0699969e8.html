Have you seen the trailer?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It looks interesting. Do you think it will be scary?<p class="message sent">I'm not sure, but I heard it has some suspenseful moments. Are you scared?<p class=message>(laughs) No, I'm an actor. I'm used to scary scenes.<p class="message sent">That's true, you must have experienced a lot of scary moments in your career.<p class=message>(jokingly) Yeah, and yet I still jump at every little thing.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I hear you. Even as a director, I get spooked sometimes.<p class=message>(whispers) Do you think we should get some popcorn and candy?<p class="message sent">(whispers back) Definitely. The movie won't be complete without them.<p class=message>(smiling) Alright, let's go get some snacks. I'll get the popcorn and you can get the candy.<p class="message sent">(nodding) Sounds like a plan.<p class=message>(munching on popcorn) This is delicious.<p class="message sent">(munching on candy) I know, right? It's not a movie without some snacks.<p class=message>(laughs) You're right. Hey, do you ever get nervous watching your own movies on the big screen?<p class="message sent">(pauses) Honestly, I do. It's like seeing a part of me up there for everyone to see.<p class=message>(nodding empathetically) I understand what you mean. I feel the same way.<p class="message sent">(smiling) But at the same time, it's also thrilling to see it all come together.<p class=message>(grinning) Yeah, it's like magic.<p class=message>(whispering) So far, so good.<p class="message sent">(whispering back) Yeah, it's definitely keeping me on the edge of my seat.<p class=message>(whispering) I did not see that coming!<p class="message sent">(whispering back) Neither did I. The plot really keeps you guessing.<p class=message>(animatedly) Wow, that was intense. I never knew a movie could make me feel like that.<p class="message sent">(smiling) I'm glad you enjoyed it. It was a great movie, the actors did a fantastic job.<p class=message>(nodding) Agreed. You know, watching movies really reminds me why I became an actor.<p class="message sent">(smiling) I know the feeling. It's the perfect escape and a great way to get lost in a story.<p class=message>(grinning) Thanks again for inviting me, B. I had a great time.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Of course, anytime. We should do it again soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=28bcc077-b9cf-4d3e-8b37-497bb6730f20.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
