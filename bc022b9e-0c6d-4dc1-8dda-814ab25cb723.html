You never know what could happen.<p class="message sent">I know, but I just don't want to spend too much money on it.<p class=message>I get it. But trust me, it's worth the investment.<p class="message sent">Alright, what kind of coverage do you have?<p class=message>I opted for a package that includes medical expenses, trip cancellation, and baggage protection.<p class="message sent">Hmm, sounds pretty comprehensive. How much did you pay?<p class=message>I think it was about $150 for a two-week trip.<p class="message sent">That's not bad at all. Who did you buy it from?<p class=message>I went through a travel insurance company called World Nomads.<p class="message sent">Cool, I'll definitely check that out. Did you have to file any claims or anything?<p class=message>Luckily, I didn't need to. But I've heard they have great customer service if you do.<p class="message sent">Nice, thanks for the recommendation. I really didn't know where to start with all of this.<p class=message>No problem at all. And hey, once you're all insured, we can focus on planning some fun activities for our trip Down Under!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bbff4cc3-3027-42ee-9de5-9f9b78b791c6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
