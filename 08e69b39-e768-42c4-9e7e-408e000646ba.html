Are you excited for your flight today?<p class="message sent message-content">Hi! Yes, I am. I've never been to Melbourne before, so I can't wait to explore.<p class="message received message-content">That's great to hear! What brings you to Melbourne?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, just a quick vacation. I've always wanted to see the Great Ocean Road.<p class="message received message-content">I've been on that road before â€“ it's stunning. You'll definitely enjoy it.<p class="message sent message-content">I hope so! I heard it's quite a long drive though. How do you stay awake during those flights?<p class="message received message-content">Lots of coffee and maybe a power nap if there's time. But honestly, it's the adrenaline of flying that keeps me going.<p class="message sent message-content">I can imagine! It must be thrilling to be in control of such a big machine.<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely. It's a lot of responsibility too, but I can't imagine doing anything else.<p class="message sent message-content">I can only imagine. Do you ever get nervous before a flight?<p class="message received message-content">Of course, it's only natural. But we go through rigorous safety checks and training so we're always prepared.<p class="message sent message-content">That's reassuring to hear. Speaking of safety, do I need to take off my shoes or belt for security?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, please. And remember to take out any electronics larger than a cellphone from your bag.<p class="message sent message-content">Gotcha. Thanks for the reminder.<p class="message received message-content">No problem. Is there anything else you're unsure about?<p class="message sent message-content">I think I'm good for now. Thanks for your help!<p class="message received message-content">You're welcome. Have a great flight and enjoy Melbourne!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=08e28d25-cc03-481d-8fbf-94758486260f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
