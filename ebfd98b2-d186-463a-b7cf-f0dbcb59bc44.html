Are you the owner of the restaurant?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! How can I help you today?<p class=message>Well, I'm a fisherman and I wanted to know if you're interested in buying fresh seafood directly from me.<p class="message sent">Of course! We always love to have fresh seafood on our menu. What do you have to offer?<p class=message>Today I caught some delicious snappers and groupers. They're really fresh and perfect for grilling.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! I'll definitely take some off your hands. How much do you have?<p class=message>I have about 30 pounds of snappers and 20 pounds of groupers. Would that be enough?<p class="message sent">Perfect! That should last us a few days at least. How much are you selling them for?<p class=message>I'm selling them for $10 a pound for the snappers and $15 a pound for the groupers. Is that alright with you?<p class="message sent">Sounds fair to me. I'll take all of it. Can you come back tomorrow with the shipment?<p class=message>Sure thing! I'll be here bright and early. Do you need me to clean and prepare the fish or do you have your own staff for that?<p class="message sent">We have our own staff, but thanks for asking. We'll take care of everything. Thanks for bringing us such fresh seafood!<p class=message>No problem at all. I'll see you tomorrow then!<p class="message sent">Sounds good! Oh, and by the way, if you happen to catch any lobsters or crabs, let me know. We're always in the market for those too.<p class=message>Will do! Thanks for the tip. See you tomorrow!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ebfaff46-0385-417f-aace-5a143c01e4f2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
