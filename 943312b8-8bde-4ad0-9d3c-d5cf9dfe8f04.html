It's quite a challenge trying to map out all the controls and risks to cover.<p class=message>Tell me about it. And we have to ensure we don't miss anything or else we risk failing the audit.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! But let's not forget the importance of maintaining a good sense of humor throughout this process.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. It's always good to break up the seriousness with some light-hearted banter.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Did you hear about the IT guy who got a job as a chef? He was really good at coding spaghetti.<p class=message>(laughs) That's a good one! Here's another: Why did the programmer quit his job? He didn't enjoy going to meetings.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's too real. But let's focus back on the task at hand. How are you approaching the risk assessment process?<p class=message>Well, I'm taking a methodical approach, ensuring I consider all relevant factors and probabilities.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. And don't forget to document everything clearly and succinctly. We don't want the auditors scratching their heads.<p class=message>Absolutely. And with that, I think we've got a good foundation for the audit plan. Let's finalize it and knock it out of the park!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=942f1e26-2b10-4f54-983a-3e765f5658a9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
