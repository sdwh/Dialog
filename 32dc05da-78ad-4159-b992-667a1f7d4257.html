How’s everything looking in the kitchen today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Manager A! Everything is looking great. The prep work for today’s menu is completed and we are ready to go.<p class=message>That’s wonderful to hear. I’ve received some positive feedback from our guests about the food, especially the paella.<p class="message sent">I’m glad to hear that. We take pride in our traditional Spanish dishes here and I make sure to use only the freshest ingredients.<p class=message>Yes, our guests appreciate that attention to detail. By the way, I was thinking of introducing something new to the menu. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">How about a seafood dish with rice? We can use different types of seafood and make it a little spicy to give it a twist.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. I trust your expertise on this, so let’s do it. Speaking of seafood, have you had a chance to try the seafood paella at the restaurant next door?<p class="message sent">Yes, I actually went there last week with some colleagues. It was really good, but I think our paella is still better.<p class=message>(laughs) I like your confidence. We’ll have to make sure to keep it that way. Anyway, we have a full house tonight, so I’ll leave you to it. Keep up the great work!<p class="message sent">Thanks, Manager A! I’ll make sure to deliver the best dishes for our guests tonight.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=32db6370-c44d-457f-82a6-bb43174cb1b8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
