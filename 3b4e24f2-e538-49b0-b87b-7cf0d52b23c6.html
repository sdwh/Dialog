What brings you over to my side of the office today?<p class=message>Well, I heard that you're helping out with the database design for the new e-commerce system our company is building.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. We're using SQL Server for the database and I'm working on the data table design.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. Do you mind if I take a look at it?<p class="message sent">Sure, that'd be great. Let me pull it up on my screen for you.<p class=message>Wow, this table design is really well thought out. I'm impressed!<p class="message sent">Thank you! I've been doing this for quite some time now.<p class=message>Can you explain some of the decisions you made in terms of table relationships?<p class="message sent">Sure. I tried to make sure that each table had a clearly defined relationship with the others to minimize redundancy in the data.<p class=message>That makes sense. And how about the use of primary and foreign keys?<p class="message sent">I made sure that each table had a primary key to uniquely identify each record, and used foreign keys to link related records between tables.<p class=message>That's great. It looks like you've really optimized the structure for efficiency.<p class="message sent">Yes, that was definitely a goal. It should make querying and updating the database much faster.<p class=message>Awesome! I'm really excited to see this new system come to life.<p class="message sent">Me too! And thanks for taking an interest in my work. It's nice to know that people appreciate the effort we put into database design.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3b486847-7c22-4d1f-93d0-0364576f5f23.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
