I see you're the server for tonight. Any advice on which wine would go best with the steak?<p class="message sent">Certainly! We recommend our Chianti Classico Riserva. It has a bold flavor that compliments the steak's rich taste.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. I'll make sure to recommend it to our customers.<p class="message sent">Great! And how would you like your steaks done?<p class=message>Well, I always say medium-rare is the way to go. What about you?<p class="message sent">I'm a vegetarian actually! But I've heard from our regulars that medium is the most popular.<p class=message>Ah, good to know. Speaking of veggies, I noticed we're running low on asparagus. Could you bring me some more from the kitchen?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'll be right back.<p class=message>(to himself) Phew, that was close. Almost had to start singing Kumbaya with the veggie-lovers.<p class="message sent">(returning with the asparagus) Here's your order, sir. By the way, my name is Emily. Nice to meet you!<p class=message>Nice to meet you too, Emily. I'm Adam. Thanks for the asparagus.<p class="message sent">No problem! Enjoy your meal, Adam.<p class=message>(after a while) Wow, this steak is amazing! I think I might have to come back here tomorrow for seconds.<p class="message sent">(laughing) Glad to hear it, Adam. I'll make sure to reserve a table for you.<p class=message>(smiling) Thanks, Emily. You're a lifesaver.<p class="message sent">(jokingly) And you're the grill-master we always rely on.<p class=message>(chuckling) Well, someone's gotta keep the carnivores happy.<p class="message sent">(joining in the laughter) Amen to that.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=408a538a-464a-488a-a58e-694a5bc1aa87.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
