Thanks for joining me today at the baking factory.<p class="message sent">Of course, A. I've been looking forward to trying out these new recipes.<p class=message>Yes, I think we're on to something great here. The combination of flavors in this new cupcake is really something special.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. The aroma alone is enough to make my mouth water.<p class=message>And the texture is just right - not too crumbly, not too dense.<p class="message sent">It's amazing what a difference small adjustments in ingredients can make.<p class=message>That's why I love my job as a food formula developer. It's exciting to experiment and see what can happen.<p class="message sent">And I love being a baker because I get to take those formulas and turn them into something people can enjoy.<p class=message>Exactly. It's truly a collaboration between us.<p class="message sent">Speaking of collaboration, have you ever tried adding lavender to your cupcakes?<p class=message>I haven't, but that's a great idea. I've only really used it in teas before.<p class="message sent">Well, let's give it a shot. I have some dried lavender in my cupboard we can use.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! I love when we can think outside the box and create something unexpected.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's what keeps things interesting in the kitchen.<p class=message>Agreed. And who knows, maybe this new lavender cupcake will be the next big hit!<p class="message sent">Hey, we can dream, right? Let's get started and see what magic we can create.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b2579a6d-d390-4b76-afdd-960d8e24a4e0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
