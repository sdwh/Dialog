Can you assist me?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'd be happy to help. How much does your luggage weigh now?<p class=message>I'm not sure, but I think it might be a bit over the limit. My scale at home is broken, so I couldn't check.<p class="message sent">No problem, we can check it for you. Can you place your luggage on the scale please?<p class=message>Sure thing. *places luggage on scale*<p class="message sent">Hmm, it looks like your luggage is slightly overweight.<p class=message>Oh no, I was afraid of that. Any ideas on how I can lighten the load?<p class="message sent">Well, perhaps you could take out any unnecessary items, or even wear some of your heavier clothing items on the flight.<p class=message>Good idea, I'll try that. Do you have any tips for packing efficiently?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Rolling your clothes instead of folding them can save a lot of space. You can also use packing cubes to keep everything organized.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. You seem to be quite an expert on packing!<p class="message sent">Ha, I suppose I am after working in this job for a while. But I still manage to overpack every once in a while.<p class=message>Yeah, me too. It's so hard to narrow down what to bring!<p class="message sent">That's why it's always a good idea to make a packing list beforehand. It helps you make sure you only bring what you need.<p class=message>I'll definitely give that a try next time. Thanks again for your help and advice!<p class="message sent">No problem at all, have a great flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=501e0ec3-a8da-4ca2-be37-4079b1af0f9e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
