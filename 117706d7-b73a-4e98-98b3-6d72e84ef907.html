Trying to finish this section before lunch.<p class=message>I hear you. So, what do you think about this building we're constructing?<p class="message sent">It's pretty impressive. You architects really know how to design something unique.<p class=message>Thanks, we do try our best. But it's not just us. We need skillful builders like you to make it a reality.<p class="message sent">Well, we appreciate the opportunity to bring your vision to life.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have you had a chance to check out the floor plans for the penthouse yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But if it's anything like the rest of the building, I'm sure it's fantastic.<p class=message>I think you'll like it. It's got an open floor plan with a panoramic view of the city.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing. Maybe I'll have to move in myself!<p class=message>Ha! I'll make sure to save you one.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. So, any plans for the weekend, A?<p class=message>Actually, I'm going to check out a new restaurant that just opened up. Have you heard of it?<p class="message sent">Nope, what's it called?<p class=message>It's called "The Fork and Knife." They specialize in fusion cuisine.<p class="message sent">Hmm, interesting. Let me know how it is. I might have to check it out myself.<p class=message>Sure thing. I'll send you a review once I've tried it out.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. Always looking out for me.<p class=message>That's what colleagues are for!
