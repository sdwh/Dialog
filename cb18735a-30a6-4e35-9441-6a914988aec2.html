Our outdoor pool is a great spot for relaxation and fun. Are you interested in using it during your stay?<p class=message>Yes, definitely! How can I get access to it?<p class="message sent">To use the pool, you will need to get a pool key at the front desk. You can also grab a towel there if you need one.<p class=message>Sounds easy enough. Is there any specific time the pool is open?<p class="message sent">Yes, the pool is open from 9am to 9pm daily. However, we do occasionally close the pool for maintenance or cleaning, so it's always best to check with the front desk first.<p class=message>Good to know. And is there a lifeguard on duty at all times?<p class="message sent">No, we don't have a lifeguard on duty, but we do have security staff around the pool area to help ensure safety.<p class=message>Understood. Are there any pool rules I should be aware of?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a few rules, such as no food or drinks allowed in the pool area and no diving or jumping into the pool. You can find a full list of rules on the sign by the pool.<p class=message>Great, I'll be sure to follow them. Is the pool heated?<p class="message sent">Yes, we keep the pool at a comfortable temperature year-round, so you can enjoy it even in cooler weather.<p class=message>Perfect. One last question, are there any pool toys or floats available?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a selection of pool toys and floats available for guest use. Just ask at the front desk and we'll be happy to provide them for you.<p class=message>Thank you so much for all the information. I can't wait to go for a swim!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Enjoy your time at the pool and let us know if you need anything else during your stay.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cb1107f2-9f5d-475c-a67b-2e057298afea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
