How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm great, thanks for asking. And you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. Have you seen any interesting orders tonight?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. One of our customers ordered the vegan lasagna with extra mushrooms and no cheese.<p class=message>Ah, sounds interesting. I'll make sure to prepare it just how they like it.<p class="message sent">That's great. And don't forget to sprinkle some vegan Parmesan on top.<p class=message>Will do! So, what are your plans for the rest of the evening?<p class="message sent">Well, after my shift ends, I plan on catching a movie with some friends. How about you?<p class=message>I might hit up a nearby pub and catch a game. But first, I need to make sure all of our customers are happy.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, customer satisfaction is key. Speaking of which, did you hear about the customer who tried to order a well-done salmon?<p class=message>(laughs) Oh no, you're kidding! What did you say to them?<p class="message sent">I politely informed them that well-done salmon wouldn't be as flavorful and suggested they try it cooked medium instead.<p class=message>Good thinking! I always appreciate when our staff goes the extra mile to ensure our customers have the best experience.<p class="message sent">Thanks! It's all about providing great service.<p class=message>Couldn't agree more. Alright, I should get back to the kitchen. Got a lot of orders to prepare!<p class="message sent">Yes, and I should check on the tables. See you later, A!<p class=message>Have a great evening, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=92bf4d2f-1edb-41b0-9b8b-446a0a1ce694.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
