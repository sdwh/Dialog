How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm planning a trip to San Francisco with my family, and I was wondering if you could help me with some recommendations for things to do.<p class=message>Absolutely! San Francisco is a great destination. How long are you planning on staying?<p class="message sent">We have about a week to spend there.<p class=message>That's perfect! There are so many things to do and see in the city. Have you ever been to Alcatraz?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it worth visiting?<p class=message>Yes, definitely! It's a must-see attraction in San Francisco. You can take a ferry over to the island and get a tour of the prison.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds exciting! What else would you recommend?<p class=message>Well, the Golden Gate Bridge is another famous landmark in San Francisco. You can rent a bike and ride across it or take a scenic hike in the nearby Golden Gate Park.<p class="message sent">That sounds lovely. Are there any other outdoor activities we could do?<p class=message>If you're up for an adventure, you could take a boat tour of the bay and see the city skyline from the water. Or you could visit Fisherman's Wharf and try some fresh seafood.<p class="message sent">Those are great ideas! Is there anything else we shouldn't miss while we're there?<p class=message>You could take a cable car ride up to the top of Lombard Street, one of the crookedest streets in the world. And of course, you'll want to indulge in some delicious San Francisco sourdough bread.<p class="message sent">Perfect, thanks for all the recommendations. I think we'll have plenty to keep us busy!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8a6e0298-5815-4e36-96c4-5f851da0dd47.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
