So, how do they differ?<p class=message>ISO 27001 is a standard for organizations to implement a framework to manage their information security risks, while GDPR and CCPA are laws that regulate how personal data needs to be protected.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. So, are companies required to comply with both?<p class=message>Yes, companies that handle personal data must comply with GDPR if they process data of EU citizens and CCPA if they process data of California residents. ISO 27001 is not a mandatory requirement but it's a good practice for organizations to help ensure they handle personal data securely.<p class="message sent">I see. So, what kind of security measures are required for GDPR and CCPA compliance?<p class=message>They include technical and organizational measures like encryption, access controls, risk assessments, and privacy policies.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like a lot of work. Have you worked on GDPR or CCPA compliance before?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad.<p class="message sent">Good to know. I might have to start looking into these regulations soon.<p class=message>Yeah, it's always best to stay informed and proactive about privacy regulations. Plus, it can save you from some serious headaches down the road.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8c066601-c62e-4dff-976a-93aa3bd00131.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
