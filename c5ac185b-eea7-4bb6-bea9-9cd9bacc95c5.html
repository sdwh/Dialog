How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing pretty well, A. I'm just a bit stressed out about this audit.<p class=message>Don't worry, B. We'll get through it together. So, let's dive right into the financial statements.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's start with the balance sheet. I think we might have a bit of a discrepancy with the inventory account.<p class=message>Ah yes, I see what you mean. But don't worry, we'll get that sorted out. On a lighter note, have you heard any good jokes lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, I did hear a funny one. Why did the tomato turn red?<p class=message>I don't know, why?<p class="message sent">Because it saw the salad dressing!<p class=message>Hahaha, that's a good one. Speaking of food, have you tried the new taco truck that just opened up down the street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class=message>It's fantastic! You should definitely try it out. But back to business, let's move on to the income statement.<p class="message sent">Right, let's see... Oh, I think we need to make some adjustments to the depreciation expense.<p class=message>Okay, we can make that change. While we're on the topic of adjusting, have you ever tried yoga or meditation to relieve stress?<p class="message sent">I haven't, but I've heard it can be really helpful. Have you tried it?<p class=message>Yes, I practice yoga twice a week and it really helps me stay relaxed and focused. Okay, let's finish up with the cash flow statement.<p class="message sent">Great. I think everything looks good here, I don't see any issues.<p class=message>Excellent. Well, that's a wrap for today. Thanks for coming in and working with me, B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. And thanks for the recommendation on the taco truck, I'll give it a try!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5abd390-d045-417d-a69f-4cc44964494c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
