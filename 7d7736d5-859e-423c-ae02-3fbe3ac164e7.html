How are you all doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How about you, Professor?<p class=message>I'm doing great! So, last class we talked about different economic theories. Did you all have a chance to review them?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! I found it very interesting to compare and contrast the different theories.<p class=message>That's good to hear! Today, we're going to delve deeper into the history of economic thought.<p class="message sent">Oh wow! I'm excited to learn more about this.<p class=message>Yes, it's fascinating to learn about how various ideas have shaped the field of economics. Who has a favorite economic theory so far?<p class="message sent">I really enjoyed reading about Keynesian economics. How about you, Professor?<p class=message>I've always been fascinated by Marxist economics, and its emphasis on social justice.<p class="message sent">That's very interesting! Do you think Marxist economics will ever gain mainstream popularity?<p class=message>It's hard to say, but I think there is always room for alternative economic theories. Plus, it's always good to have a range of perspectives in any field.<p class="message sent">That's very true. Hey, do you have any fun plans for the weekend?<p class=message>Actually, yes. I'm planning to go on a hike with some friends. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm planning on spending some quality time with my family. Maybe we'll have a BBQ!<p class=message>That sounds absolutely delightful!
