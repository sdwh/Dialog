It's a security standard for information technology.<p class=message>Exactly, but do you know how important it is to have a strong firewall?<p class="message sent">Of course, it's like the first line of defense against cyber attacks.<p class=message>Right you are. Did you know that many companies neglect this aspect and end up getting hacked?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's crazy to think that something so basic could bring down an entire company.<p class=message>That's why we should encourage more businesses to implement ISO 27001 standards.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It not only protects against hacks, but it also builds trust with customers.<p class=message>Absolutely. It shows that a company cares about keeping their customers' data safe.<p class="message sent">So true. And having a strong firewall also limits the effects of any breaches that could happen.<p class=message>The last thing anyone wants is to have their sensitive data stolen or compromised.<p class="message sent">It's a scary thought, for sure. But it's also reassuring to know that standards like ISO 27001 exist.<p class=message>Right, and to make things easier, there are tools available that help with implementing these standards.<p class="message sent">Yeah, like automated scans and alerts. These can help companies stay up-to-date with their security measures.<p class=message>And the best part is that it saves time and resources in the long run.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's much better to be proactive with security measures than reactive after a breach happens.<p class=message>Couldn't have said it better myself. So, let's encourage others to take cybersecurity seriously and implement measures like ISO 27001 Firewall.<p class="message sent">Agreed, let's spread the word and help protect businesses from potential hacks.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cd95c730-149c-4c0b-9f32-0a835da3dbb8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
