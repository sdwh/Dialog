How about you?<p class="message received message-content">Can't complain. So, let's talk about software testing. What's the most important thing we need to ensure?<p class="message sent message-content">Well, I'd say stability and security are both pretty high up there.<p class="message received message-content">Agreed. How do you usually go about testing for those things?<p class="message sent message-content">We have a series of automated tests that we run, as well as some manual testing from our QA team.<p class="message received message-content">Nice. Do you ever run into any funny bugs during testing?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh yeah, all the time. We had one recently where the checkout process would freeze if you tried to buy more than 100 items.<p class="message received message-content">Ha, that's hilarious. Anything else unusual come up lately?<p class="message sent message-content">Actually, one of our beta testers reported a bug where the website displayed everything in Comic Sans font.<p class="message received message-content">Oh man, that's great. How did you fix it?<p class="message sent message-content">We just had to go in and update the font settings in the CSS files. It's amazing how much of a difference small details like that can make for user experience.<p class="message received message-content">Definitely. It's cool how a lot of the work we do behind the scenes can have a big impact on the overall success of the company.<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, it can be tough, but it's always rewarding to see the finished product perform well.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=035c4d53-f6d2-48d4-a538-7dd88449bc82.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
