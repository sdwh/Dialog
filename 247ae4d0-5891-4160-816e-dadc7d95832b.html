Are you ready for your flight today?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm excited to go to New York!<p class=message>Great! Before we take off, we need to go through a quick safety check. Do you have any prohibited items in your carry-on luggage?<p class="message sent">No, I think everything is okay. But what counts as a prohibited item?<p class=message>Anything sharp, like knives or scissors, aerosol cans, and liquids over 100ml. It's important to keep everyone on board safe!<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll make sure to double-check my bag. Do I need to take off my shoes during the security check?<p class=message>Yes, sir. It's for everyone's safety, so please take off anything metal or bulky before going through the metal detector.<p class="message sent">Got it, I'll be sure to wear easy-to-remove shoes. How about laptops and tablets?<p class=message>Those will need to come out of your bag and go through the X-ray separately as well. And don't forget to remove your belt and everything in your pockets.<p class="message sent">Thanks for reminding me. How long does the security check usually take?<p class=message>It can vary depending on how many people are in line, but we recommend arriving at least two hours before your flight. That way you won't feel rushed.<p class="message sent">I see. Thanks for the advice, and thanks for keeping us safe in the air!<p class=message>Of course! It's my pleasure to fly you to your destination. Have a great flight, sir!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=247a5a82-4440-4e67-81b7-7cb36ba7b70c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
