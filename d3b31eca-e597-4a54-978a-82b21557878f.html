Just dealing with some server issues at the moment. How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm doing alright. Just wanted to check in on the progress of our ISO 27001 audit.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, we're chugging along. Had a few hiccups, but nothing major. Just a couple of vulnerabilities we need to patch up.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Say, have you heard about the new ISO 27007 standard?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it about?<p class=message>It's all about auditing management systems. I think it could be a game changer for our industry.<p class="message sent">Huh, sounds interesting. I'll definitely have to check it out. Speaking of games, have you played any good ones lately?<p class=message>Funny you should ask. I recently got into a new mobile game called "Among Us." It's all about deception and trying to figure out who the impostor is.<p class="message sent">Oh man, I've heard so many good things about that one. Maybe we should start a company-wide tournament.<p class=message>Count me in! But let's be sure to keep it secure, or else I might have to come do an audit on our game servers.<p class="message sent">Ha, fair enough. Security always comes first. But for now, let's enjoy our downtime and get some gaming in.<p class=message>Agreed. Cheers to fun and security, my friend.<p class="message sent">Cheers indeed.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d3af0c04-f061-4091-8a5b-5ee556b1eb0d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
