Let's start with some basic stretches to get warmed up.<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds good.<p class=message>Alright, now let's get you on the board. Remember to keep your chest up and gaze forward.<p class="message sent">Got it. This is harder than I thought.<p class=message>It takes some practice, but you'll get the hang of it. With a little determination and balance, you'll be surfing in no time.<p class="message sent">I hope so, I've always wanted to try it.<p class=message>That's the spirit! Now, let's paddle out and catch some waves.<p class="message sent">Wait, what about sharks?<p class=message>Don't worry, we're in the shark-free zone. Plus, they're more afraid of us than we are of them.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's do this!<p class=message>Great job, see how you rode that wave all the way in? You're a natural.<p class="message sent">Wow, that was amazing! I can't wait to do it again.<p class=message>I knew you'd love it. Surfing is addicting, and before you know it, you'll be a pro.<p class="message sent">Thanks for being such a great teacher, I couldn't have asked for a better first lesson.<p class=message>No problem! Let's catch a few more waves before the lesson is over. Who knows, you might just become the next surfing champion.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eabf04a1-1b52-47e0-9f4a-9ceaaf444004.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
