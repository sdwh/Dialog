Just trying to figure out the best way to ensure our software is both stable and secure.<p class=message>Yeah, that's definitely a priority. Have you thought about using automated testing?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Automated testing is a huge help, but we also need to make sure we have manual testing to catch any potential issues.<p class=message>Good point. And we should definitely make sure we have a diverse team of testers to catch any user experience issues as well.<p class="message sent">Right. And we need to make sure we're testing in different environments to catch any compatibility issues.<p class=message>Definitely. And what about specific security testing? Have we talked to any ethical hackers to try and find vulnerabilities?<p class="message sent">Great idea. We also need to make sure to encrypt any sensitive data and test for any potential breaches.<p class=message>Agreed. And we should have regular reviews and tests on the software to catch any issues that may arise in the future.<p class="message sent">Right, we need to make sure we're constantly testing and improving our software. And if we do find any issues, we need to make sure we're transparent and honest with our customers.<p class=message>Absolutely. Honesty is always the best policy, especially when it comes to something as important as software security and stability.<p class="message sent">Alright, I think we've got a solid plan moving forward. Let's get to work and make sure our software is the best it can be!<p class=message>Agreed.
