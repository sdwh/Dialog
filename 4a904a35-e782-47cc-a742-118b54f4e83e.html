The lava flowing down the mountain is mesmerizing.<p class="message sent">Yes, and the heat is intense.

That's why we're reminding visitors to stay at a safe distance.<p class="message sent">Yes, safety first for sure. I can't wait to tell my friends about this experience.<p class=message>I'm sure they'll be envious! Is there anything else you want to see while you're here?<p class="message sent">Definitely!
