Thank you for coming to the station to answer some questions. Can I offer you a cup of coffee?<p class="message sent">No thanks, I'm good for now.<p class=message>Alright. Let's start with some basic questions. What were you doing last night around 9 pm?<p class="message sent">Oh, nothing much. Just going for a walk.<p class=message>A walk? In a secluded alley where there have been reports of stolen goods?<p class="message sent">No, I swear I wasn't in that area. I was just walking near the park.<p class=message>Really? Are you sure about that? Because we have eyewitnesses who claim to have seen you running away from the scene with a bag.<p class="message sent">(pauses) Okay fine, you got me. But in my defense, I really needed the money.<p class=message>(sighs) You know stealing is still a crime, right? But I'm glad you finally admitted to it. It'll be easier for us to resolve this matter.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. So, what happens now?<p class=message>Well, you'll be charged with theft and we'll have to bring you to court. But if you cooperate with us and give us any information that can help solve other cases, we might be more lenient.<p class="message sent">Sure, I understand. Can you at least tell me one thing? How did you catch me so fast?<p class=message>(smirks) Let's just say we have our ways. Anything else you want to share with us?<p class="message sent">(shakes head) No, that's all. Can I go now?<p class=message>Yes, but you'll have to come back here soon for the court hearing. And don't even think about running away.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Don't worry, I won't. Thanks for being cool about this.<p class=message>(smiles) No problem. Just doing my job. Have a good day, Mr. B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b6f42ec6-0dac-4da4-95cb-131aca45584d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
