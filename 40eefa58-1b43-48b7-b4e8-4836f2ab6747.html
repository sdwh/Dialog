It's all about keeping our company's information safe and secure, right?<p class=message>That's right. ISO 27001 is the international standard for information security management systems.<p class="message sent">Sounds complicated. But I guess it's important to protect our data from potential threats.<p class=message>Definitely. We don't want any loopholes for hackers to get into our system!<p class="message sent">Speaking of loopholes, have you seen that movie "Ocean's Eleven" where they break into a casino?<p class=message>Oh yeah! That's a classic heist movie. But I don't think we should take that as a security guidebook for our company.<p class="message sent">Haha, good point. We need to be serious about ISO 27001 and follow the proper procedures.<p class=message>Absolutely. Luckily, we have a team dedicated to ensuring our company's compliance with ISO 27001.<p class="message sent">That's great. I feel better knowing that our data is in good hands.<p class=message>It's always better to be safe than sorry, right?<p class="message sent">Totally. And now, let's switch gears and talk about something fun. Any plans for the weekend?<p class=message>Actually, I was thinking of going to the beach. What about you?<p class="message sent">Nice! I was planning on trying out a new restaurant in town. Let's catch up on Monday and share our weekend adventures.<p class=message>Deal! But first, let's finish our lunch. I'm starving!<p class="message sent">Same here. Pass me the salt, please.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=40eaee6c-56a0-4598-91f1-d67e49970b9a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
