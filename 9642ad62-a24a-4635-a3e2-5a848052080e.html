Why is integrity specifically important?<p class=message>Integrity ensures that data is accurate, complete, and trustworthy. It's like making sure the information hasn't been tampered with.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So how does it work?<p class=message>There are a bunch of controls put in place to prevent unauthorized changes to information.<p class="message sent">Like what kind of controls?<p class=message>Anything from access controls to ensure only authorized individuals can make changes, to audit trails to monitor changes and detect any unauthorized activity.<p class="message sent">Interesting! So it's kind of like a lock and key system for information?<p class=message>Yup, exactly!<p class="message sent">I can definitely see why this would be useful in any organization.<p class=message>Absolutely! Especially with the increasing amount of sensitive information being stored digitally now.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. Have you ever worked with an organization implementing this standard?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It was definitely a challenging but rewarding experience.<p class="message sent">What was the most challenging aspect?<p class=message>Probably ensuring that all employees were trained and aware of the standard and their responsibilities in maintaining information integrity.<p class="message sent">Ah, I can imagine that would be a lot of work.<p class=message>Definitely, but worth it in the end for the peace of mind and security of information.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=964000cb-b672-4309-8059-695a6a43aa93.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
