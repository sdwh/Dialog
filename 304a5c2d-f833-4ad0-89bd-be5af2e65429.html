Are you excited to drive us to Gold Coast?<p class="message sent">Good morning, yes I am! Have you been to Gold Coast before?<p class=message>No, it's my first time. Do you have any recommendations for places to visit?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out Surfers Paradise for some beach time and shopping. And maybe take a trip to the Gold Coast Theme Park for some fun rides.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds exciting! I hope I don't get too scared on those rides.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, they're not too scary. Just hold on tight! Have you got sunscreen and a hat?<p class=message>Yes, I packed them in my bag. I heard the sun can be pretty intense over there.<p class="message sent">That's right. You don't want to get a sunburn on your first day! So, what brings you to Gold Coast?<p class=message>Just a vacation with some friends. We wanted to try something new and adventurous.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great plan. Make sure to try some local seafood too. The fish and chips here are delicious.<p class=message>I will definitely give them a try, thanks for the recommendation! How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for about 10 years now. It's a fun job, I get to meet new people every day.<p class=message>That's great. Do you have any interesting stories to share?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. Well, one time I drove a group of tourists to the airport and they forgot one of their suitcases in my car. I had to drive back and return it.<p class=message>Oh no! I'm glad you were able to return it to them. You must have made their day.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's moments like those that make my job worthwhile.<p class=message>Well, it looks like we're almost at our destination. Thanks for the great conversation and safe driving!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, enjoy your trip and have fun!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=304a2978-e5e9-4299-b8a2-29080ee435aa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
