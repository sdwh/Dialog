Any ideas on what it could be?<p class="message sent">I'm thinking it might be a clogged filter. I'm going to take a look and see.<p class=message>Good idea. While you do that, I'll go grab some maintenance tools from the supply closet.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Hey, did you hear that the company is bringing in a ping pong table for the break room?<p class=message>Really? That's awesome! We need something to break up the monotony around here.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm already practicing my serves. I'm going to be the office ping pong champ!<p class=message>Haha, we'll see about that. By the way, have you tried the new coffee machine in the break room? It's actually pretty decent.<p class="message sent">No way, I haven't had a chance to try it yet. I've been so busy with this equipment maintenance.<p class=message>Well, let's take a coffee break after we finish up here. On me.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Thanks!<p class=message>No problem. It's important to take breaks and recharge, especially when we're knee-deep in equipment repairs.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And who knows, maybe we'll come up with a solution to that glitch over a cup of joe.<p class=message>Hey, stranger things have happened. *laughs*<p class="message sent">*laughs* You never know. Alright, let me get back to this filter. I'll let you know what I find.<p class=message>Alright, I'll gather the tools and meet you back here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1e787e59-2786-4950-b386-f584aa934013.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
