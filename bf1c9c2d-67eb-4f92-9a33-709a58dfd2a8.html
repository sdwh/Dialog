What can I do for you?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I received a notice from my neighbor that they're planning to build a fence that would block my driveway. Can you help me with this?<p class=message>Of course. Let's see, do you have a copy of the letter?<p class="message sent">Yes, here it is.<p class=message>Alright, I see. First, we need to check the property lines to make sure they're not overstepping. Then, we'll look at the local ordinance for any zoning laws and restrictions.<p class="message sent">That sounds complicated.<p class=message>It can be, but don't worry, we'll take care of everything. But, don't you think it's ironic that we need to hire a lawyer to solve a dispute about fences?<p class="message sent">Definitely! It's like we're living in a sitcom.<p class=message>Haha, well at least we're not alone. I have clients who have argued over the color of their shared fence.<p class="message sent">Really?<p class=message>Yes, they couldn't agree if it should be beige or white. It might seem trivial, but it's amazing how far people can go for something so small.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. I hope we don't end up like that.<p class=message>Don't worry, we won't. We'll settle this fence issue and get back to the important things in life.<p class="message sent">Thanks a lot, A. You've been really helpful.<p class=message>No problem. Let's get started on this and see what we can do.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bf1c4a98-a365-4be7-b9b8-6a3c4e939193.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
