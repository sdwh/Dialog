Welcome back to our office. It's great to see you again.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Architect A. Thanks for meeting with me today. I'm excited to see the progress on the design.<p class=message>Yes, we've made quite a bit of progress since our last meeting. Let's take a look at the latest blueprints.<p class="message sent">Wow, these look fantastic! I love the open concept design and the natural lighting.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that you're satisfied with it. We've also added a few eco-friendly features to make the building more sustainable.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Sustainability is important to me. Can you tell me more about those features?<p class=message>We've installed solar panels on the roof, incorporated a rainwater harvesting system, and used energy-efficient materials for the insulation.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. I'm definitely on board with those additions. How's the budget looking?<p class=message>We're on track with the estimated budget. The cost of the eco-friendly features may be a bit higher, but they will save you money in the long run.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I want to make sure we're being responsible with our resources. What's the timeline looking like?<p class=message>We're still on track for completion in about a year, but we'll have a more accurate timeline once construction begins.<p class="message sent">Alright, sounds good. Thanks for keeping me in the loop, Architect A.<p class=message>No problem at all, Mr. B. We're always here to answer any questions you may have. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I was thinking about adding a rooftop garden. Do you think that's doable?<p class=message>Absolutely! It's a great idea and we can easily incorporate it into the design. Let's add that to the blueprints.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic. Thank you, Architect A. You've been a great help.<p class=message>It's my pleasure, Mr. B. We're always here to make your vision a reality.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=48b75eee-1c48-41e3-8078-15110839a659.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
