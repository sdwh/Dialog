How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing okay, just a little nervous about our legal situation. But I know I'm in good hands with you, A.<p class=message>Don't worry, B. We'll get through this together. Now, what can I do for you?<p class="message sent">Well, I need some advice on how to handle my recent arrest for jaywalking. I know it may seem minor, but I don't want it to affect my record.<p class=message>(laughing) Jaywalking, really? I thought you were more of a rule-follower, B.<p class="message sent">(laughing) I know, I know. But you know how it is. Sometimes you're in a hurry and you just cross when you shouldn't.<p class=message>(smiling) I understand. Let me take a look at your case and we'll see what we can do.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, A. I really appreciate it.<p class=message>Of course, that's what I'm here for. So, have you been keeping up with the latest legal dramas on TV?<p class="message sent">(laughing) Actually, I have. It's funny how they always make lawyers look so slick and cool.<p class=message>I know, right? If only we could be that glamorous in real life.<p class="message sent">(laughing) Well, you always look pretty cool to me, A.<p class=message>(smiling) Aw, thanks B. You're making me blush.<p class="message sent">(laughing) So, what kind of lawyer quirks do you have? Do you have a favorite legal phrase that you like to use?<p class=message>(laughing) Hmm, well I do tend to say "objection!" a lot but that's more for dramatic effect.<p class="message sent">(laughing) I can imagine you doing that in court. So, what's the most interesting case you've ever worked on?<p class=message>(thinking) You know, I once had a client who claimed they were being haunted by a ghost. We had to prove that the ghost was not real in order to win the case.<p class="message sent">(laughing) That's crazy! Did you win?<p class=message>(laughing) Yes, we did. We were able to prove that there was no evidence of a ghost and it was all in their head.<p class="message sent">(laughing) Well, you're not just a good lawyer, but also a ghost debunker. Thanks for everything, A.<p class=message>(smiling) Anytime, B. Let's get to work on that jaywalking case now.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c63ac5e8-a7a1-4875-a62f-ca145bfa0f8e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
