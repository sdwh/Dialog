He's been keeping all the machines running smoothly.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. I wonder how he does it.<p class=message>I don't know, maybe he has some magical tricks up his sleeve. Or maybe he just knows how to talk to the machines.<p class="message sent">Haha, maybe he does! Seriously though, it takes some serious skill to do what he does.<p class=message>Definitely. I tried to do some maintenance on one of the machines once, and I ended up making things worse.<p class="message sent">Oh no, did you break it?<p class=message>It wasn't working properly before, but after I touched it, it stopped working altogether!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well, at least you know your limits.<p class=message>Yeah, I'll leave the maintenance to the professionals like our engineer. Speaking of which, do you know if he's going to be working on the line today?<p class="message sent">I'm not sure, but we can go check with him. Maybe he'll show us a thing or two about how to maintain the machines.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Let's go find him and see what tricks he has up his sleeve.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3dbf7477-8b03-4995-8363-6ebee0036cd7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
