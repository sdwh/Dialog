My name is John, and I'll be your driver today. How are you feeling?<p class="message sent">Hi John, I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I'm excited to see the bridge and enjoy the scenery.<p class=message>Great! I promise you won't be disappointed. This is one of the most iconic bridges in the world.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've heard a lot about it. How long does it take to cross the bridge?<p class=message>It's about 1.7 miles long, so it takes around 10 minutes to cross, depending on traffic.<p class="message sent">That's not too bad. Is there anything we should know before we start?<p class=message>Yes, definitely. This is a two-way bridge, so we'll be driving on the right side. And make sure to take some amazing photos!<p class="message sent">Sounds good. I'm always on the lookout for a good photo opportunity.<p class=message>You'll definitely get some great shots of San Francisco Bay from up here.<p class="message sent">I can see that! The view is incredible. Oh, quick question, have you ever seen the famous fog that San Francisco is known for?<p class=message>Oh, yes! It can be quite heavy sometimes, which can make driving a bit tricky. But even then, it's still a sight to see.<p class="message sent">I bet! I'll have to come back and see that for myself. Do you ever get tired of driving over the bridge?<p class=message>Not at all! It never gets old. There's always something new to see, and I love the feeling of being high up over the water.<p class="message sent">I can see why. This is such an impressive structure. Thanks for showing me around.<p class=message>You're welcome! It's been a pleasure. If you have any other questions, just let me know.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=43f09247-a124-4ad5-8a44-68b417de5624.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
