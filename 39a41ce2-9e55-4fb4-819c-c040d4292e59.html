How's business?<p class="message sent">Pretty good! Can't complain. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. There's something about the smell of freshly cooked chicken in the morning that just gets people going, you know?<p class="message sent">Ha! Yeah, I know what you mean. I love the smell of freshly ground soybeans in the morning myself.<p class=message>How do you come up with your recipe for your soy milk?<p class="message sent">It's actually a family recipe that's been passed down for generations. We use only the freshest soybeans and water, and no preservatives.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. I'll have to try some.<p class="message sent">You definitely should! And I'll have to try your chicken rice too. It looks delicious.<p class=message>Thank you! Our secret is in the special sauce we use.<p class="message sent">I'm sure it's top secret, huh?<p class=message>Ha! You know it. But all that matters is that our customers love it.<p class="message sent">Speaking of customers, I've noticed some people coming to your stall for breakfast and then coming over to mine for a drink.<p class=message>That's great to hear! We make a good pair.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we do. We should do some cross-promotion or something.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We could have a "breakfast package" deal where they get chicken rice and soy milk together.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And we can call it "The Perfect Breakfast Combo".<p class=message>I like it! Let's get started on that right away.<p class="message sent">You got it! It's a pleasure doing business with you, A.<p class=message>Likewise, B. Let's keep serving up delicious food and drinks to our customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=39a3551b-73ff-4fd6-b693-3815d700e540.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
