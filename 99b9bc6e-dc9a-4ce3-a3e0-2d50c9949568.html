Working hard as always, but it's worth it when I see our customers enjoying our food and drinks.<p class=message>Absolutely! Speaking of which, have you tried the new sashimi platter we just added to the menu?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard great things. What's your favorite sushi roll that we make?<p class=message>Hmm, that's tough. I really love the spider roll, but the dragon roll is a close second.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, those are both amazing. Have you tried the uni yet?<p class=message>Yes I have! I was a little hesitant to try it because of the texture, but it was surprisingly delicious.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Our customers love it as well. How about a sake recommendation to pair with your favorite roll?<p class=message>Ooh, that sounds good. I've heard the Dewazakura sake is great with sushi. Have you tried it?<p class="message sent">Yes I have! It's definitely one of our more popular sakes. If you're feeling adventurous, the Nigori sake has a really unique, creamy texture that pairs well with spicy rolls.<p class=message>Wow, I'll have to try that next time. You really know your stuff! Thanks, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. We're all about providing the best experience for our customers. Plus, it's always fun to learn about new foods and drinks.<p class=message>Agreed! It's one of my favorite parts of working here. Speaking of fun, have you tried making any of the new sushi rolls we added to the menu?<p class="message sent">Yes, the Rainbow Roll and the Crazy Crunch Roll are both really fun to make. They're also really popular with our customers.<p class=message>Awesome! I'd love to learn how to make them sometime.<p class="message sent">Of course, I'd be happy to show you. It takes practice, but it's really satisfying when you get it just right.<p class=message>I can't wait! Thanks for being such a great teacher, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. We're all here to support each other and make sure our customers have the best experience possible.<p class=message>Definitely! It's one big happy family here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99b99c85-36b2-48f2-b924-c6954baf0b91.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
