Is there a hairdryer in the room?<p class="message sent">Yes, there is a hairdryer in the bathroom. I actually used it this morning, and it worked great.<p class=message>Awesome, thank you for letting me know. And what about the shower? Is it a regular showerhead or a rain shower?<p class="message sent">It's a regular showerhead, but the water pressure is fantastic. You'll definitely be able to get a good, refreshing shower.<p class=message>That's exactly what I was hoping for. How about the toiletries? Are they standard or more upscale?<p class="message sent">They're definitely on the more upscale side. The shampoo and conditioner are from a well-known brand, and there's even a bathrobe and slippers provided.<p class=message>Impressive! And what about towels? Do they provide enough for two people or just one?<p class="message sent">They provide enough for two people plus extra towels in case you need them. You won't have to worry about running out.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I always appreciate having enough towels. One last question, is there a bathtub in the room as well?<p class="message sent">No, there's no bathtub, but there is a really nice heated towel rack to warm up your towels while you're showering.<p class=message>Okay, that sounds great. Thanks for your help. I can't wait to settle in and enjoy the amenities.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, I hope you have a fantastic stay!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ef573554-4dff-4076-a2f9-481479217b50.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
