How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well too, thank you for asking. So, today's class is going to be a bit different.<p class="message sent">Oh, really? How so?<p class=message>Well, instead of talking about economics, let's share some fun facts about ourselves. Who wants to start?<p class="message sent">I'll go first! Did you know that I used to be a competitive swimmer?<p class=message>That's interesting! Did you ever win any competitions?<p class="message sent">Yes, I won a few, but I mostly did it for fun and for the exercise.<p class=message>That's great. Alright, here's a fun fact about myself- I used to be in a band when I was in college.<p class="message sent">Really? What kind of music did you guys play?<p class=message>We played a mix of rock and jazz, it was a lot of fun.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! Do you still play any instruments?<p class=message>Every now and then. I have a guitar at home that I like to play around with.<p class="message sent">That's really cool. Thanks for sharing that with us, Professor A.<p class=message>Of course, it's always nice to get to know each other outside of the classroom. Alright, let's get started on today's lesson, shall we?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fb02e80a-f412-4874-9fc4-d02a413abba4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
