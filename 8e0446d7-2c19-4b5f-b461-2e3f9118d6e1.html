What brings you to Nanjing?<p class=message>I'm here on vacation. I've always been fascinated by Chinese culture, so I'm excited to explore the city.<p class="message sent">It's a great city. Have you tried any local food yet?<p class=message>Yes, I had some delicious dumplings last night. What's your favorite local dish?<p class="message sent">Oh, I definitely have to go with the Nanjing salted duck. It's one of our specialties.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. I might have to give it a try. So, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving a taxi for 10 years now. It's a tough job, but I enjoy meeting new people from all over the world.<p class=message>That's cool. Do you ever get lost?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Sometimes, but I always find my way back. Plus, having a GPS definitely helps.<p class=message>Yeah, technology is amazing. Speaking of which, what kind of music do you like to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of classic rock. The Beatles and Rolling Stones are my favorites.<p class=message>Nice, I love classic rock too. Have you been to any concerts lately?<p class="message sent">I actually went to see a Guns N' Roses tribute band last weekend. They were pretty good.<p class=message>(laughs) That sounds like fun. You seem like a fun guy to hang out with.<p class="message sent">(smiles) Thank you, I try my best. We're almost at your destination, is there anything else you need help with?<p class=message>No, that's it. Thank you for the great conversation and safe driving.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, enjoy the rest of your trip in Nanjing!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8dff1405-4e0b-490f-8fb7-3dfcda415241.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
