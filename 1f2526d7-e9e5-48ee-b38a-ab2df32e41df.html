We're supposed to test the new feature on the app, right?<p class=message>Exactly! And we need to make sure we achieve full test coverage. It's quite a challenge, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but we can definitely pull it off. What kind of approach are we using for this?<p class=message>We're planning to use a combination of automated and manual testing. What do you think about it?<p class="message sent">It sounds like a solid plan. We could also try exploratory testing to make sure we don't miss anything.<p class=message>Good point. And we should also prioritize our tests based on the criticality of the feature.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We can use risk analysis to identify the most crucial areas and start testing from there.<p class=message>That's a great idea. We should also make sure our test data is comprehensive and covers various scenarios.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We don't want to miss any edge cases that could lead to bugs.<p class=message>We should also perform regression testing to make sure any changes to the code don't break the existing functionality.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's important too. We should automate that as much as possible to save time.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we should keep track of all the defects we find and prioritize fixing them based on their severity.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. We don't want to leave any critical bugs unfixed.<p class=message>I think we've covered everything. Let's get started and make sure we achieve comprehensive test coverage!<p class="message sent">Yeah, let's do it! It's going to be a busy but exciting time for us.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f23bc43-603c-4a90-b680-68108eab373f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
