How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thanks. So, what brings you to the administrative office today?<p class="message sent">Well, I wanted to discuss some student affairs with you. Specifically about the upcoming student orientation.<p class=message>Ah, yes. I've been working on that with my team. What do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of incorporating some team-building activities for the new students. Maybe a scavenger hunt or a group problem-solving session.<p class=message>Those are great ideas. We could also have some icebreaker activities to help them get to know each other.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a good point. We want to ensure that they feel comfortable and included from the start.<p class=message>Absolutely. Another thing to keep in mind is scheduling. We want to make sure that the activities are spread out over the orientation period, so the students don't feel overwhelmed.<p class="message sent">Yes, I agree. We could have some activities in the morning and others in the afternoon, with breaks in between.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. We can also provide some snacks and drinks for the students during the breaks.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. It's important to keep them energized and hydrated.<p class=message>Definitely. And we can have some staff members available throughout the orientation period to answer any questions or concerns the students may have.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's important, especially for international students who may not be familiar with the campus or the culture.<p class=message>Absolutely. Well, it sounds like we have a solid plan in place. Thank you for your input, Professor B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. I'm glad we could work together on this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bf10eacb-438a-4d05-9c56-3aa0becc6c8f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
