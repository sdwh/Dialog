It's like a Korean wrap!<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's in it?<p class=message>Well, you take a lettuce or cabbage leaf, and you fill it with rice, meat, and vegetables. Then you wrap it up and eat it like a taco.<p class="message sent">That sounds fascinating! I love trying out new foods. Where can we get some Ssam around here?<p class=message>There's a Korean restaurant a few blocks from here. Shall we check it out?<p class="message sent">Sure, sounds good! What filling do you recommend?<p class=message>I always go for bulgogi, which is a sweet and savory marinated beef. But they also have pork belly, tofu, and seafood options.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'll try the pork belly. I heard it's really juicy and flavorful.<p class=message>Great choice! And don't forget to add some gochujang sauce for some extra kick. It's a spicy red pepper paste that goes well with everything.<p class="message sent">I'm definitely adding that. Do you know any good sides to go with Ssam?<p class=message>Oh, there are so many! I'd highly recommend kimchi, which is a spicy fermented cabbage. You can also try some japchae, which is a stir-fried glass noodle dish.<p class="message sent">Wow, my mouth is watering already! When can we go to that Korean restaurant?<p class=message>How about tomorrow for lunch? I'll make a reservation and we can indulge in some Ssam goodness.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Can't wait to wrap up some deliciousness.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=87a1c6f7-e3d5-46ff-8d67-7e45a2dc37e8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
