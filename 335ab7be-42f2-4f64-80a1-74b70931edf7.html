How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It's going pretty well. The chicken is flying off the shelves!<p class=message>That's great news! We're always busy in this Bugis street location.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's a popular spot for locals and tourists alike.<p class=message>Speaking of tourists, have you had any interesting conversations with any of them today?<p class="message sent">Actually, yeah. There was a group of tourists from Japan who loved our chicken so much that they asked if they could take some back to their hotel.<p class=message>Wow, that's a compliment! Did you give them a discount?<p class="message sent">Of course. It's always good to keep the customers happy.<p class=message>Agreed. Speaking of happy customers, have we been receiving good reviews online?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I've been shouted out for my secret blend of spices on the chicken.<p class=message>That's awesome! Keep up the good work. We want to keep that buzz going.<p class="message sent">Will do. Speaking of work, do you need any help with anything?<p class=message>Actually, yes. Can you make a fresh batch of chicken tenders? We're starting to run low.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. How many orders do we need?<p class=message>Let's go with ten for now.<p class="message sent">Got it. And should I make more fries, too?<p class=message>No, we still have enough of those for now. But thanks for asking.<p class="message sent">No problem. I'll get started on the tenders right away.<p class=message>Thanks, B. You're a lifesaver.<p class="message sent">It's all in a day's work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=33592ab2-9799-443f-a89a-11a78d0b4267.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
