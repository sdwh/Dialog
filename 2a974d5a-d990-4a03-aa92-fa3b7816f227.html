How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey, it's going pretty well. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great! I'm excited to hear all about your experiences as a subject of an interview.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! I'm happy to share. What would you like to know?<p class=message>Well, first of all, can you tell me how you felt when the journalist approached you for the interview?<p class="message sent">At first, I was a bit nervous because I wasn't sure what kind of questions they would ask. But as we talked more, I found myself getting more comfortable and enjoying the conversation.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Speaking of conversation, where did the interview take place?<p class="message sent">We met up at a coffee shop in the city. It was a nice and cozy spot, and the atmosphere helped me relax.<p class=message>I love going to coffee shops! Did you order anything while you were there?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. I got a latte with a shot of caramel syrup. It was delicious!<p class=message>Yum, that sounds amazing. Okay, next question - what was the most surprising thing the journalist asked you during the interview?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. I think the most surprising question was when they asked me about my hidden talent. I wasn't expecting that one!<p class=message>Ooh, interesting. What did you say?<p class="message sent">I told them that I'm really good at juggling! It's a hobby of mine that not many people know about.<p class=message>Wow, I'm impressed. I can barely juggle two things, let alone three. Alright, last question - have you seen the article that the journalist wrote? What did you think of it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did see it! I thought it was really well-written and captured our conversation perfectly. I was happy with the way it turned out.<p class=message>That's awesome. Thanks for sharing your experience with me, B! It was great catching up.<p class="message sent">Of course, anytime! It was fun reminiscing about the interview with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a92f124-9ea6-4213-a394-b2f1b716f1cd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
