Welcome to our farm. What brings you here today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm just here to experience fruit picking. It's my first time doing this.<p class=message>Well, it's a great way to spend a day in the sunshine. We have plenty of fruit trees for you to choose from. What type of fruit do you like picking?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of apples and pears. Do you have any of those?<p class=message>Absolutely! Check out that row over there. Those are our best apples on the farm. And the pear trees are just behind them.<p class="message sent">Wow, there's so much fruit to choose from. Do you have any tips for picking the best apples and pears?<p class=message>Sure thing. Look for ones that are nice and firm to the touch, with no bruises or soft spots. And always try to pick them gently - you don't want to damage the fruit or the tree.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice. I'll be sure to keep that in mind. By the way, what do you do with all the leftover fruit?<p class=message>Well, we sell most of it to local markets and grocery stores. But sometimes we make some delicious apple pies and pear tarts for ourselves!<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds amazing. Do you have any secret family recipes?<p class=message>Sorry mate, that's classified information! But trust me, they're delicious.<p class="message sent">Haha, okay. I'll take your word for it. This has been such a fun experience. I never knew picking fruit could be so enjoyable.<p class=message>That's the beauty of farming - every day is different, and every season brings new surprises. We're glad you could be a part of it.<p class="message sent">It's been a pleasure. Thanks for all your help and tips. I'll definitely come back here again next season.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aa58b185-b120-403e-aac4-7c0ab1c14277.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
