I'm the software engineer working on this project.<p class="message sent">Hi, glad to meet you too. I'm the blockchain engineer in charge.<p class=message>So, let's talk about how we can develop a trusted blockchain application system.<p class="message sent">Sure, have you worked with blockchain before?<p class=message>Not extensively, but I have some knowledge about it.<p class="message sent">Ok, well, first things first. We need to ensure that the system is secure and cannot be tampered with.<p class=message>Agreed. And we also need to make sure it is easy to use for our customers.<p class="message sent">Of course, user experience is important too. Have you considered implementing smart contracts?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I think they could play a significant role in the system.<p class="message sent">Great, and what about the consensus mechanism? How should we decide on that?<p class=message>I was thinking of using Proof of Authority, what do you think?<p class="message sent">That could work, but let's review other consensus mechanisms just to be sure.<p class=message>Sure thing. We also need to have a clear and transparent system for data storage.<p class="message sent">I agree. And we should consider using a distributed file system for decentralized storage.<p class=message>Good idea. We also need to make sure the system can handle high volumes of transactions.<p class="message sent">Yes, scalability is a crucial aspect. Have you researched sharding?<p class=message>I have, and I think it could work for our purposes.<p class="message sent">Great, let's look into other solutions too. This is going to be a fun and challenging project!<p class=message>Absolutely, it's exciting to be working on the forefront of technology.<p class="message sent">Agreed, and it's going to be satisfying to create a reliable and practical application.<p class=message>Definitely, I'm looking forward to working on this with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise. Let's get started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7aa462d6-8ae2-4de0-a0c6-5f8e253e04ee.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
