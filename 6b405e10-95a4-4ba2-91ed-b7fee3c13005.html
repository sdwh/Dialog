How's everyone doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Ms. A! I'm doing well, thank you.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, today we're going to talk about idioms. Who knows what an idiom is?<p class="message sent">An idiom is a phrase that doesn't mean what it literally says, right?<p class=message>Exactly! Can you give us an example?<p class="message sent">Sure. Like when someone says "it's raining cats and dogs" but it just means it's raining really hard.<p class=message>Perfect! Now, let's see if you can guess what these idioms mean. "On cloud nine."<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think that means someone is really happy?<p class=message>Yes! You're catching on quickly. How about "barking up the wrong tree?"<p class="message sent">Maybe it means someone is blaming the wrong person for something?<p class=message>Great job! You're a natural at this. And, "cat got your tongue?"<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not sure about that one.<p class=message>It means when someone is quiet and not saying anything.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that's interesting. I've never heard that one before.<p class=message>That's the fun of idioms! You get to learn something new and quirky everyday. Do you have any favorites, B?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I really like "when pigs fly." It's just such a funny image in my head.<p class=message>It definitely is! Well, that's all we have time for today. Keep practicing those idioms, everyone!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b3fef13-3306-41e7-bb58-ba1c1f2c382d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
