How's it going? My name is Alex, and I work in online marketing.<p class="message sent">Hi Alex, I'm Betty! I run a small business selling handmade jewelry. I'm here to learn more about how to market my products online.<p class=message>That's great! What kind of platforms are you currently using to sell your products?<p class="message sent">Right now, I'm primarily using social media, like Instagram and Facebook. But I'm open to exploring other options as well.<p class=message>Definitely. Have you considered using paid advertising on these platforms? It can be a great way to reach more potential customers.<p class="message sent">I have, but I'm a bit intimidated by the process. Do you think it's worth the investment?<p class=message>Absolutely! With the right targeting and ad copy, you can see a lot of success with paid advertising. Plus, it's easier to track your return on investment compared to other forms of marketing.<p class="message sent">That's true. How much budget would you recommend for someone just starting out?<p class=message>It really depends on your business and goals, but I typically recommend starting with a budget of around $100 per month to test the waters.<p class="message sent">Okay, thank you for the advice! Do you have any other tips for someone like me who's just starting out with online marketing?<p class=message>Definitely. Make sure your website and social media profiles are optimized for search engines and user experience. Also, don't be afraid to experiment with different types of content and strategies to see what works best for your audience.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. It sounds like there's a lot to learn, but it's also exciting to try new things.<p class=message>Absolutely! I love helping small businesses like yours grow and succeed online. If you ever have any questions or need more help, don't hesitate to reach out to me.<p class="message sent">Thanks so much, Alex! It was great chatting with you today.<p class=message>Likewise, Betty. I wish you all the best with your business and hope to hear from you soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c01cb003-67b8-47e9-99d4-5164c8c0db22.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
