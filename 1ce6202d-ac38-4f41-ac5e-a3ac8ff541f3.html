How's your day going?<p class="message sent">It's good, just trying to wrap my head around how to test this new e-commerce site we're building.<p class=message>Yeah, testing can be tricky. What's the site like?<p class="message sent">It's pretty robust with a lot of different pages and user flows. So, we really need to make sure everything is working smoothly.<p class=message>Have you thought about using automated testing?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we've been exploring that option. It would definitely help speed up the testing process.<p class=message>Absolutely. And don't forget manual testing too - it's still important.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We have a team of testers who will be doing manual testing as well, but it's always good to have automated tests to catch any unexpected issues.<p class=message>That makes sense. Have you considered using any testing frameworks or tools?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we're looking into using Selenium for automated testing and JIRA for bug tracking. Have you used those before?<p class=message>I have some experience with Selenium, it's a great tool. JIRA is pretty popular too for project management and issue tracking.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we've used JIRA before and it's really helpful for keeping track of everything.<p class=message>Sounds like you guys have a solid plan in place. I'm sure the site will be flawless by the time it goes live!<p class="message sent">Fingers crossed!
