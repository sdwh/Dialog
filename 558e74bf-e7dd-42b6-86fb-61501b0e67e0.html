What's up?<p class=message>I was just thinking about how we can protect our clients' data from these hackers.<p class="message sent">That's definitely a concern. As a cybersecurity specialist, my suggestion is to tighten our security measures.<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea. Are there any specific measures we can take?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Having a multi-factor authentication system and regularly updating our software can go a long way.<p class=message>That's great. As a network engineer, I believe we can also implement firewalls and VPNs to protect data transmission.<p class="message sent">Excellent point. We should also consider implementing intrusion detection and prevention systems to alert us of any unusual activity.<p class=message>Hmm, that's something I didn't think of. It's great to have you on board, B.<p class="message sent">Happy to help. Together, we can make sure our clients' data is safe and secure!<p class=message>Absolutely. And who knows, maybe we'll even prevent the next cyber attack from happening.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=558907cb-2e93-4105-86b1-d04e8bc74d44.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
