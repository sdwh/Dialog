Where would you like to connect?<p class=message>I am flying from New York to Toronto, so I would like to make a connection in Chicago.<p class="message sent">Alright, I see a few options for you. How much time do you have between your flights?<p class=message>About two hours.<p class="message sent">Great, that should be plenty of time. Have you flown through O'Hare Airport before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it a big airport?<p class="message sent">It is one of the biggest airports in the United States, so I recommend giving yourself enough time to navigate and find your gate. Would you like me to help you book the tickets?<p class=message>Yes, please.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's see what we have available. Ah, here we go, I found a flight that looks good. You'll leave New York in the morning and arrive in Chicago with two hours to spare before your connecting flight to Toronto.<p class=message>Sounds perfect. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>Nope, that's it for now. Thanks again!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Have a great trip! And don't forget to stop at Garrett Popcorn in O'Hare airport, it's a must-try Chicago specialty.<p class=message>I will definitely keep that in mind, thank you for the recommendation. Bye!<p class="message sent">Goodbye!
