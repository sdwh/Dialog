It's one of our specialties.<p class="message sent">Actually, I haven't. How spicy is it?<p class=message>It's not too spicy, but it definitely has a kick to it. Want me to bring you a bowl to try?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll give it a shot. Anything to warm me up in this chilly weather.<p class=message>Speaking of the weather, it's pretty cold today. I hope our guests can stay warm and enjoy their meal.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we've got a big group coming in for a business lunch. Let's make sure we give them the best service we can.<p class=message>Don't worry, I've got the kitchen under control. And you're always great with customers, B.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. You know what, I have a funny joke to tell them. Why did the tomato turn red?<p class=message>Why?<p class="message sent">Because it saw the salad dressing! (laughs)<p class=message>(laughs) That's a good one. I'm sure they'll love it.<p class="message sent">Speaking of salads, remind me to ask the kitchen for some extra carrots. One of our customers asked for a vegetable-heavy dish.<p class=message>Sure thing. I'll make a note of it. And while we're at it, let's check on those dumplings we have steaming.<p class="message sent">Good idea. They're smelling so good, I don't know how I'm going to resist sneaking one.<p class=message>(laughs) I don't blame you. They are pretty tasty. But let's make sure we save them for the guests.<p class="message sent">Fine, fine. But if we have any leftover, you know where to find me.<p class=message>(laughs) Deal. Alright, let's go make sure everything is perfect for our guests.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8274a8f7-f601-419b-907d-ad33f56cc7b8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
