What book are you reading?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. I'm reading "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams. It's hilarious!<p class=message>Oh, I've heard of that one. I've been meaning to give it a read. What's it about?<p class="message sent">Well, it's basically a sci-fi comedy about a man named Arthur Dent and his alien friend Ford Prefect as they travel through space.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. I'm more of a non-fiction reader myself. I'm currently reading "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg.<p class="message sent">That's a great book! I read it last year for my psychology class.<p class=message>Really? What was your biggest takeaway from it?<p class="message sent">I learned a lot about how our habits form and how we can change them. It's helped me a lot in breaking some bad habits and creating new, healthier ones.<p class=message>That's awesome. I might have to borrow your copy when you're done with it.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Do you need any recommendations for non-fiction books?<p class=message>Actually, I do. I'm really interested in business and entrepreneurship.<p class="message sent">Well, have you read "The Lean Startup" by Eric Ries or "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey?<p class=message>I haven't, but they're definitely going on my to-read list now.<p class="message sent">Great! I'm always happy to share my love of reading with others.<p class=message>Speaking of reading, we probably should lower our voices a bit. We are in the library after all.<p class="message sent">Oh, right. Good point. Thanks for reminding me.<p class=message>No problem. Happy reading!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6428db38-3240-42c8-a9a3-e9a38cb39d12.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
