It's really scary to think of all the things that could go wrong out there.<p class=message>Definitely. But the good news is that we're prepared for these types of situations thanks to our training.<p class="message sent">That's true. Speaking of training, do you remember that time we had to do the emergency evacuation drill?<p class=message>Oh yeah, I remember. It was a mix of feeling nervous and slightly excited at the same time.<p class="message sent">Same here! I was a bit afraid of the height, but it was a good experience to learn how to deal with emergencies.<p class=message>Absolutely. And it's not just about dealing with emergencies at sea, but also about being able to help others in need.<p class="message sent">That's right. It's a sense of responsibility that comes along with the job, and it's important to always be ready for anything that may happen.<p class=message>True. But let's not forget that we should also enjoy the beauty of the sea and appreciate our job.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we definitely should. By the way, have you tried fishing during our downtime?<p class=message>Actually, I have! It's a great stress reliever and it's always exciting to catch something.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. I've been meaning to try it myself. Maybe we can plan a fishing trip soon.<p class=message>Sounds great to me! Just as long as we're careful and follow all the safety protocols, of course.<p class="message sent">Of course. Safety should always be our top priority, whether we're out there to catch fish or respond to emergencies.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e9bf72de-f8ec-481d-b82f-2f7ba21ab982.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
