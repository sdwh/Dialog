We just finished writing the database schema and now we're moving onto the API.<p class=message>Nice! I've been working on the frontend and I was thinking of using Bootstrap for the design. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Using Bootstrap would save us a lot of time and effort, it's a great choice. I can't wait to see what you come up with.<p class=message>Yeah, Bootstrap is definitely a time-saver. But do you think it will work well with ASP.NET MVC 5?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, Bootstrap works well with all kinds of web development frameworks. Plus, it's responsive, so it should look good on all devices.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I was a bit worried about how it would look on mobile devices.<p class="message sent">Not to worry, Bootstrap has got our back. Have you considered using any frontend frameworks like Vue.js or React?<p class=message>I was thinking about it, but I'm not that confident with frontend frameworks just yet. I'd like to stick with what I know for now.<p class="message sent">That's completely understandable. It's better to stick with what you know rather than diving into something you're not familiar with. Plus, ASP.NET MVC 5 is a great option.<p class=message>Thanks for understanding. I feel like Bootstrap and ASP.NET MVC 5 are a great combination for our project.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, and if you have any questions or need any help, just let me know. We're all in this together!<p class=message>Thanks B, I appreciate it. Do you think we can finish this project by the end of the month?<p class="message sent">Assuming everything goes smoothly, I think we can definitely finish it on time. But we should factor in some buffer time for unforeseen circumstances.<p class=message>Good point. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks again for your help.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help out. Let's build an amazing website together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=50622f25-6901-4d02-872f-4aec7ee0a190.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
