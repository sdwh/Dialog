She's a big fan of soccer!<p class="message sent">No way! I've been looking for an excuse to join the soccer team. Maybe we can strategize and finally catch her attention.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. First step, we need to attend the soccer tryouts next week.<p class="message sent">Good point. I haven't played soccer since I was a kid, so I hope I'm not too rusty.<p class=message>Don't worry, we can brush up on our skills by practicing after school. Plus, we need to make sure we have good stamina too.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I heard that the coach is really strict and only selects the best players.<p class=message>That's why we need to give it our all. And if all else fails, we can always bring her to the games and show her our support for the team.<p class="message sent">Yeah, but I have a feeling that if we make the team, we'll impress her even more.<p class=message>Definitely. And who knows, maybe we'll even become soccer stars and make it to the championships.<p class="message sent">Hah, dreams do come true! But I think at this point, I'd be happy just to have an excuse to talk to her.<p class=message>Hey, no matter the motivation, chasing after our dreams is always a good idea. And if that dream involves getting the girl, even better.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the pep talk. Let's get practicing and make our soccer aspirations a reality!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bb83a8f5-5ebb-4874-babe-7c26fbbb33ec.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
