It's frustrating, but I can't seem to stop trying.<p class="message sent">I know what you mean. It's like we're addicted to challenges.<p class=message>Exactly! And speaking of challenges, have you ever tried playing this game with your eyes closed?<p class="message sent">What? No, I haven't. Is it even possible?<p class=message>Well, I've tried it a few times and it's definitely a fun way to mix things up.<p class="message sent">That sounds crazy, but maybe I'll give it a shot next time.<p class=message>Oh, and have you heard about this new game coming out next month?<p class="message sent">No, what game?<p class=message>It's called "Escape the Island" and it's like a survival game where you have to find food and build shelter.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that sounds intense. I think I'll stick to puzzles for now.<p class=message>Haha, yeah, puzzles are definitely more relaxing. But it's always good to try something new.<p class="message sent">You're right. I might just have to step out of my comfort zone and give it a try.<p class=message>That's the spirit! Who knows, you might end up loving it.<p class="message sent">Well, if it's anything like this puzzle, I'll probably end up wanting to throw my computer out the window.<p class=message>Haha, don't worry. We'll get through it together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1a6d46fd-9fc5-4f9d-af13-87f252379cb4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
