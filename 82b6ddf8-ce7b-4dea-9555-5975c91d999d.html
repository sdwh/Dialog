How's school going?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thanks for asking, dad. I passed my math exam with flying colors.<p class=message>Good for you! How about your basketball team? Did you win your game last week?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, we lost 63-62 at the buzzer. It was heartbreaking.<p class=message>I'm sorry to hear that. But don't worry, there's always next time. By the way, have you seen the ducks in the pond?<p class="message sent">Yeah, they're so cute. Can we feed them?<p class=message>Sure, we can buy some bread at the snack bar. But don't feed them too much or they'll get sick.<p class="message sent">Got it, dad. Look, there's a squirrel over there!<p class=message>Wow, you have sharp eyes. It's so quick, I can barely see it.<p class="message sent">It's trying to steal that lady's sandwich. Should we go over there?<p class=message>Well, we should respect the wildlife and let it be. Besides, we wouldn't want to get in trouble with the park rangers.<p class="message sent">Yeah, you're right. Hey, dad, do you remember when we went camping last summer?<p class=message>How could I forget? We had a blast. We should plan another trip soon.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Maybe we can invite some of my friends to come along.<p class=message>Sounds like a great idea. But let's focus on enjoying this beautiful day first.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Thanks for taking me out for a walk, dad.<p class=message>Of course, son. Spending time with you is one of my favorite things to do.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=82b5a84a-fbae-4951-8016-2d50ba4e997f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
