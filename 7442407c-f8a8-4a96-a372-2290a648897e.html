We have a campus tour scheduled for next week, and an open house event at the end of the month. Would you be interested in attending either of those?<p class="message sent">Yes, I would definitely like to learn more about the school before making a decision.<p class=message>Great! We also offer personalized tours for students who can't make the scheduled events. Just let me know and we can set one up for you.<p class="message sent">That's really helpful, thank you. What about scholarships and financial aid?<p class=message>We have a variety of scholarships available for qualifying students, and our financial aid office can help you with any questions or concerns. Have you filled out the FAFSA yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. I just wanted to know if there are any additional steps I need to take.<p class=message>Not at this time. Just keep an eye out for any additional scholarship opportunities that may arise before the enrollment deadline.<p class="message sent">Alright, thanks for the info. One last question - do you recommend any specific majors for students interested in the business field?<p class=message>Well, we have a fantastic business program, but ultimately it depends on your personal interests and career goals. I recommend talking to our academic advisors to help determine the best fit for you.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for your time and help today!<p class=message>Of course, best of luck with your decision-making process!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=744136c9-ced9-44ce-a16f-b0f264a8cb98.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
