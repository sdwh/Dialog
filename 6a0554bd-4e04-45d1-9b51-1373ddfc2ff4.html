How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks for asking. What's up?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking about the ingredients we should use in the hamburger. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That's a good question. I think we should use lettuce, onion, tomato, cheese, hamburger patty, and pickles. What do you think?<p class=message>I completely agree. Let's make sure to use the highest quality ingredients we can find. That way, our customers will love it.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a great idea. We want to make sure our customers are happy with the food they're eating.<p class=message>Speaking of customers, have you thought about any special promotions we could run to attract more people?<p class="message sent">Well, how about a "buy one, get one free" deal for the first week we're open?<p class=message>That's an excellent idea. That should bring in a lot of people.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it. I think it's important to offer our customers something special.<p class=message>Agreed. And maybe we could even have some fun with the names of our burgers. How about the "Big Cheesy," or the "Ultimate Veggie Delight?"<p class="message sent">Haha, I like it. That will definitely catch people's attention.<p class=message>Great! And we can also have a build-your-own-burger option, so customers can choose exactly what they want on it.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. That way, everyone can enjoy their burger exactly the way they like it.<p class=message>This is all sounding fantastic. I can't wait to get started.<p class="message sent">Me neither! It's going to be an exciting adventure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6a04d1ae-2481-4421-9588-950f158bfa9a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
