I've been looking forward to this lesson for weeks!<p class=message>Awesome! Do you have any previous surfing experience or are you a total newbie?<p class="message sent">I've tried it a few times before, but I wouldn't call myself experienced.<p class=message>No worries, we'll start with the basics then. Have you got your board and wetsuit?<p class="message sent">Yes, I rented them from the surf shop down the road. They even threw in some wax for the board!<p class=message>Perfect. So, the first thing we need to do is warm up our muscles with some stretches.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. What stretches do we need to do?<p class=message>We'll do some arm and shoulder stretches, leg stretches, and some twists to loosen up our core.<p class="message sent">Got it. Let's get to it then!<p class=message>Great job with the stretches. Now, let's take a look at how to position ourselves on the board.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I remember struggling with that before. Can you show me the proper way to lie down on the board?<p class=message>Sure thing. Lie on your stomach with your feet together and your hands by your shoulders.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. How do we stand up on the board once we catch a wave?<p class=message>We'll work on that later. For now, let's practice catching some smaller waves and getting the hang of standing up on the board.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Let's do it!<p class=message>You're doing great! You're getting up on the board really quickly.<p class="message sent">Thanks, it's thanks to your amazing guidance!<p class=message>Haha, don't give me too much credit. You're a natural. Okay, let's take a short break and then we'll work on some more advanced maneuvers.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Thanks for making this lesson both fun and informative!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=adca9fee-130d-472e-ab51-c385da7e5a67.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
