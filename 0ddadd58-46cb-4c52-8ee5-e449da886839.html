I hope you're all well-rested and ready for today's class.<p class="message sent">Good morning, teacher. I'm feeling great today. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks for asking. So, today we're going to learn about phrasal verbs. Have you heard of them before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They're those tricky verbs with multiple meanings, right?<p class=message>Exactly. But don't worry, we'll break them down and make them easy to understand. Can you give me an example of a phrasal verb?<p class="message sent">Sure, how about "break up"? It can mean to end a relationship or to separate something into smaller parts.<p class=message>Great example! See, you already know more than you think. Let's practice some more together.<p class=message>Okay, now let's take a break and lighten the mood. Did you hear about the new restaurant down the street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it like?<p class=message>It's a fancy sushi place called "Rolling Waves". I heard their rolls are amazing.<p class="message sent">Sounds cool. Maybe we should all go there for our next class celebration.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. Now, back to phrasal verbs. Let's review what we learned so far.<p class=message>Time's up for today. Great job, everyone. See you next time.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the lesson, teacher. I had fun and learned a lot.<p class=message>You're welcome, B.
