It doesn't quite fit me right.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Do you want to exchange it for a different size, or would you like a refund?<p class=message>Actually, I think I'll look for something else to exchange it for. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Of course! What about this striped shirt? It's a similar style, but it might fit you better.<p class=message>Hmm, I don't usually wear stripes, but I'll give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class="message sent">No problem! Let me know if you need any help finding anything else.<p class=message>Actually, I was also thinking of returning these pants. They're a bit too long for me.<p class="message sent">Alright, well we have the same style in a shorter length. Would you like to exchange them for that?<p class=message>Oh great, thank you. This has been hassle-free!<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear it. Is there anything else I can help you with today?<p class=message>No, I think that's it for now. Thanks again for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e4c5df9-5463-4f53-ad88-1a70c334adee.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
