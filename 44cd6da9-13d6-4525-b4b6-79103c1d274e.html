How's our candy production looking today?<p class="message sent">It's looking great, A. Our machines are running smoothly and our team is doing an excellent job keeping up with production.<p class=message>That's fantastic news! What candy are we making today?<p class="message sent">We're making a batch of chocolate covered pretzels and some gummy bears.<p class=message>Yum! I love both of those. Have you tried the new flavor of gummy bears we're making?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard they're supposed to be spicy.<p class=message>Spicy gummy bears? That sounds interesting! I can't wait to try them.<p class="message sent">Just be careful, they might pack a punch.<p class=message>Thanks for the warning, B. Hey, while we're on the topic of candy, what's your all-time favorite candy?<p class="message sent">That's a tough one. I think I have to go with sour gummy worms. What about you, A?<p class=message>I'm a classic candy guy. Give me a bag of Skittles any day and I'll be happy.<p class="message sent">Can't go wrong with Skittles. Say, have you ever thought about making your own candy at home?<p class=message>Actually, yes! I've been thinking about making homemade chocolate truffles. Have you ever made your own candy before?<p class="message sent">I have, but it's been a while. I'm more of a taste tester than a candy maker.<p class=message>Well, if you ever want to learn, you know who to come to.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. Speaking of taste testing, I think it's time for a candy break.<p class=message>Agreed! Let's go grab some candy and take a quick break before we dive back into production.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=44cabe93-8c42-4b8b-855b-a8563adff44a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
