Are you our taxi driver today?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. And where might you be headed?<p class=message>We're actually on our way to beautiful Hokkaido.<p class="message sent">Ah, a classic destination. Are you familiar with it?<p class=message>Not really, this is our first time going. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Well, the food and the scenery are definitely must-sees. Have you ever tried seafood?<p class=message>Yes, we have. But we're told Hokkaido's seafood is particularly good.<p class="message sent">You bet it is! And the mountains are just breathtaking. You should definitely check them out.<p class=message>That sounds great. I can hardly wait to arrive.<p class="message sent">It's not too far a journey, but there are plenty of attractions on the way if you wish to stop.<p class=message>Hmm, that's a thought. Any quirky places you know of?<p class="message sent">How do you feel about a drive-in theater?<p class=message>That sounds like fun! I haven't been to one in years.<p class="message sent">It's a bit of a classic experience, don't you think?<p class=message>Absolutely. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class="message sent">No problem, just doing my job. And while we're on the topic of classics, what's your favorite song?<p class=message>Oh, I couldn't possibly pick just one. I have a different favorite every week. What about you?<p class="message sent">Well, my current favorite is 'Dancing Queen.' It's always a classic.<p class=message>That's a great one. I'll have to add it to my playlist.<p class="message sent">It's a must-have. Keep the mood light, especially on long journeys.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9b7b8998-cb58-48ad-9b5e-50692fe7548b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
