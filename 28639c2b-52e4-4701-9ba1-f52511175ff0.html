How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It's going pretty well. We have a lot of customers today. How about you?<p class=message>Same here! I'm trying to get all these dishes ready for our hungry customers.<p class="message sent">Speaking of dishes, have you tried our new recipe for the salmon?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's different about it?<p class="message sent">Well, we added a citrus glaze and served it with a side of roasted asparagus. It's delicious!<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I'll have to try it after work.<p class="message sent">Definitely do! So, how much longer until the next order is up?<p class=message>It should be ready in about five minutes. Can you check on the customers at table six in the meantime?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Hey, A, did I tell you about the time I accidentally spilled coffee on a customer's suit?<p class=message>No, you didn't. What happened?<p class="message sent">It was pretty embarrassing. I felt terrible and offered to pay for the dry cleaning. Thankfully, the customer was really understanding about it.<p class=message>Well, accidents happen. Just be careful next time!<p class="message sent">Ha-ha, I will. You're right. So, what's the special tonight?<p class=message>It's a pan-seared steak with a rosemary butter sauce and garlic mashed potatoes. It's one of our best-sellers.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds delicious. I might have to order that for myself.<p class=message>It's definitely a customer favorite. I'll make sure to let our chef know you're interested.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! You're always such a great help.<p class=message>No problem, B! It's all part of being a team in the restaurant business.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=28616861-a95e-4e15-bf23-5b15db06e038.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
