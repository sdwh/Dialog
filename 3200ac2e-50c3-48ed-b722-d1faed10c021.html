How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi A! I'm doing well, how about you?<p class=message>All good, thanks. So, today we need to discuss how we can reduce the quality issues in our software.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. I was thinking maybe we could improve our testing process to catch more bugs.<p class=message>Hmm, that's a good idea. But what kind of testing process do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">Well, maybe we could use more automated testing tools to speed up the process and make it more accurate.<p class=message>That's a smart approach. But I was also thinking we could involve some more actual users in our testing to see how the software performs in real-life situations.<p class="message sent">Great idea! It would definitely give us more valuable feedback from our users and help us improve the overall quality.<p class=message>And what about the bug reports we receive? Do we have a system in place to organize and prioritize them?<p class="message sent">Yes, we use a bug tracking tool to keep track of all the issues reported and assign them to the relevant team members for resolution.<p class=message>Perfect. That's a great starting point for improving our quality control. Let's plan out some concrete steps to put these ideas into practice.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm excited to see how we can make our software better and more reliable.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=31ff64a8-df63-4c9d-a837-ecbdf77d9e6a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
