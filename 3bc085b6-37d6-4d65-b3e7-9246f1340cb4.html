It can help us minimize risks and ensure we're in compliance with regulations.<p class="message sent">So how do we get started with implementing it?<p class=message>Well, we first need to conduct a risk assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities in our systems.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. What else do we need to do?<p class=message>We also need to develop and implement policies and procedures to manage those risks and ensure information is secure.<p class="message sent">Got it. And who should be responsible for implementing and maintaining these policies?<p class=message>That would be the information security team. Do we have an information security team?<p class="message sent">Umm, not exactly...maybe we'll need to hire someone?<p class=message>Yeah, or we could train an existing employee with the necessary skills.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. We should also make sure everyone in the company is aware of the importance of information security.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we'll need to regularly review and update our policies and procedures to keep up with changing technology and threats.<p class="message sent">So it sounds like implementing ISO 27001 is an ongoing process, not just a one-time thing.<p class=message>Yes, that's correct. But it's worth it to protect our sensitive information and ensure the trust of our clients and customers.<p class="message sent">I agree. Let's get started on this ASAP.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3bb6cc23-ebf2-49de-9242-822b97fc72cf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
