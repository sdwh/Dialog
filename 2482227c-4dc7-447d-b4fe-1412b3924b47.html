Can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Of course! Our indoor pool is perfect for anyone looking to take a swim or just relax. We have a heated pool, a hot tub, and even a sauna!<p class=message>That sounds amazing. How can I use the pool? Do I need to reserve a time?<p class="message sent">You don't need to reserve a time, but we do ask that you sign in at the front desk before going for a swim. Also, please remember to bring a towel from your room, as we don't provide them at the pool.<p class=message>Got it. So what are the hours of the pool?<p class="message sent">The pool is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.<p class=message>That's great. Thanks for letting me know. Is there anything else I should be aware of before using the pool?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do ask that you shower before entering the pool, as well as refrain from using any glassware or alcohol in the pool area.<p class=message>Understood. Thanks for the heads up. One last thing, is there a lifeguard on duty?<p class="message sent">No, there isn't a lifeguard on duty, so please swim at your own risk. However, we do have a phone by the pool to call for emergency assistance if needed.<p class=message>Sounds good. Thanks for all the information! I can't wait to take a dip in the pool.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Enjoy your swim!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2481588b-b7b2-423f-a964-14438cc24666.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
