This is my first time picking fruits, and it's very interesting. What fruits do you have here?<p class=message>We've got a variety of fruits, such as plums, peaches, and apricots. They're all fresh and juicy, ready to be picked.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious! I never knew there were this many types of fruit trees. Can you tell me more about them?<p class=message>Sure thing! The plums are perfect for pies and jams, while the peaches and apricots are great for snacking. You can never have too many fruits in your diet.<p class="message sent">I totally agree. So, how do you know when the fruits are ripe enough to be picked?<p class=message>Well, it depends on the type of fruit. Generally, you want to look for a certain color and texture. For example, plums should be slightly soft to the touch and have a deep purple color.<p class="message sent">Interesting. Do you have any tips for picking the fruits without damaging them?<p class=message>Of course. It's important to gently pull the fruit from the tree, rather than yanking it off. You don't want to risk damaging the branch or the fruit itself.<p class="message sent">Got it. This is hard work, but it's a fun experience. I'm glad I came here to try it out.<p class=message>We're happy to have you! Picking fruits is a tradition here in South Australia. It's a great way to spend time with family and friends while enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great way to stay healthy and active. I'm definitely going to come back and do this again.<p class=message>We'd love to have you back anytime. And who knows, maybe next time you can even try making your own fruit pie using the fruits you picked.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a delicious plan. I can already taste it. Thank you for the suggestion!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=914f9655-af8f-444a-90f2-fe64dcbed534.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
