Are you thinking of doing a particular regional cuisine or something more international?<p class="message sent">Actually, we're looking to branch out and do more vegetarian and vegan options. Do you have any recommendations for that?<p class=message>Oh, absolutely. There are a lot of great options for that, like quinoa bowls or miso soup with tofu. You could also try doing vegan versions of classic dishes like lentil shepherd's pie.<p class="message sent">Those are all great ideas, thanks. Do you have any tips on how to make the food more appealing to passengers?<p class=message>Presentation is key. Make sure the food looks as good as it tastes, with garnishes and colorful ingredients. Also, make sure the portions aren't too small or too big - just the right size for a satisfying meal.<p class="message sent">Got it, that's really helpful. Do you have any favorite dishes that you think would be great for in-flight meals?<p class=message>Personally, I love a good chicken or vegetable curry. They're flavorful and satisfying without being too heavy. And for breakfast, you can't go wrong with a classic eggs Benedict.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely keep those in mind. Thanks so much for your help!<p class=message>No problem, happy to assist. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6cd336af-d68a-4f63-ad4a-1b1c64ad8e0a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
