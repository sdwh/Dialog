My name is A and I'll be your waiter for tonight. Are you ready to order?<p class="message sent">G'day mate! I'm B, the chef here. Nice to meet you. What would you recommend from our menu?<p class=message>Our most popular dish is the kangaroo steak, would you like to try that?<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing, mate! I'll make sure to cook it to perfection. Would you like that rare, medium or well done?<p class=message>The customer would like it medium, please.<p class="message sent">Got it. And how about a side of our signature garlic roasted potatoes?<p class=message>That sounds great, I'll go ahead and order that for you. Would you like anything to drink with your meal?<p class="message sent">How about a cold beer to wash it all down? Maybe a local one, like a Cooper's Pale Ale?<p class=message>Excellent choice, sir. I'll send that right over.<p class="message sent">Thanks, mate! By the way, have you tried our lamingtons for dessert? They're a real Aussie classic.<p class=message>I haven't, but they sound delicious. I'll have to try them sometime.<p class="message sent">You won't regret it, trust me. Especially with a nice cup of coffee to go with it.<p class=message>I'll make sure to recommend that to all our customers! So, how's business been lately?<p class="message sent">Pretty good, actually. We've had a few tourists coming in and trying out our Aussie cuisine. What about you? Any interesting stories?<p class=message>We had a group of Japanese visitors the other day and they really loved our meat pies. They said it reminded them of home.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. It's always a good feeling when someone appreciates your cooking.<p class=message>Absolutely. And with that, here's your kangaroo steak. Enjoy your meal sir!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=709083c0-9606-4aad-b203-39a88c8791cd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
