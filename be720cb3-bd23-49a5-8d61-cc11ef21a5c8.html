How's it going?<p class="message sent">Great, A! How about yourself?<p class=message>Can't complain. You know, I've been doing a lot of fishing lately and I wanted to talk to you about sourcing some of my catch for your restaurant.<p class="message sent">That sounds great, A! We're always looking for fresh and local seafood to feature on our menu. What kind of fish have you been catching?<p class=message>Mostly snapper and grouper. They've been biting like crazy recently.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic. We happen to be running low on snapper right now, so we could definitely use some from you. And of course, we'd love to feature your catch on our menu.<p class=message>Awesome. I was thinking maybe we could work together on designing a dish or two that showcases the fish I catch.<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely. Let's brainstorm some ideas. Do you have any marinades or seasonings you like to use?<p class=message>Well, I usually keep it pretty simple with just salt, pepper, and a little lemon juice. But I'm open to trying new things.<p class="message sent">How about we do a snapper ceviche with some diced mango and avocado? The sweetness of the mango will balance out the acidity of the lime juice.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! And for the grouper, maybe we could do a grilled fillet with a mango salsa on top.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Let's add those to the menu and see how they do.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. And hey, if they're a hit, maybe I'll have to start fishing even more to keep up with demand!<p class="message sent">Haha, yes, we'll definitely have to step up our game. Thanks for working with me on this, A.<p class=message>Thank you, B. I can't wait to see my fish on the menu!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=be6e657c-53ab-48c7-b9f3-167becaec440.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
