How's it going with the flower arrangements for today's customers?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. Got some beautiful daisies and carnations today, perfect for spring.<p class=message>That sounds lovely! I just finished baking some blueberry muffins and lemon tarts. Want to taste?<p class="message sent">Of course! I always love to taste your baked goods. Hmm...these blueberry muffins are so moist and packed with flavor.<p class=message>That means a lot coming from a flower artist like you. Speaking of which, have you thought about doing a floral display for our window?<p class="message sent">Funny you should mention that. I came up with a design last night and brought some extra blooms just in case. Let's set it up after lunch rush.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. By the way, have you heard about the new coffee beans we're getting next week? They're supposed to be from Colombia.<p class="message sent">No way, that's awesome! We should do a special menu featuring coffee and cake pairing.<p class=message>Yes, great idea! I'll make some tiramisu and we can come up with creative coffee drinks together.<p class="message sent">I'm all for it! Speaking of creativity, I was thinking of adding some edible flowers to your desserts. It'll be a nice touch.<p class=message>Oh, I like that idea! Which flowers do you recommend?<p class="message sent">How about violets, pansies or lavender? They're all safe to eat and have delicate flavors.<p class=message>Hmm, interesting. I trust your expertise so let's try it out. We're the ultimate team, aren't we?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Together we make the best baked goods and floral arrangements in town. I couldn't ask for a better partner.<p class=message>Same here. Nothing beats seeing the smiles on our customers' faces when they taste our treats and see our bouquet art.<p class="message sent">Agreed, it's the best feeling in the world. Let's keep doing what we love and spread joy in any way we can.<p class=message>Hear, hear! To delicious desserts and beautiful blooms, cheers!<p class="message sent">Cheers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7dcc8c99-5555-4680-8279-4a3281f7f012.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
