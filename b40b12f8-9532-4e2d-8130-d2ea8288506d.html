I'm excited to be discussing internet security with you today.<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, me too. I think we need to focus on creating a strong firewall to keep the hackers out.<p class=message>Absolutely. But don't forget about the importance of educating our employees to be careful with their passwords and suspicious emails.<p class="message sent">Good point. It's amazing how many security breaches happen because someone clicked on a phishing link.<p class=message>Exactly. We should also run regular vulnerability scans on our system to catch any weaknesses before they can be exploited.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And we should make sure all software and hardware is up to date with the latest security patches.<p class=message>Another idea is to limit access to sensitive information to only those who need it. That way, if a breach does happen, the damage will be minimized.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we can also implement two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection.<p class=message>Great suggestion. It's all about being proactive and staying one step ahead of potential threats.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And don't forget about regular backups of important data, just in case.<p class=message>Of course. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Overall, I think we have some great ideas for improving our internet security.<p class="message sent">Yes, I agree. Let's put them into action and keep our system safe from harm.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Thank you for this fruitful conversation!<p class="message sent">Thank you! Let's work together to make our system more secure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b408ad85-f47d-4122-8f4a-038cafabc214.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
