The new features are pretty impressive.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've already started playing around with it. The improved indexing and query tuning are really helpful.<p class=message>Definitely! And have you tried the new temporal tables feature? It's so much easier to manage historical data now.<p class="message sent">Yes! It's really useful for tracking changes in data over time. Hey, have you tried the new exciting graph data types? They're so cool!<p class=message>Nope, not yet. Can you give me a quick explanation about it?<p class="message sent">Sure! Graph data types make it easier to model and query relationship-based data, such as social networks or project management systems.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! I can't wait to give it a try.<p class="message sent">Yeah, let's hop on and play around with it together after lunch break. Speaking of lunch, have you tried that new sandwich place downtown yet?<p class=message>I haven't, but I'm always down for something new. Do you want to grab some sandwiches there after work?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! And while we enjoy our sandwiches, we can also discuss some ideas for optimizing our code.<p class=message>Great idea! It's always beneficial to brainstorm and bounce ideas off each other.<p class="message sent">For sure! And let's not forget to celebrate our success with a nice cold beer afterward.<p class=message>Cheers to that! It's always nice to have a supportive teammate like you.<p class="message sent">Likewise! I'm grateful for having a teammate who is always willing to learn and grow together with me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f648e913-f3f2-4818-82e2-438e525f22d8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
