But you know what they say, the devil's in the details. The numbers refuse to cooperate.<p class=message>I feel you, man. I had a similar problem with the budget projections. They just wouldn't add up.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's like they have a mind of their own or something. But in our line of work, we can't let numbers beat us.<p class=message>You're right. We can't let the spreadsheets defeat us. We'll just have to roll up our sleeves and get back to work.<p class="message sent">Damn right, A. We'll show those spreadsheets who's boss.<p class=message>Hey, on another note, have you heard about the new sushi place that just opened?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class=message>I don't know, but the reviews are off the charts. Maybe we should try it out for lunch one day.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me! I love sushi. But let's aim for a day when we're not buried up to our necks in paperwork.<p class=message>Haha, definitely. It'll be a well-deserved break from the endless spreadsheets and charts.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Now, let's get back to those numbers and conquer them once and for all!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f128b6a-1e64-4c57-8c41-0f6d1f1ba1ac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
