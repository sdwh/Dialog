What would you recommend, B?<p class="message sent">How about our Absinthe? It's a classic Swiss alcohol that's often known as the 'green fairy.'<p class=message>Ooh, sounds interesting. What's it made of?<p class="message sent">It's made from wormwood, green anise, and sweet fennel. We also add other botanicals to give it a unique flavor.<p class=message>That sounds complex. Can I see how you make it?<p class="message sent">Of course! Let me show you how we prepare it. *starts pouring and mixing ingredients*<p class=message>Wow, that looks like a magical potion!<p class="message sent">It actually has a bit of a reputation for being a psychedelic drink. But don't worry, we'll make sure to serve it responsibly.<p class=message>I trust you, B. *takes a sip* This is delicious! I can taste the anise and fennel.<p class="message sent">Yes, the flavors really blend together nicely. Would you like to try another Swiss drink?<p class=message>Sure, what else do you recommend?<p class="message sent">How about a glass of Kirsch? It's a cherry brandy that's also quite popular in Switzerland.<p class=message>Perfect, I'm excited to try it. *B pours a glass and hands it to A* Cheers!<p class="message sent">Cheers! I hope you enjoy it.<p class=message>Mmm, this is lovely! It has a strong cherry flavor without being too sweet.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a great after-dinner drink. I'm glad you like it.<p class=message>Thank you so much for introducing me to these Swiss alcohols, B.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Let me know if you want to try anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eb9469ac-bbe4-4ecb-be4e-0e6f671ccaa6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
