How's it going?<p class="message sent">Doing great, A! How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. So, I wanted to pick your brain about SQL Server licensing. We're looking to purchase some licenses and I'm not sure what the best option is.<p class="message sent">Okay, sure. What are your requirements and budget?<p class=message>Well, we need multiple servers and around 50 users. As for the budget, we're trying to keep it under $20,000.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's doable. Have you considered the SQL Server Standard edition?<p class=message>I have, but I heard that the licensing can get tricky if we have multiple servers. What are your thoughts?<p class="message sent">It can be a bit confusing, but as long as you have the required number of licenses for each server, you should be fine. Another option to consider is the Core-based licensing model.<p class=message>Core-based licensing? Can you explain that to me?<p class="message sent">Sure. With Core-based licensing, you purchase licenses based on how many physical cores your servers have. This option usually works out to be more cost-effective for larger enterprises.<p class=message>Interesting. So, would that be a better option for us?<p class="message sent">It's definitely worth considering, especially if you have a lot of servers with a high number of cores. But we would need to check the pricing to confirm if it fits within your budget.<p class=message>Okay, let's do that. Thanks for the advice, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Always happy to help a fellow tech enthusiast.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=52c38775-70bb-4204-8e0f-21e8e48be802.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
