How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks for asking, A. We have a big crowd tonight, don't we?<p class=message>Yes, we do! I'm really excited to perform and show everyone our new music.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. This is going to be one of the biggest concerts of our tour.<p class=message>Have you seen the setlist for tonight? I think the fans are going to love it.<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's going to be an amazing show. I'm glad we were able to fit all of our hit songs in.<p class=message>Me too. I'm glad our fans in Osaka are excited to see us. They always show so much support.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We should make sure to thank them for coming out and supporting us.<p class=message>Speaking of thanking, have you remembered to pack the merchandise we're selling?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. We have plenty of CDs and T-shirts for fans to buy after the show.<p class=message>Great. That's how we can make some extra money and provide our fans with some cool stuff.<p class="message sent">Exactly. We should always think of ways to give back to our fans.<p class=message>Of course. That's why we make music in the first place. To share it with others and make them happy.<p class="message sent">And we've certainly done that. Our fans are amazing.<p class=message>They really are. It's humbling to see so many people show up to our concerts.<p class="message sent">Alright, A.
