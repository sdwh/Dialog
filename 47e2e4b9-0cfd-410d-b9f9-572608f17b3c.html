It's a set of standards that aims to ensure the security of information in organizations, right?<p class=message>Absolutely, you got it! The objectives are pretty important when it comes to information security. Do you know what they are?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I remember a few. Is it confidentiality, integrity, and availability?<p class=message>Yes, those are the three main ones. But there's actually more to it than that. For example, accountability, authenticity, and non-repudiation are also part of it.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, I didn't know that! It's amazing how many things need to be taken into consideration for proper security measures.<p class=message>That's right. And to ensure that all the objectives are met, organizations have to perform regular risk assessments.<p class="message sent">Risk assessments? Sounds scary.<p class=message>It's not that bad, really. It's just an evaluation of potential risks and the likelihood of them happening.<p class="message sent">I see. So what kind of controls can be put in place to mitigate these risks?<p class=message>Well, there are a lot of different types of controls, like physical, technical, organizational, and human ones.<p class="message sent">Human controls? What does that mean?<p class=message>It means incorporating policies and procedures that improve employee behavior and awareness of security risks.<p class="message sent">Ah, gotcha. So, why is ISO 27001 important?<p class=message>ISO 27001 is important because it provides a framework for organizations to implement security controls that enable them to protect their information and keep it secure.<p class="message sent">I see. And I guess it's especially important nowadays, with all the cyberattacks and data breaches happening.<p class=message>Definitely. It's important for organizations to take the necessary steps to safeguard their information and ensure they meet these security objectives.<p class="message sent">Well, thanks for explaining it all to me, A! I definitely learned a lot.<p class=message>No problem, B! Always happy to chat about information security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=47e13b17-a9ca-4c7a-8cb3-256eec03d77e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
