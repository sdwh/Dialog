What is it about?<p class=message>It's a standard that deals with information security management for third party vendors.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. So how does it work?<p class=message>Basically, an organization needs to make sure that its third-party vendors comply with the information security standards specified in the ISO 27001 Third Party standard.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a lot of paperwork.<p class=message>Haha, yeah. But it's crucial for ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.<p class="message sent">I guess that makes sense. So how do companies ensure compliance?<p class=message>Well, they usually conduct audits and assessments of their third-party vendors to map their compliance with the standard.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of work too.<p class=message>It is, but it's worth the effort to mitigate any risks that could arise from third-party vendors.<p class="message sent">Yeah, for sure. Do you know of any specific examples where it has been useful?<p class=message>Actually, a lot of companies have adopted this standard, including big names like Microsoft and Amazon.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. Looks like it's definitely something to look into for any organization.<p class=message>Absolutely. Information security is more important than ever, and this standard helps ensure that third-party vendors don't compromise it.<p class="message sent">Thanks for sharing, A. I'll definitely read up more on it.<p class=message>No problem, B. Let me know if you have any other questions!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5c964500-a1c4-4f0b-a54c-159439934963.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
