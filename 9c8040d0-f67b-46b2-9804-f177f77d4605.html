Are you the soy milk maker?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. And you must be the one who makes the Chinese pancakes.<p class=message>That's right. I'm a Chinese pancake master. I'm happy to work with you today.<p class="message sent">I'm also looking forward to our collaboration. Since we're both experts, our pancakes and soy milk will surely be tasty.<p class=message>Speaking of which, is there anything you want me to prepare before we start?<p class="message sent">No need. I have prepared the soybeans and boiled them ahead of time.<p class=message>That's very thoughtful of you. In that case, I'll start making the pancakes. Would you like to prepare the filling?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. We have pork and vegetable fillings, which one would you like me to prepare?<p class=message>Let's go with the vegetable filling today. We wouldn't want to upset our vegetarian customers.<p class="message sent">Good point! I'll start getting the vegetables ready.<p class=message>Great! While you do that, I'll start rolling out the dough.<p class="message sent">Do you use any secret recipe for your pancakes?<p class=message>Well, the basic ingredients are flour, water, and salt. But the secret is in how you knead it.<p class="message sent">I see. Kind of like how my secret for great soy milk is in the way I blend the beans.<p class=message>Absolutely! We put our heart and soul in what we make. And that's what makes it special.<p class="message sent">Finally, our dishes are ready! The soy milk looks creamy and the pancakes smell fantastic.<p class=message>I know, right? I can't wait to start serving our customers and see their reaction.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's always satisfying to see our customers enjoy authentic Chinese breakfast.<p class=message>Indeed it is. That's why we love what we do, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And who knows, if we keep this up, we might open our own restaurant!<p class=message>Ha! I like your enthusiasm. But for now, let's focus on serving these delicious pancakes and soy milk.<p class="message sent">You're right. Let's make our customers' day with our tasty cuisine!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9c7c03c7-3a23-4411-8607-b70402f2f7af.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
