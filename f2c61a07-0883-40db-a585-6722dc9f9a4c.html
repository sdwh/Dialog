Just finished prepping all the seafood for tonight's dinner service.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm looking forward to seeing some beautiful dishes tonight. Have you come up with any new recipes?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been experimenting with some new flavors and spices. I think you'll enjoy the Dungeness crab with a spicy garlic butter sauce.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! And with the Chao Phraya river right outside, it's the perfect setting. Speaking of which, have you ever caught any fish in the river?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! Whenever I have some free time, I like to fish off the dock. I've caught some decent sized catfish.<p class=message>That's impressive! Maybe we can feature some local catch on the menu as a special sometime.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And speaking of specials, we should also consider incorporating some vegetarian options for those who don't eat seafood.<p class=message>Good idea. We want to cater to everyone's tastes. And on another note, have you tried the new Thai ice cream stand down the street?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! The coconut and mango flavors are amazing.<p class=message>I agree. I'm thinking we should add some Thai-inspired desserts to the menu as well.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. Maybe a mango sticky rice or a coconut pudding.<p class=message>Perfect. We're always looking for ways to incorporate local flavors and ingredients. Anyway, I'll let you get back to your prepping. Thanks for chatting, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Looking forward to a successful dinner service tonight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f2c4169e-e309-4ac7-a823-b7708237bfc7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
