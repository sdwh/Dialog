How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing pretty well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thank you. So, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving a taxi for about 5 years now. I really enjoy it because I get to meet all kinds of interesting people like you.<p class=message>Oh, that's cool! Have you ever had any really crazy passengers?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. I once had a passenger who thought he was a pirate and insisted on wearing an eye patch during the entire ride.<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious! So, where are you from originally?<p class="message sent">I'm originally from Jamaica. Have you ever been there?<p class=message>No, I haven't, but I've heard it's beautiful. Have you ever been to any other countries?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. I've been to Canada, the UK, and a few other Caribbean countries.<p class=message>Wow, that's really cool. What's your favorite thing about driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">I think my favorite thing is getting to explore the city and finding new places that I never knew existed. Plus, I like meeting new people like I said earlier.<p class=message>Yeah, I can definitely see how that would be rewarding. Speaking of exploring, have you ever been to Los Angeles before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's actually one of my favorite cities to visit.<p class=message>That's awesome. Do you have any favorite spots that you like to go to?<p class="message sent">I really like visiting Griffith Observatory and hiking up to the Hollywood sign. It's a great way to see the city and get some exercise at the same time.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. Maybe I'll have to check those spots out while I'm here.<p class="message sent">Definitely do! You won't regret it. We're almost to your destination, by the way. Is there anything else you'd like to know or talk about?<p class=message>No, that's all for now. Thanks for the great conversation and the ride! Have a great day.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, and have a great day as well!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f2526d7-e9e5-48ee-b38a-ab2df32e41df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
