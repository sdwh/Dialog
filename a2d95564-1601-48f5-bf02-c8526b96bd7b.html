It's quite heavy, and I need to load it onto the plane.<p class=message>No problem, I'm here to help. What kind of cargo is it?<p class="message sent">It's a shipment of fancy cars. I'm surprised they trusted me with this kind of load!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds exciting! Do you get to fly the cars too?<p class="message sent">Haha, unfortunately not. My job is just to get them safely to their destination.<p class=message>Well, I'm sure the owners will be grateful for your skills. Let's see where we need to put these cars.<p class="message sent">Alright, we need to position them carefully in the cargo hold. Do you have any experience with this?<p class=message>Yeah, I move heavy loads all day long, so I'm familiar with the drill. Just tell me where you want them.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Let's start with the red Ferrari over there.<p class=message>Got it. I'll be careful not to scratch it!<p class="message sent">Good to hear. And after we're done with this load, do you want to grab lunch together?<p class=message>Sounds great to me. Do you have a favorite restaurant here in the airport?<p class="message sent">Yeah, there's a sushi bar that's always great. Let's go there.<p class=message>Sure thing. Thanks for offering to treat me.<p class="message sent">No problem, you deserve it. Without you, I don't think I could have lifted these cars onto the plane.<p class=message>(laughing) I think I've found a new calling as a cargo assistant!<p class="message sent">Who knows, maybe one day you'll get your pilot's license and fly cargo planes yourself.<p class=message>(jokingly) I'll start with toy planes and work my way up from there.<p class="message sent">(laughing) I think you'll do just fine. Let's finish up with these cars, and then we'll grab some sushi.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a2d6697e-153b-41d1-9178-bdcd7fbde20b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
