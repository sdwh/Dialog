Are you ready for another day of serving delicious local food?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! This little snack shop in the heart of Wanhua district is a gem. I am always excited to come here.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Today we have a special treat for our customers - our signature dish, pig's feet vermicelli! It's a crowd favorite and a must-try for everyone who visits.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! What makes our dish unique compared to others?<p class=message>We slow-cook our pig's feet for hours to make it tender, and our vermicelli is made fresh every day. Plus, we add our special blend of spices that adds flavor to the broth.<p class="message sent">Yum! I can already imagine the aroma of the dish. What else do we have on the menu today?<p class=message>We also have pineapple cakes, which are a popular dessert in Taiwan. Our pastry chef made them fresh this morning, so they'll be super tasty!<p class="message sent">You're making me hungry already! By the way, I noticed that we have a lot of tourists coming in these days. Do we have an English menu that we can offer them?<p class=message>Of course! I actually made one last night. It includes our popular dishes and a brief explanation of each one. I'm sure our English-speaking customers will appreciate it.<p class="message sent">Perfect! That's very thoughtful of you. Alright, I think we're all set for another busy day.<p class=message>Let's do this! I'm excited to see our customers' satisfied faces after tasting our food.<p class="message sent">That's why we do what we do. To make people happy through their stomachs!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fb47d341-df9d-4948-b811-2097826052e1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
