It's a bit of a journey, do you have any plans for the day once we get there?<p class=message>I'm meeting some friends for lunch in South Bank, how about you?<p class="message sent">Just planning on exploring the city a bit, maybe grab a coffee or two. Have you ever been to Brisbane before?<p class=message>Yes, I was here last year for a conference. But I only had time for work-related events, so I didn't get to see much of the city.<p class="message sent">Well, I'm sure you'll enjoy your time here. It's a great place to be.<p class=message>I've heard the food scene is amazing, any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Oh, there's so much to choose from! But if you're after a good steak, I highly recommend the Norman Hotel.<p class=message>Thanks for the tip! I'll definitely check it out. Do you have a favorite spot in Brisbane?<p class="message sent">I would have to say Kangaroo Point, the view of the city from there is just breathtaking.<p class=message>That sounds wonderful, I might have to add that to my itinerary. Do you have any interesting stories from your time driving taxis in Brisbane?<p class="message sent">Well, I once had a passenger who left their pet snake in the back seat! Needless to say, I was a little surprised when I found it.<p class=message>(laughs) That's definitely a unique experience. Hopefully, we won't have any unexpected surprises on our trip today!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Fingers crossed! We should be there in about 30 minutes.<p class=message>Perfect, thanks for the company and the great conversation.<p class="message sent">Pleasure was all mine. Have a great time in Brisbane!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8bd7d105-fe75-4d71-a1a4-cb2208a2986f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
