How about you?<p class=message>I'm actually feeling a bit nervous. This is my first time in Manila.<p class="message sent">No worries, I've been driving in Manila for years now. I'll get you to your destination safely.<p class=message>That's reassuring. So, where would you recommend I go to experience the local culture?<p class="message sent">Well, you can visit the walled city of Intramuros, it's pretty popular among tourists. Or if you're up for a more adventurous experience, why not try the street food in the night market of Quiapo?<p class=message>Oh, I love street food! What are some must-try dishes?<p class="message sent">You have to try the balut, it's a boiled fertilized duck egg. Don't be put off by the appearance; it's actually delicious.<p class=message>(Laughs) That sounds interesting. I'll be sure to try it.<p class="message sent">You should also try the halo-halo for dessert; it's a mix of shaved ice, tropical fruit, and sweet beans, topped with milk and ice cream.<p class=message>Yum! I love anything sweet. Thanks for the recommendations.<p class="message sent">No problem. Have you planned what you'll do while in Manila?<p class=message>Well, I'm thinking of going to the beaches in Boracay, but other than that, I haven't really planned anything else.<p class="message sent">Boracay is a great choice; the white sand beaches are stunning. But you should also consider exploring the museums and galleries in Manila, there's a lot of art and culture to see.<p class=message>I didn't realize Manila had so much to offer. Thanks for the tips, I'll definitely check them out.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. We're almost at your destination, enjoy your stay in Manila!<p class=message>Thank you, you've been a great driver and a great tour guide.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7f16993f-23d3-4b0f-9f2a-f5ec497be3ff.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
