As an IT consultant, what do you suggest?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, I was just thinking about it. We could use some software to extract data from the contracts and develop a template.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. But how do we make sure the software will be able to identify the necessary information?<p class="message sent">We could use machine learning algorithms to train it. It will take some time, but it will be able to recognize patterns and understand the content.<p class=message>That sounds like a great plan. But wait, what about legal jargons? Will it be able to understand those?<p class="message sent">Haha, good point. We could use NLP to teach it the meaning of legal terms. Don't worry; we have everything under control.<p class=message>I'm impressed. This is going to save a lot of time and effort for the firm. But what about security? How do we make sure the data is not breached?<p class="message sent">We could implement proper encryption and secure data storage. As a software engineer, I make sure security is never compromised.<p class=message>Excellent! By the way, what do you think about naming the software? Can't call it just "Contract management tool."<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about "The Contractinator"? Just kidding, let's leave it to the marketing team.<p class=message>Haha, that's funny. Well, it's been a pleasure working with you, B. Thanks for your help.<p class="message sent">Same here! Now let's go and grab some lunch; I'm starving.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=32bfe61d-3e36-41dc-87f8-029a1573d6c6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
