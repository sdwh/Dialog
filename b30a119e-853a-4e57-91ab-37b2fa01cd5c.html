What's that?<p class=message>It's a standard for Information Security management. Specifically, it's about how to respond to incidents in case they happen.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds boring.<p class=message>Actually, it's not. It's pretty interesting.<p class="message sent">Really? How so?<p class=message>Well, it's like preparing for a zombie invasion. You don't want to wait until they're already at your door, right?<p class="message sent">Haha, I see your point. So, how do we become prepared?<p class=message>First, we need to identify our risks and create a response plan.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. I don't want to be caught off guard.<p class=message>Definitely not. Remember, the early bird gets the worm.<p class="message sent">Okay, okay. So what do we do after we've identified our risks?<p class=message>We establish an incident response team and train them on how to respond.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. So like a security guard?<p class=message>Yes, kind of like that. The team should be the first line of defense in case of any security issues.<p class="message sent">Got it. And then what happens?<p class=message>We test the plan to make sure it works properly. Like a fire drill, but for security.<p class="message sent">Ooh, that sounds cool. Can we have an actual drill too? With loud alarms and everything?<p class=message>Haha, I don't know about the alarms, but sure! It's important to make sure everyone knows what to do in case of an emergency.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, what happens if we do have an incident?<p class=message>That's when the response plan kicks into gear. The team follows the plan and we start the investigation process.<p class="message sent">Investigation? Like Sherlock Holmes?<p class=message>Haha, not exactly. But we do need to find out what happened, who's responsible, and how to prevent it from happening again in the future.<p class="message sent">Okay, I think I got it. But wait, what if it's a major incident? Like a data breach?<p class=message>Well, then we need to escalate it to higher management and involve external agencies if necessary.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a lot of work. But I guess it's better than the alternative, right?<p class=message>Absolutely! Prevention is key when it comes to information security. So, are you ready to become an incident response expert now?<p class="message sent">Haha, maybe not an expert, but I'm definitely more interested now!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b308501f-1097-45d9-a648-8dc2e3ecf9c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
