It's great to see you in class today. How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It was pretty busy. I went hiking with some friends on Saturday and then spent Sunday catching up on some homework. How was your weekend?<p class=message>Sounds like a perfect balance of fun and productivity. I spent most of my time grading papers, but I did take a break to watch a movie with my family.<p class="message sent">What movie did you watch?<p class=message>We watched the new Pixar film, "Onward." It's about two elf brothers who go on a quest to spend one more day with their deceased father. It's really heartwarming.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting! I haven't seen any new movies lately, but I did binge-watch a new show on Netflix called "Stranger Things." Have you seen it?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's one of my favorite shows. Did you finish the entire series?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! I couldn't stop watching it. I'm counting down the days until the next season comes out.<p class=message>Haha, I know the feeling. Speaking of counting down, we have a midterm exam next week. Have you started studying yet?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been reviewing my notes and trying to do some practice problems. I'm a little nervous, though.<p class=message>Don't worry, B. You've been doing great in class so far. Just keep practicing and you'll do fine. If you need any extra help, feel free to come to my office hours.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I appreciate the offer.<p class=message>No problem, B. That's what I'm here for. Okay, let's get started on today's lesson. We're going to be learning about conditional statements.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=131c552f-a4cb-4544-a967-b4708170d431.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
