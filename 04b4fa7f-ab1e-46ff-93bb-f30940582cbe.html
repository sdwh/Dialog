Do you know if they come with any sort of condiments or sauces?<p class="message sent message-content">From what I remember, they provide ketchup and mayo packets.<p class="message received message-content">Cool, thanks for the heads up! By the way, have you explored the gym yet?<p class="message sent message-content">Actually, I haven't yet. Have you been there already?<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, I went for a quick workout earlier. They have a pretty decent selection of equipment.<p class="message sent message-content">I might have to check it out after I get settled into my room. Speaking of which, have you seen what kind of toiletries they provide?<p class="message received message-content">Yep, they have shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in little bottles. They even have some lotion, too.<p class="message sent message-content">Nice, I hate when hotels don't include lotion. Do they also have any towels?<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, they have a set of towels in the bathroom already, and there are some extras stored in the closet.<p class="message sent message-content">Perfect! I can't stand it when hotels don't provide enough towels.<p class="message received message-content">Definitely, it's always the little things that make a hotel stay more enjoyable.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=04b4af72-5176-4f30-9425-86ed28622dc5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
