I recently had it and it was amazing!<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I have tried it before. Lomo Saltado is a popular dish from Peru, right?<p class=message>That's right! It's a delicious mix of stir-fried beef, onions, tomatoes, and french fries, topped with aji sauce.<p class="message sent">Oh boy, it sounds like a dish that's rich in flavors. Did you have it with rice?<p class=message>Actually, no. I went for the classic way of having it with fries, as it adds a nice crunch to the dish.<p class="message sent">I see. I have heard that it's a quick and easy meal to make at home. Do you think you'll be trying to make it yourself anytime soon?<p class=message>That's the plan! I did some research and it seems like a fun and easy recipe. Plus, I can add my own twist to it and make it even more enjoyable.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Who knows, maybe one day we'll both have our own versions of Lomo Saltado and have a taste test?<p class=message>That's a fantastic idea! Let's make it happen. We can even have our own cook-off.<p class="message sent">I'm all in for that! We can invite friends and make it a fun night of trying out different recipes of Lomo Saltado.<p class=message>Count me in too! I'm excited to try making this dish and have a fun cook-off with you.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. When should we schedule it?<p class=message>How about next weekend? That gives us enough time to prepare, and we can all gather together for a fun-filled evening of Lomo Saltado.<p class="message sent">Perfect! Can't wait to see what you come up with.<p class=message>Challenge accepted. Let the cook-off begin!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=873520e8-b636-411d-b78c-05506281128c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
