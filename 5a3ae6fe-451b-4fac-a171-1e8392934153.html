Do you need anything to make you more comfortable?<p class="message sent">No, I think I'm good for now. Can I ask you something?<p class=message>Of course, what can I help you with?<p class="message sent">How many people do you think you have helped in your career as a nurse?<p class=message>Hmm, I'm not sure. But I think it's safe to say that it's been a lot. It's definitely a rewarding job though.<p class="message sent">Yes, I can imagine. Do you have any crazy stories from your job?<p class=message>Oh, I have a few! One time, a patient accidentally swallowed a key and we had to retrieve it. Another time, a patient tried to sneak out by hiding under a blanket, but we caught him.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's crazy. I hope I don't give you any trouble like that.<p class=message>Oh, don't worry about that. We are here to help you get better and make you as comfortable as possible.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem at all. Just let me know if you need anything else, okay?<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks again.<p class=message>You're welcome.
