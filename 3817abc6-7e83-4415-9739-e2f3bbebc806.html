How have you been?<p class=message>I'm good. So, how's your sister doing?<p class="message sent">She's doing well, thanks for asking. She's been busy with work lately.<p class=message>What does she do for work?<p class="message sent">She's a graphic designer at an ad agency.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds cool. Does she like her job?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I think she does. She's always been really creative.<p class=message>That's great. So, what do you feel like ordering for lunch?<p class="message sent">I'm thinking of getting the salad. What about you?<p class=message>Hmm, I might get the sandwich. Oh, and I know my sister loves this place too.<p class="message sent">Really? Maybe we should invite her to join us next time.<p class=message>Good idea!

That's so awesome.<p class=message>Yeah, she's definitely multi-talented. I always admire her for that.<p class="message sent">Me too.
