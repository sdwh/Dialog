Have you driven many people there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've lost count. It's a great city, full of history and many things to see.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What do you think is the best place to visit?<p class="message sent">Well, it depends on what you're interested in. If you like history, the Forbidden City and Great Wall are must-sees.<p class=message>I definitely want to see those. What about food? I've heard Beijing has some amazing dishes.<p class="message sent">Peking duck is a classic, but there are also many street food options like jianbing and baozi that are delicious.<p class=message>Yum, it all sounds amazing. How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for over 10 years. It's been a great job for me.<p class=message>Do you have any funny or interesting stories from your time driving?<p class="message sent">One time, a couple got into a fight in the backseat and things got pretty heated. But by the end of the ride, they were laughing and making up.<p class=message>That's quite a story! Thanks for sharing. How much longer until we get to Beijing?<p class="message sent">We should be there in about 30 minutes. Is there anything else you'd like to know or see in the city?<p class=message>Not right now, but thanks for the tips. I'm excited to explore Beijing!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, enjoy your stay!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=164143ac-94e6-40f3-aaa8-08cec9a2e81b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
