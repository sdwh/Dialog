What do they want now?<p class=message>They want us to build in a feature that we've already told them won't be possible. It's like they're speaking a different language.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Maybe we should start a new profession as translators of client speak.<p class=message>(laughs) That might not be such a bad idea. But, on a serious note, I think we could offer them an alternative solution that still meets their needs.<p class="message sent">Good point. We could also send them a quick mock-up to show what we have in mind.<p class=message>Exactly. And if nothing else, it will be a good way to show them that we're still on top of things and working to meet their requirements.<p class="message sent">Hey A, speaking of requirements, I need your help on this coding problem. I can't seem to figure out where my code is going wrong.<p class=message>Sure, let's take a look. (pauses to examine the code) Oh, I see what the issue is. You're missing a semi-colon at the end of this line.<p class="message sent">(facepalms) Of course! Thanks for catching that.<p class=message>No worries. We're a team, and we all help each other out.<p class="message sent">(smiling) That's what makes this job so great. We have a great team and we all work together to tackle the challenges that come our way.<p class=message>(nodding) Absolutely. And I know we'll have this project wrapped up in no time, despite the challenges.<p class="message sent">(smiling) That's the spirit! Let's get to work and show our client what we're made of.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2eab720d-596d-4311-99a3-f3a15b7141c8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
