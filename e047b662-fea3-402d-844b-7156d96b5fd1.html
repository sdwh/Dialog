I heard you're on a mission to find a missing magician.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's true. It's quite a challenging task, but I am up for it.<p class=message>Well, lucky for you, you've got a talented Elf Archer like me to help you out!<p class="message sent">That's right. Your sharp eyesight and quick reflexes will be very helpful in this mission.<p class=message>So, where do we start?<p class="message sent">We must visit all of the magic shops and taverns in the area. There's a chance he might have been seen in one of those places.<p class=message>Sounds like a good plan. But what if we don't find any leads?<p class="message sent">In that case, we'll have to expand our search area and start questioning the locals.<p class=message>Ah, yes. I'm always up for a good chat with the townsfolk.<p class="message sent">And I'll be sure to keep an eye out for any suspicious characters.<p class=message>Speaking of suspicious characters, have you heard about that group of bandits that have been roaming around lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They're notorious for causing trouble in the area.<p class=message>Hmm, do you think they might have something to do with the missing magician?<p class="message sent">It's possible. We can't rule anything out.<p class=message>Well, if they do cross our path, I'm ready to take them down with my bow and arrows!<p class="message sent">And I'll be right behind you, ready to unleash my sword and shield.<p class=message>(laughs) With the two of us, those bandits won't stand a chance!<p class="message sent">That's the spirit! Let's focus on finding that magician first, and worry about the bandits later.<p class=message>Agreed. (pauses) Hey, do you hear that?<p class="message sent">(listens closely) Sounds like someone's in trouble.
