I'm really excited to try out your restaurant. Can you recommend a great main course?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Our chef's special is the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. It's a favorite among our regulars.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! How about wine? What would you recommend to pair with the salmon?<p class="message sent">Well, for seafood dishes my personal favorite is a nice crisp white wine. We have a great Sauvignon Blanc that complements the salmon's flavors really well.<p class=message>Hmm, that sounds tempting. But I'm more of a red wine kind of person. What do you suggest for a red wine option?<p class="message sent">No problem at all! Our house red is a smooth and mellow Merlot. It goes great with the salmon and also pairs well with our steak dishes.<p class=message>That sounds perfect! I'll go with the grilled salmon and a glass of Merlot please. Can you also recommend a dessert to finish off the meal?<p class="message sent">Of course! Our cheesecake is a customer favorite. It's light and creamy with a graham cracker crust. It's the perfect dessert to end your meal.<p class=message>You're making my mouth water just thinking about it! I'll definitely have to try the cheesecake. Thank you for your recommendations.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a3aa5bc3-cf1d-4d06-9856-75b4a2022bbb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
