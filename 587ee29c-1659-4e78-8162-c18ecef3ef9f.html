How's the dough coming along?<p class="message sent">Hey there! I'm whipping up some fresh soy milk as we speak. Got any hot off the griddle goodies for me?<p class=message>Just pulled a batch of crispy and flaky shaobing out of the oven. Want to try one?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'll pour you a cup of fragrant soy milk to go with that. Nothing beats the combination of shaobing and doujiang in the morning.<p class=message>Ah, thank you kindly! You're right, it's a match made in breakfast heaven. Speaking of which, have you ever tried stuffing the shaobing with anything other than meat?<p class="message sent">Funny you should ask. I've been toying with the idea of stuffing them with sweet fillings like red bean paste or custard. What do you think?<p class=message>Sounds like a delicious twist on the classic. Count me in for a taste test! Do you think the customers around here will go for it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! The locals love trying new things, and they always appreciate the authenticity of our traditional Chinese breakfast offerings.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Speaking of which, have you had any interesting encounters with customers lately?<p class="message sent">You know, we had a group of tourists in here last week who had never tried doujiang before. We ended up convincing them to take a sip, and they loved it so much they ordered seconds!<p class=message>That's the power of a good doujiang. I'm glad we could introduce it to some new fans. Hey, speaking of customers, it looks like we have a line forming. Ready to get breakfast rolling?<p class="message sent">You bet. Here's to a busy and fun morning serving up some of the best Chinese breakfast in town!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=58745391-a9c3-44a0-adda-c7e5a7bbb307.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
