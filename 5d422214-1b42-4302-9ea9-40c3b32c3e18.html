How's business today?<p class="message sent">Hey A! It's pretty good. How's the hotdog stand doing?<p class=message>We got a lot of hungry customers today! And it's so hot outside, they're definitely in the mood for something cold to go along with their hotdogs.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's scorching out here! Good thing we have our icy treats to cool everyone down.<p class=message>Absolutely. By the way, have you tried our new chili cheese hotdog yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet! What makes it so special?<p class=message>Well, the hotdog itself is extra juicy and flavorful, and then we add a rich bean chili on top with melted cheddar cheese. It's definitely a must-try.<p class="message sent">Yum, that does sound amazing. I'll have to order one for myself later.<p class=message>Definitely do! Oh, and I see you have a new flavor of shaved ice. What's the flavor of the day?<p class="message sent">It's strawberry mango! It's been a hit so far, people can't get enough. Want to try some?<p class=message>Sure, why not? *takes a spoonful* Mmm, that's really delicious! The combination of the two fruits is perfect.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it! Hey, maybe we should think about doing some kind of combo deal for our two stands.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can advertise a discount for a hotdog and a medium shaved ice together.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. Let's get started on that right away!<p class=message>Agreed. It's always fun working with you, B.<p class="message sent">Same here, A. It's nice to have someone to collaborate with in this hot and hectic business!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5d401335-cb5a-41e7-bfc7-cdb586b442e0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
