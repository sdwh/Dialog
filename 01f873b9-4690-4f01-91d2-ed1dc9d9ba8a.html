Where are you headed?<p class=message>I'm headed to Australia Cairns. Do you know the way?<p class="message sent">Of course, I've been driving people around Cairns for years. It's a beautiful place. Have you ever been there before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time. I'm excited to explore the city, and hopefully do some scuba diving.<p class="message sent">Sounds like fun! Cairns is a great place for scuba diving, you'll love it. Are you traveling alone?<p class=message>Yes, I'm traveling alone. I haven't been on a solo trip in a while, so I'm looking forward to it.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. Sometimes it's nice to just get away and have some alone time. Are you from around here?<p class=message>No, I'm from Taiwan.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's quite a distance! What brings you to Cairns?<p class=message>I've always wanted to visit Australia and Cairns was at the top of my list. The Great Barrier Reef, the Daintree Rainforest, and the wildlife all seem amazing.<p class="message sent">You definitely won't be disappointed. Are you staying for a few days or longer?<p class=message>I'll be staying for a week. I have a packed itinerary, but if you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.<p class="message sent">There's so much to do in Cairns, but if you have time, you should visit Palm Cove. It's a beautiful beach town just north of Cairns. Also, don't forget to try some seafood while you're here.<p class=message>Thank you for the recommendations. I'll make sure to check them out.<p class="message sent">Not a problem. Have a great time in Cairns!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=01f285a8-4fe6-4de4-b919-0900718d5a5a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
