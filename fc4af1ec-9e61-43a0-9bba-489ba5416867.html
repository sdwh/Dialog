Welcome to the beautiful city of Paris. My name is Sarah, and I'll be your tour guide for the day. How's your stay in Paris so far?<p class="message sent">Hi Sarah! Thank you, Paris has been amazing so far. The Eiffel Tower was breathtaking.<p class=message>Great to know! Just to give you a brief, we'll visit the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Palace of Versailles today. Are you excited?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I've heard so much about these places, and I can't wait to explore them.<p class=message>That's fantastic! Speaking of the Louvre Museum, did you know that it's the most visited museum in the world?<p class="message sent">Really? That's impressive. How long would we spend there?<p class=message>We'll be there for two hours, and you'll have the chance to see the famous Mona Lisa painting.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's amazing. I've always wanted to see it in person.<p class=message>Our next stop is the Notre-Dame Cathedral, which took over 200 years to construct. It's a gothic masterpiece.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting! Is it still under construction?<p class=message>Unfortunately, it is. But don't worry, we can still appreciate its beauty from the outside. And who knows, we might even see Quasimodo swinging around.<p class="message sent">Haha, that would be cool! And what about the Palace of Versailles?<p class=message>It was the residence of the Kings of France and boasts of luxury and opulence. You'll see the magnificent Hall of Mirrors and the beautiful gardens.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a grand day out. Thank you for showing us around, Sarah.<p class=message>It's my pleasure! And don't forget to try some French pastries while you're here. They're divine.<p class="message sent">Will do! Thank you, Sarah.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fc49019b-879c-46f8-a982-020ca7c121b0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
