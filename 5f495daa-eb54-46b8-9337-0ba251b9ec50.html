I'm a bit lost.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'd be happy to help. Where are you transferring to today?<p class=message>I'm headed to Boston, but I have a layover in New York. Do I need to collect my baggage and re-check it in?<p class="message sent">No need to worry, we will transfer your baggage for you. All you need to do is follow the signs to your next gate and enjoy the airport.<p class=message>That's a relief. I always get anxious about my luggage.<p class="message sent">We understand the feeling, but rest assured that we take good care of all belongings. Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>Actually, I was wondering if there are any good places to grab a bite to eat during my layover.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! There are some great restaurants around, from quick bites to sit-down meals. Do you have a preference?<p class=message>I'd love to try something local to New York, something that's unique to this city.<p class="message sent">In that case, you might want to check out Shake Shack or Nathan's Famous for their famous hot dogs. They're both very popular with locals.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds perfect. I'll definitely give them a try. Thank you for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Have a safe trip and enjoy your layover!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5f44e4b1-ab0e-4ac1-a187-731f26b7fe2b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
