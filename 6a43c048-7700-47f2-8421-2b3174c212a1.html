Of course, let's take a look at your grades and see how you're doing.<p class=message>Well, for starters, I'm really proud of my improvement in math. I used to really struggle with it, but I've been studying a lot and I got a B on my last test!<p class="message sent">That's fantastic! It's always great to see our hard work paying off. What else has been going well for you?<p class=message>My English class is also going pretty well, but I feel like I still have a lot of room for improvement.<p class="message sent">As long as you keep working at it, I'm confident you'll continue to see progress there. Have you been doing any extra study outside of class?<p class=message>Yeah, I've been watching English TV shows and reading more in my free time. It's been helping me a lot.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Keep it up. Is there anything you're still struggling with that we can work on?<p class=message>I've been having some trouble with taking notes during lectures. It seems like I can never write down everything that's important.<p class="message sent">Taking good notes can definitely be a challenge. Let's work together on some strategies to help you out.<p class=message>That sounds great. Thanks, counselor!<p class="message sent">Of course! That's what I'm here for. Don't hesitate to come back whenever you need some extra help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6a400e32-39fb-4ed7-9cfa-414e6c45c352.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
