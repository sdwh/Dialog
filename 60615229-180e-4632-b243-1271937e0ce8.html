Just busy making some fresh croissants and macarons. How about you?<p class=message>Same here, I'm making some chocolate truffles and pralines.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! Say, I'm always curious about the process of making chocolate. Could you share some tips with me?<p class=message>Sure thing! It's all about the tempering process. You have to heat and cool the chocolate just right to get that perfect snap and shine.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. I'll have to try that next time. How about for croissants? Any secrets there?<p class=message>Definitely! Cold butter is the key to achieving those flaky layers. And don't forget to let the dough rest for at least an hour in between folds.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! You really know your stuff. By the way, have you heard about the new dessert shop opening down the street?<p class=message>I have! I'm excited to check it out. They specialize in éclairs, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, I heard they're doing some unique flavors too, like lavender and blackberry.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. Maybe we should collaborate with them for a special dessert event.<p class="message sent">Great idea! We could showcase our best chocolate and pastries. Let's talk more about it after our shift.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. By the way, have you tried the new coffee blend from that café next door?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've been meaning to. Have you?<p class=message>Yes, it's quite good. We should grab a cup after work and catch up on the latest dessert trends.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. I'm always down for some coffee and pastry talk.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=60603547-6a8c-42e7-9a1c-035308510379.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
