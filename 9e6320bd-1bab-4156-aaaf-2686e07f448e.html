You must be the food delivery guy. I'm Chef A. Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi Chef A, nice to meet you too. I'm Delivery Man B. I've got a bunch of deliveries for you today.<p class=message>Great! Let's get to work then. I've got a lot to cook up in the kitchen.<p class="message sent">You're not kidding. It looks like you're running a full-time operation in there.<p class=message>Yeah, we're pretty busy. We've got to keep the customers happy, right?<p class="message sent">That's for sure. I don't want to disappoint anyone. Everything looks freshly prepared and ready to go.<p class=message>Thanks, we take pride in our work here. What's your favorite food to deliver?<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough question. I'd say I love delivering fresh seafood to the local restaurants.<p class=message>Ah, we can't go wrong with seafood in Texas. Have you been able to try any of the local cuisine while you've been delivering?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I've had some great barbecue and Tex-Mex. I'm definitely gaining weight with all this good food around!<p class=message>(laughs) I know what you mean. We have to be careful ourselves, being around all this food all day.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'll make sure to work off all those extra calories with all the deliveries I have to make!<p class=message>(laughs) Sounds like a plan! Thanks for all your hard work today. See you next time.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Chef A. It's always a pleasure working with you. Good luck with all the cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e604292-f207-4ad3-a9b7-1258722e43b0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
