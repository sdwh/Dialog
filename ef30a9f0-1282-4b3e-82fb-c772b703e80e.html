May I ask you for some advice on a baggage handling issue that we've had recently?<p class="message sent">Of course, miss! What seems to be the problem?<p class=message>Well, we've noticed that some passengers' bags are getting misplaced between connecting flights. We were wondering if there's anything we can do to improve the process.<p class="message sent">Yes, that can definitely be an issue. One suggestion would be to implement a better tracking system for bags, so that they don't get lost in transit.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Do you have any specific recommendations for a tracking system?<p class="message sent">Well, one option would be to use RFID tags on the bags, which can be read by scanners throughout the journey.<p class=message>I see! That sounds like a really effective solution. Do you think it would be possible for us to implement that system in the near future?<p class="message sent">It might take some time and investment, but ultimately it would be worth it for the improvement in customer satisfaction and streamlined operations.<p class=message>I completely agree! Thank you so much for your help and advice.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, happy to assist in any way we can. Have a great day, miss!<p class=message>You too, sir! Thanks again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ef2e67af-28e6-4132-844e-29eda3b3c657.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
