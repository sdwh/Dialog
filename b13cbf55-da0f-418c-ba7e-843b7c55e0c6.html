I heard you're working on a new mobile game. What's it all about?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Yes, I am! It's a puzzle game that involves matching block patterns to progress through levels.<p class=message>Oh, I love puzzle games! Is it anything like Tetris?<p class="message sent">It's similar, but with a twist. The blocks come in different shapes and colors, making it a bit more challenging.<p class=message>Sounds interesting! What's it called?<p class="message sent">Right now, we're calling it "Block Party." But we haven't settled on a final name yet.<p class=message>What's the inspiration behind the game?<p class="message sent">Well, we wanted to create a game that was both fun and mentally stimulating. Plus, we noticed there aren't many puzzle games out there that include different colored blocks.<p class=message>That's true! What devices will it be available on?<p class="message sent">It'll be available on both iOS and Android devices. We're hoping to release it in about two months.<p class=message>Awesome! Can't wait to try it out. How long did it take you to develop it?<p class="message sent">It's been in development for about six months now. We've had to tweak a lot of the game mechanics to make sure it was both challenging and enjoyable.<p class=message>I bet it wasn't easy! Are there any special power-ups or bonuses in the game?<p class="message sent">Yes, there are a few. We have a bomb block that destroys a whole row of blocks, and a color bomb that matches with any block of the same color.<p class=message>Cool! I think this game is going to be a hit. Can I beta test it for you?<p class="message sent">Of course! I'd love your feedback. I'll send you a link to download the beta version when it's ready. Thanks, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b1373b7b-a4c5-4384-87e4-867673c98dd5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
