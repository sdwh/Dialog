How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too, thanks. By the way, our egg tarts yesterday were a hit!<p class="message sent">Yes, I noticed that too. They sold out within an hour. I'm glad customers like them.<p class=message>Definitely, we should make more today. And speaking of new items, any ideas for today's menu?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about mango sago for dessert? It's perfect for this hot weather.<p class=message>That's a great suggestion! Let's add it to the menu. And for the main dish, how about pork buns?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I'll start preparing the mango sago while you get the ingredients for the pork buns.<p class=message>Got it. Oh, do you need any help with the sago?<p class="message sent">No, I can handle it. But can you help me taste test the sweetness level?<p class=message>Of course! It's one of my favorite desserts anyway.<p class="message sent">Great, let's work on that after we finish the pork buns.<p class=message>On another note, have you tried the new bubble tea place down the street?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did last week. But honestly, our milk tea is still better. What do you think?<p class=message>I agree, our milk tea is definitely unbeatable. And speaking of drinks, should we offer some iced lemon tea today as well?<p class="message sent">I think that's a good idea. It's a refreshing drink that goes well with savory dishes.<p class=message>Perfect, we're really on the same wavelength today! Oh, and before I forget, we need to order more tapioca pearls and red bean paste.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll take care of that. Is there anything else we need to restock?<p class=message>We still have some egg custard filling left, but let's order more just in case.<p class="message sent">No problem. I'll place the order once we're done with the preparation.<p class=message>Great, we make a great team, B! Customers will love our authentic Hong Kong-style dim sum and desserts today.<p class="message sent">I agree, A! I'm excited for today's service. Let's do our best!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=161ee1c5-6c6b-4954-b459-d15a28f58a1d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
