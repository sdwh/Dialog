How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well too. We have a surgery scheduled for today. Do you have everything ready?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have all the instruments sterilized and the patient is prepped and ready for surgery. Do you need anything else from me?<p class=message>No, you've done a great job. By the way, have you heard about the new coffee shop that just opened around the corner?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class=message>It's called 'Coffee on the Go'. They serve the best coffee in town.<p class="message sent">Wow, sounds interesting. Maybe we can drop by after work today.<p class=message>That's a great idea. And speaking of coffee, do you remember the time we had to do a surgery on a patient who had too much caffeine intake?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I remember that. The patient was so jittery and restless during the surgery.<p class=message>It was quite a challenge, but we managed to complete the surgery successfully. That's what teamwork is all about.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of teamwork, do you need me to assist you during the surgery?<p class=message>Yes, please. I value your expertise and skills in the operating room.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Doctor A. I'm ready when you are. Let's go save some lives!<p class=message>That's the spirit! Let's make it a great surgery.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f8a2fb05-3035-4485-8bdb-844230e43caf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
