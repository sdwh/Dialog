It's great to have you with us today. I heard you're an experienced red braised pork chef?<p class="message sent">Yes, I specialize in Chinese-style red-braised pork but I'm eager to learn how to make the Thai version.<p class=message>Excellent, let's get to it then. First, we need to prepare the pork belly. Would you like to do the honors?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! So we'll need to clean it first and then marinate it with fish sauce, soy sauce, palm sugar, cinnamon, star anise and garlic, right?<p class=message>Absolutely! That's the foundation for our flavors. Now, let's move on to the sauce. We use tamarind paste, chili paste, coriander root, and garlic to create a perfect balance of sweet, sour and spicy.<p class="message sent">Got it. And how about the sides? What goes with Thai red-braised pork?<p class=message>We usually serve it with stir-fried morning glory, some steamed jasmine rice, a spicy papaya salad and some pickled cucumbers.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like such a fresh and vibrant combination of flavors. Can't wait to try it!<p class=message>Me too! I'm sure your version of this dish will be a hit among our customers. Remember to make it spicy but not too spicy!<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'll get it just right. And if it's anything like my Chinese-style red-braised pork, it'll be finger-licking good!<p class=message>Ha ha ha! I have no doubt about that. I'm really impressed by your culinary skills and passion for food.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! It's always a pleasure to learn about new cuisines and share my own knowledge and experience with others.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. It's amazing how food brings people together and allows us to connect and explore different cultures. Thank you again for joining us today.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Let's get cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e9f9bf09-98f8-4d1a-8b4f-ac5805289463.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
