How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hi, thanks for asking. I'm feeling better than yesterday, but still not 100%.<p class=message>I see. Well, we'll make sure to take good care of you. Have you had breakfast yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I had some oatmeal and a banana. Do you have any coffee?<p class=message>Of course! Let me go grab you a cup.<p class="message sent">Thank you. So, do you always work in the hospital?<p class=message>Yes, I've been a nurse here for about five years now. It's definitely a challenging job, but also very rewarding.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. It must be tough dealing with sick people all day.<p class=message>It can be emotionally draining, but it's also amazing to be able to help people when they're at their most vulnerable.<p class="message sent">That's really admirable. I'm so grateful for all the care I'm receiving here.<p class=message>It's our pleasure. We're just doing our job. So tell me, what do you like to do for fun when you're not in the hospital?<p class="message sent">Well, I love to read and watch movies. And I also play guitar.<p class=message>That's cool! What kind of music do you play?<p class="message sent">Mostly classic rock and blues. It's a good stress reliever for me.<p class=message>I bet! Well, if you need anything else, just press the call button and I'll be right back.<p class="message sent">Thanks so much, you've been really helpful.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ff6cb171-ddcf-45dc-9d73-4e1147c393e6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
