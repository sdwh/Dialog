What can I get for you?<p class=message>Hmm, I think I'll make myself a margarita. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'll just stick to my usual, a cold bottle of beer.<p class=message>You know, I actually heard an interesting fact about beer earlier. Did you know that it's the third most popular drink in the world, after water and tea?<p class="message sent">Really? I guess everyone loves a good cold one.<p class=message>Speaking of cold ones, have you ever tried a beer cocktail?<p class="message sent">Can't say that I have. What's in it?<p class=message>Well, there's the classic shandy, which is beer mixed with lemonade. But there are also some more unique ones like a Guinness float or a lovely beer sangria.<p class="message sent">Wow, I'll definitely have to try one of those. So, what's the craziest drink request you've ever had?<p class=message>Oh man, where do I even start? I once had a customer ask for a cocktail with bacon-infused vodka and pickled okra juice.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That sounds like a a recipe for a bad hangover.<p class=message>No kidding. But hey, we're in Texas, where bigger is better, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Speaking of big, those chicken wings we just served up were massive!<p class=message>Yeah, those are definitely a hit. I'm thinking we need to add some more spicy options to the menu.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And maybe we can even do a wing-eating contest for our customers.<p class=message>(laughs) That would be amazing. We better start prepping some extra napkins though.<p class="message sent">Good idea. Here's your margarita, cheers!<p class=message>Cheers, and thank you!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b399469b-3e08-427d-9889-389f4074f7c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
