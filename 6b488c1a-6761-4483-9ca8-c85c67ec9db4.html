It's good to see you again.<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It's been a while. What's new?<p class=message>Well, I've been working on a new short story. I wanted to get your opinion on it.<p class="message sent">Of course, I would love to read it. What's it about?<p class=message>It's a comedic piece about a group of dogs who start a detective agency.<p class="message sent">(chuckles) That sounds entertaining. I'm looking forward to reading it.<p class=message>Thanks! I just need to make sure it's polished and error-free before I send it to any publishers.<p class="message sent">No worries, that's what I'm here for. Let's start reviewing your work.<p class=message>Great. I appreciate your help. What do you think of the opening scene?<p class="message sent">Hmm, it's good, but I think it could use more action. Maybe the dogs could be chasing after a squirrel or something.<p class=message>(laughs) That's a great idea. I'll add that in.<p class="message sent">And what about the dialogue? Is it realistic?<p class=message>I think so, but I'm not sure. Would you mind reading it out loud with me?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. (reads) "We need to find the lost toy. It's our duty as dog detectives."<p class=message>(laughs) Okay, maybe it's a bit cheesy.<p class="message sent">It's okay to have a little cheese! It adds to the humor of the story.<p class=message>You're right. I'll leave it in. Thank you, B. Your input is invaluable.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. That's what friends and editors are for.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b44d2c7-8962-480e-ad8d-b089f5f60b63.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
