Do you know why I pulled you over?<p class="message sent">No, I don't. Was I speeding?<p class=message>Actually, your taillight is out. Can I see your driver's license and registration, please?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, officer. Here you go.<p class=message>Thank you. Is this your current address on your license?<p class="message sent">No, it's not. I recently moved, and I haven't had the chance to update it yet.<p class=message>Okay. Please make sure to update it as soon as possible. In the meantime, I'll let you off with a warning for the taillight. Just be sure to get it fixed soon.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, officer. I appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem. Are you from around here?<p class="message sent">No, actually. I'm just visiting from Sydney.<p class=message>Ah, well, welcome to Adelaide. Have you tried any of the local food yet?<p class="message sent">I haven't had the chance yet, but I'm looking forward to it. Any recommendations?<p class=message>Absolutely. If you like seafood, try the fish and chips from Port Adelaide. And if you're a wine lover, check out the Barossa Valley for some of the best wine in Australia.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tips, officer. I'll definitely check those out.<p class=message>Glad to help. Anything else I can assist you with?<p class="message sent">No, that's all for now. Thanks again for the warning and the great advice.<p class=message>Happy to help. Have a safe trip back to Sydney.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a396c6ab-84d7-40eb-b170-0a52a8b2dade.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
