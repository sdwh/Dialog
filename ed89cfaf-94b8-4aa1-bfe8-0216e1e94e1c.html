Welcome to our little shop. What can I help you with today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I was just passing by and I noticed your shop. I wanted to take a look at what you have.<p class=message>Of course! We sell a variety of local specialties from Hokkaido. Is there anything specific you're interested in?<p class="message sent">Actually, I've never been to Hokkaido before, so I don't know what the specialties are. Could you recommend something?<p class=message>Absolutely! I highly recommend trying our freshly made mochi, made with locally grown rice. It's a popular snack among both tourists and locals.<p class="message sent">That sounds great! Can I also get some of your famous honey from Hokkaido? I've heard it's amazing.<p class=message>Yes, we have a great selection of honey here. Our favorite is the lavender honey, which is known for its unique flavor and aroma.<p class="message sent">I'll take a bottle of that too! It'll go well with my tea. Oh, and what's that cute little stuffed animal over there?<p class=message>That's a mascot plushie for a local brewery in town. It's become quite popular among tourists as a souvenir to take back home.<p class="message sent">Ha! I'll take one of those too. Thanks for your help! This place is awesome.<p class=message>Glad to hear it! We take pride in providing our customers with the best local products Hokkaido has to offer. Please come back and visit us again soon.<p class="message sent">Will do! Have a great day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed87c248-e066-446a-adb7-4afa66b33a92.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
