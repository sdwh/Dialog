Can you tell me more about the history of this place?<p class="message sent">Of course, A. Kiyomizu-dera Temple was founded in 778, over 1200 years ago, and is one of the most famous temples in Kyoto.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. I'm looking forward to learning more about it. What's the meaning behind the name "Kiyomizu-dera"?<p class="message sent">"Kiyomizu" means clear water, which refers to the Otowa waterfall where visitors can drink water believed to have healing properties.<p class=message>Oh, I see. That's fascinating. What else can we expect to see inside the temple?<p class="message sent">You'll see the main hall where visitors can offer prayers and see a beautiful view of Kyoto, as well as Jishu Shrine, dedicated to the god of love.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. I heard there's also a popular tradition of jumping off the stage of the main hall. Have you done it before?<p class="message sent">No, but many visitors do it to make a wish. It's said that if you survive the 13-meter jump, your wish will come true!<p class=message>(laughs) That's quite a leap of faith. I think I'll stick to just making a wish like most visitors do. What's your favorite thing about this temple?<p class="message sent">I love the autumn foliage here. The trees turn a beautiful shade of red and orange, and it's truly breathtaking.<p class=message>I can imagine. Kiyomizu-dera definitely seems like a must-visit spot in Kyoto. Thank you for your insights, B. I can't wait to write about this in my travel article.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. I hope you enjoy the rest of your visit to Kyoto.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eb760a1a-27f5-4663-8cb7-24dd74420323.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
