I heard you're looking for some help with selecting teaching materials?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! I've been struggling to find engaging and relevant materials for my classes.<p class=message>Well don't worry, we've got a great selection for you to choose from. What level are your students?<p class="message sent">They're intermediate level, around TOEIC 600-700.<p class=message>Okay, great. Have you considered using authentic materials like magazines or news articles? They're a fantastic way to expose students to real English language usage.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's an interesting idea. But won't they be too challenging for my students?<p class=message>Not necessarily. You could always choose articles that are tailored for non-native speakers, and provide support materials like vocabulary lists and comprehension questions.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. I'll definitely look into it. What about textbooks? Any recommendations?<p class=message>Of course! We have a great selection of textbooks for intermediate levels, with topics ranging from business to travel and culture.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. Which one do you recommend?<p class=message>How about this one - "English for Business Professionals". It covers a range of business-related topics and has engaging activities and exercises.<p class="message sent">Sounds great, I'll give it a go. Thanks for your help!<p class=message>No problem at all. And if you need anything else, don't hesitate to ask.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=746b48f2-d6a3-4efb-9789-096b699ed731.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
