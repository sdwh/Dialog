Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I've been reading up on it and I think it could really benefit our company's security measures.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting! What have you found out so far?<p class=message>Well, apparently it provides a framework for managing and protecting sensitive information, as well as identifying and mitigating risks.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So it's like a comprehensive security solution?<p class=message>Exactly! And it's been adopted by organizations all around the world, so it's definitely a reputable standard.<p class="message sent">Hmm, but does it involve a lot of testing? I'm not really a fan of that part.<p class=message>Well, there is some testing involved, but it's all necessary to ensure our security is up to standard. Plus, we can always hire a third party to do the testing for us.<p class="message sent">Okay, that makes sense. So where do we start?<p class=message>The first step is to get familiar with the ISO 27001 standard, and then we can conduct a gap analysis to see where we need to improve.<p class="message sent">Got it. And how long do you think this whole process will take?<p class=message>It can vary depending on the size and complexity of our organization, but usually it takes a few months to a year to fully implement.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's quite a commitment. But I agree that our security is important, so let's do it!<p class=message>Great, I'll start putting together a plan and we can meet up again soon to go over it in more detail.<p class="message sent">Perfect, looking forward to it!<p class=message>One last thing - do you want to be responsible for any particular aspect of the implementation? Maybe testing?<p class="message sent">(laughs) How about I take charge of training our employees on the new security measures?<p class=message>Sounds good to me! Let's get started.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b2100d35-0654-4ee8-ba42-071cb3f7d97c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
