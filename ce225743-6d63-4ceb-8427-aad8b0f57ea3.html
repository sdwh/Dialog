How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thanks. I'm excited to get cooking some South African dishes today.<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic. Can you tell me a little bit more about the dishes we'll be making?<p class=message>Sure. We'll be preparing some bobotie, which is a savory dish with minced meat and spices, and also some biltong, which is a type of dried meat popular in South Africa.<p class="message sent">Wow, those sound delicious. I can't wait to try making them with you.<p class=message>Absolutely. The bobotie takes a little while to cook, so we'll start with that first.<p class="message sent">No problem. I'll start by setting the table and getting everything ready for when the bobotie is finished.<p class=message>That's a great idea. In the meantime, do you want to help me prepare the meat and spices?<p class="message sent">Of course. Let's get started.<p class="message sent">Wow, the bobotie smells amazing! I'm sure the customers will love it.<p class=message>Yes, it's one of our most popular dishes. And the biltong is a great appetizer too.<p class="message sent">I'm glad we were able to work together to make these dishes. It was lots of fun.<p class=message>Absolutely. Cooking is always more enjoyable when you have someone to share it with.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Thanks for a great morning in the kitchen.<p class=message>Anytime. Now let's go serve up some delicious South African cuisine!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ce202212-dd82-4aaf-80ab-35176b5f6f9a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
