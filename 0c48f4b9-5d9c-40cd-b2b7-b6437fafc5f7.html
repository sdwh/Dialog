It’s a really interesting topic.<p class="message sent message-content">No, I haven’t. What’s it about?<p class="message received message-content">Basically, it’s the practice of using psychologically manipulative techniques to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, that sounds like something out of a spy movie. Is it really that effective?<p class="message received message-content">Unfortunately, it is. Social engineering has become a popular tactic for hackers because it’s much easier to manipulate people than to bypass security systems.<p class="message sent message-content">That’s scary. So, what can we do to protect ourselves against it?<p class="message received message-content">The key is education and awareness. Employees need to be trained to recognize common social engineering techniques, such as phishing emails and phone scams.<p class="message sent message-content">Makes sense. Do you know of any real-life examples of social engineering attacks?<p class="message received message-content">One infamous example is the “Nigerian prince” email scam. Hackers sent out emails claiming to be Nigerian royalty looking to give away millions, but in reality, it was just a ploy to steal people’s personal information.<p class="message sent message-content">Ha! I actually received one of those emails once, but I didn’t fall for it.<p class="message received message-content">Good for you! It’s easy to fall prey to these attacks, but with the right education and awareness, we can protect ourselves and our organizations from data breaches.<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely. It’s fascinating how much psychology plays a role in something as technical as cyber security.<p class="message received message-content">Definitely! It’s a reminder that even the most advanced security measures can be easily defeated by human error.<p class="message sent message-content">Well, I’m going to make sure to educate myself and my team about ISO 27001 Social Engineering. Thanks for the heads up, A.<p class="message received message-content">No problem, always happy to chat about cyber security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0c450904-d1c0-45d4-a025-85654ff62429.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
