Have you been wanting to see it for a while?<p class="message sent">Definitely, A. I've heard great reviews about it. Do you have any snacks?<p class=message>Oh shoot, I forgot to buy some before we got here. I'll sneak out during the previews and grab us some.<p class="message sent">No worries, I brought some candy just in case. Junior Mints or Sour Patch Kids?<p class=message>Definitely Sour Patch Kids. Those are my absolute favorite! Thanks, B.<p class="message sent">Of course, no problem. So, have you been working on any new acting projects lately?<p class=message>Yeah, actually. I just finished up a play and I'm starting to audition for some film roles. It's been really exciting.<p class="message sent">That's awesome, A. I'm sure you'll land something soon. You're a great actor.<p class=message>Thanks, B. That means a lot coming from you. Speaking of films, what's your favorite movie genre?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I love romantic comedies. I know, I know. It's cheesy, but I can't help it!<p class=message>Hey, no judgments here. Rom-coms can be great. Have you seen the new one that just came out?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. How is it?<p class=message>It's really funny and charming. You should definitely check it out.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Maybe we can watch it together next time.<p class=message>For sure. Thanks for coming to see this movie with me today, B. It's been really fun.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. We should do it again sometime soon. Oh, and by the way, did you hear about that new acting workshop that just started up downtown? It might be perfect for you.<p class=message>No, I hadn't heard about it. Thanks for the heads up, B. I'll have to look into it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=df83b906-028d-4dbf-bcca-0249c8ce7e02.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
