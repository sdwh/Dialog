Before we get started, can you tell me a bit about how you've been managing your diabetes recently?<p class="message sent">Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. I've been trying to eat better and exercise more, but I still have trouble keeping my blood sugar levels consistent.<p class=message>I see. Well, medication is just one part of managing diabetes, so it's great that you're already taking steps to improve your diet and physical activity. Let's take a look at your prescription.<p class="message sent">Great. I'm hoping to switch to something that's more convenient to take, if possible.<p class=message>Absolutely. There are several options available. Have you considered an injectable medication? It only needs to be taken once a week.<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm not sure I'm ready for injections.<p class=message>No problem, we also have tablet medications that are easy to take and effective in managing blood sugar levels.<p class="message sent">That sounds much more manageable. And are there any side effects I should be aware of?<p class=message>Like all medications, there are potential side effects, but we'll go over the details together and make sure you have all the information you need.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I really appreciate it.<p class=message>Of course, and if you ever have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you manage your diabetes and stay healthy.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d4f5635c-4717-4cce-a015-3be08c278c8d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
