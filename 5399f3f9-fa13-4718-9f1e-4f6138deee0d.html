How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. I'm excited to work with you today, serving our customers the best of both worlds - French pastries and Japanese green tea.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a pleasure to work with you too. I've always admired your pastry-making expertise.<p class=message>Thank you, that means a lot coming from a tea connoisseur like you. Speaking of which, have you tried the new matcha flavor I've incorporated into my éclairs?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's amazing! The earthy flavor of the matcha perfectly complements the creamy texture of the éclair filling.<p class=message>I'm glad you like it. And have you tried my new lavender macaron?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've been wanting to. I hear it's already becoming quite popular among our customers.<p class=message>Yes, it is. It's always fulfilling to see people enjoy our creations.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of which, have you tried the new sencha blend I brought in from Japan?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm very curious to try it. What makes this particular blend special?<p class="message sent">It's made from high-quality sencha leaves harvested in early spring. The first flush is always the purest and most flavorful.<p class=message>That sounds wonderful. I'll make sure to try it during our break.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll make us some tea and we can enjoy it with a couple of macarons.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. It's always nice to have a little break and indulge in our own creations.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's the best perk of working in a pastry shop and tea lounge.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. We're lucky to do what we love and share it with others.<p class="message sent">Exactly. Let's get to work and make some delicious pastries and tea for our customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=539911f1-0217-4d48-a476-d0e921bbcaad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
