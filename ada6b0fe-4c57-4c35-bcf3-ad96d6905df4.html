We're about to take off for our next mission. Buckle up and let's get ready to soar!<p class="message sent">Roger that, captain! We've got everything under control here in the cabin. Just let us know if you need anything.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. So, how do you guys manage to stay alert during long-haul flights?<p class="message sent">Well, we make sure to walk around and stretch our legs as much as possible. And of course, caffeine is our best friend.<p class=message>Haha, I can definitely relate to that. Coffee is the only thing that keeps me going on these late-night missions.<p class="message sent">Speaking of late-night missions, have you ever seen any strange things in the sky while flying at night?<p class=message>Actually, yes. One time, I saw what looked like a UFO. But it turned out to be just a military drone.<p class="message sent">Wow, that must have been quite a sight. I've never seen anything like that in my years of flying.<p class=message>Well, just keep your eyes peeled. You never know what you might spot up here in the friendly skies.<p class="message sent">Hey, captain, do you have any advice for someone who wants to become a pilot like you?<p class=message>My best advice would be to never give up on your dreams, no matter how difficult they may seem. Also, get as much experience as you can by volunteering at airports and getting your private pilot's license.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice, captain. We'll make sure to pass it on to any aspiring pilots we know.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. Alright, everyone, we're approaching our destination. Please prepare for landing and thank you for flying with us today.<p class="message sent">Thank you, captain! It was a smooth ride as always. We'll see you on the next mission.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ada5fbd6-c8f0-492e-b181-2ca652de7afc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
