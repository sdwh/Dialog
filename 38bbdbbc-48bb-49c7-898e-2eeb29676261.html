We want to make sure that there is something for everyone.<p class=message>Will there be any secret unlockable cars?<p class="message sent">I can't give too much away, but I will say that we do have some fun Easter eggs hidden throughout the game.<p class=message>Ooh, that sounds exciting. What kind of tracks will be in the game?<p class="message sent">We're aiming to have a diverse set of tracks, from city streets to desert highways. We want to make sure that each track is unique and challenging.<p class=message>Sounds like you guys are really putting a lot of thought into this game.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We want it to be the best racing game out there.<p class=message>Well, I'm already excited to play it.
