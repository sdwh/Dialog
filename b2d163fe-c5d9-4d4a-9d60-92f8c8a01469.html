I always love serving up a great steak to our guests.<p class=message>You're a pro at it. Do you have any special tricks to make them extra juicy?<p class="message sent">Well, I always let the steak rest for a few minutes before serving. It helps the juices to redistribute and makes the steak juicier.<p class=message>That's a great tip, I'll have to remember that. Thanks!<p class="message sent">No problem, anything else you need help with?<p class=message>Yeah, can you whip up some garlic butter for the steaks?<p class="message sent">You got it! It's always a tasty addition to a perfectly cooked steak.<p class=message>I agree, it's the perfect finishing touch. I'll make sure to give you a taste of the marinade too.<p class="message sent">I can't wait. I love trying out new flavors.<p class=message>Me too, that's why I love being a grill master. There's always something delicious to experiment with.<p class="message sent">You're right, and it looks like our guests are enjoying it too. I see a lot of satisfied faces out there.<p class=message>It's always good to see them happy. I take pride in my work.<p class="message sent">And you should, you're doing an amazing job. Let me know if you need anything else.<p class=message>Will do, thanks for your help. You make my job a lot easier.<p class="message sent">Anytime, that's what I'm here for.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b2d015ba-e510-47d6-84b6-73fee3a64e00.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
