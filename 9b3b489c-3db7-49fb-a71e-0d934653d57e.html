Let's get started with some warm-up exercises.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Mind if I grab a quick sip of water first?<p class=message>Not at all. Hydration is important, especially when we're about to get moving.<p class="message sent">*chuckles* You sound like our gym teacher from high school.<p class=message>*laughs* I've been called worse. Alright, let's start with some scales.<p class="message sent">I always feel like a vocal warm-up when we do scales, even though I'm not a singer.<p class=message>It's good for all musicians to do some kind of warm-up before playing. It helps us get into the right mindset.<p class="message sent">That's true. Alright, let's do this.<p class=message>Great. Remember to go slow at first and then gradually increase the speed.<p class="message sent">Got it. *begins playing their instrument*<p class=message>*joins in with their own instrument* This feels good. We're definitely getting somewhere.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's always amazing how much better we sound after even just a few minutes of warming up.<p class=message>Now, let's work on that new piece we've been practicing.<p class="message sent">Ah yes, the one with the tricky intro.<p class=message>Don't worry, we've got this. Let's start from the beginning.<p class="message sent">*nervously chuckles* Okay, here we go.<p class=message>*guides the band through the intro* See? Not so bad, right?<p class="message sent">*relieved* Oh yeah, definitely not as bad as I thought it would be.<p class=message>*smiling* That's what I like to hear. Let's keep working on it and making progress. We've got a gig coming up and we want to sound our best.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Can't wait to rock the stage with you guys.<p class=message>*raises their hand for a high five* Let's do this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9b3a14eb-9125-43ed-8ec0-7f074ac2b1b4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
