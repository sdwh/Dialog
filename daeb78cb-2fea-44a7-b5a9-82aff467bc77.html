How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm in a bit of a pickle. I have a liability lawsuit against my business.<p class=message>That sounds serious. Can you tell me a bit more about the situation?<p class="message sent">Sure. One of my customers slipped on a wet floor and broke their leg. They are now suing me for medical expenses and lost wages.<p class=message>Okay, well, the first thing we need to do is gather all the information we can. Do you have any records regarding the incident?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have a video that shows the incident. But I don't know if it's admissible in court.<p class=message>Interesting. We'll definitely want to take a look at that. In the meantime, let's start talking strategy. Have you considered settling out of court?<p class="message sent">I have, but I'm not sure I want to admit fault. Plus, I think my insurance may cover some of the costs.<p class=message>I see. Well, we'll need to review your insurance policy to see what your coverage is. And as for admitting fault, we can always negotiate terms of the settlement to avoid that.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good plan. What's your success rate in these types of cases?<p class=message>I've had quite a bit of experience with liability cases, and my track record is pretty good. But every case is different, so I can't make any promises.<p class="message sent">Okay, well, I trust you'll do your best. Thanks for your help.<p class=message>No problem. We'll get through this together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dae7ab21-5642-481d-bfd6-5ef44b14df49.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
