How long have you been driving a taxi in this city?<p class="message sent">Oh, hello! It's been almost 10 years now. What about you? Is this your first visit to Mumbai?<p class=message>Yes, it is! I always wanted to come here and explore the city. I've heard so much about the food, the beaches, and the bustling markets.<p class="message sent">Oh yes, Mumbai is full of life and is definitely a treat for travelers. What are your plans for the day?<p class=message>I thought I would start with some street food, maybe vada pav or pav bhaji. And then explore the Gateway of India and take a boat ride to Elephanta Caves.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great plan! You should also visit the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, the heritage building that was featured in the movie 'Slumdog Millionaire'.<p class=message>Yes, I've heard so much about that too. Hey, do you always drive a taxi, or do you have any other hobbies?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a good question! Well, when I'm not driving, I love to play cricket with my friends. It's a national obsession!<p class=message>Cricket? Wow, I've never played that before. Maybe you could teach me sometime.<p class="message sent">Sure! And who knows, maybe you'll become a cricket star! Speaking of stars, Mumbai is home to the famous Bollywood film industry. Have you seen any Bollywood movies?<p class=message>Yes, I have! I absolutely loved 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' and 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham'. They were both so romantic!<p class="message sent">I agree, those are great movies. And if you're lucky, you might even spot a Bollywood celebrity on the streets of Mumbai.<p class=message>Really? That would be so exciting! Who knows, maybe I'll even become a celebrity myself.<p class="message sent">Anything is possible in Mumbai! Oh, we've arrived at your destination. Have a great day exploring the city, and don't forget to try the street food!<p class=message>Thanks so much! You've been a great driver and a great tour guide. Take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=18c959b9-e276-4dbf-abbe-73e7493ec18c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
