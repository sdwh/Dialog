It was amazing!<p class=message>That's awesome! I was thinking of going there soon. Do you have any recommendations for shopping or commercial centers?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out Cairns Central. It's a huge shopping mall with a ton of stores to choose from.<p class=message>Sounds great! What kind of stores do they have?<p class="message sent">They have everything from fashion to electronics. Plus, there's a food court there too, so you can grab a bite to eat while you shop.<p class=message>Perfect! What about some local markets?<p class="message sent">Well, Rusty's Market is a must-visit. It's open every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and you can find fresh produce and handmade crafts there.<p class=message>Oh, nice! That's always a good way to experience the local culture.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Plus, there are some great cafes and restaurants around the markets too.<p class=message>Yum, I love trying out local cuisine. Are there any other shopping areas you would recommend?<p class="message sent">Yeah, you should check out the Pier Shopping Centre. It's a smaller center, but it's right on the waterfront, so you get a great view while you shop.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. I can already picture myself there.<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah, it's a pretty picturesque spot.<p class=message>Do you have any advice for transportation around Cairns?<p class="message sent">Honestly, we just walked everywhere. But there are buses and taxis available too, if you need them.<p class=message>Gotcha. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for all the info!<p class="message sent">No problem. Have an amazing time in Cairns, it's definitely one of my favorite places I've visited.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=18649bde-2442-41e0-998f-9b5124df465f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
