Why is it important?<p class=message>Well, mobile devices are becoming more prevalent in the workplace, so it's important to ensure they're secure and not a risk to company data.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. So what kind of things does it cover?<p class=message>It covers things like access control, device management, encryption, and more.<p class="message sent">We should definitely look into implementing it then. Does it require a lot of work?<p class=message>It depends on the size of our company and how many devices we have, but it's definitely doable.<p class="message sent">What kind of devices does it cover?<p class=message>It covers everything from smartphones to laptops and tablets.<p class="message sent">I'm gonna have to start using my personal phone less for work then!<p class=message>Yeah, it's important to keep personal and work usage separate.<p class="message sent">How do we ensure employees follow the guidelines?<p class=message>We would need to provide training and have policies in place, as well as regularly checking compliance.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of work, but definitely worth it to protect our company's data.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's better to be safe than sorry.<p class="message sent">Do you know of any companies that have successfully implemented it?<p class=message>Yeah, I've heard that Microsoft and IBM have both implemented ISO 27001 MDM.<p class="message sent">If they can do it, I'm sure we can too.<p class=message>Definitely. Let's discuss it further with our team and see what steps we can take to implement it.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a1f629a-e70a-469c-b7a4-2c2768b8ede8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
