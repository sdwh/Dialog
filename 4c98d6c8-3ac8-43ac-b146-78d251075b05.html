How's business going today, B?<p class="message sent">Pretty good so far, A. What can I do for you?<p class=message>I've got some fresh seafood to sell today. Do you have any recommendations on the best way to display them?<p class="message sent">Definitely put them on ice and make sure they're organized by type. That way, customers can find what they're looking for easily.<p class=message>Great idea! By the way, have you tried any of our new sea scallops? They've been really popular this week.<p class="message sent">I haven't yet, but I'll have to try them soon. Speaking of seafood, do you have any tips for preparing monkfish? It's not a fish I'm very familiar with.<p class=message>Monkfish is delicious! It's often compared to lobster meat. I recommend pan-searing it with some garlic and lemon juice.<p class="message sent">I'll have to try that next time. Thanks for the suggestion. So, have you heard any interesting news lately?<p class=message>Actually, yes! Did you hear about the octopus that escaped from the aquarium and ended up on a nearby golf course?<p class="message sent">No way! That's hilarious. I wonder how it managed to get there.<p class=message>Apparently it snuck out of a small gap in the tank and found its way out to the ocean. From there, it crawled across the golf course.<p class="message sent">I can just picture it now, using its eight arms to carry golf clubs. Too funny!<p class=message>Haha! Well, it looks like we have a customer trying to flag us down. I better go attend to them.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Talk to you later, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4c971fc4-b3d1-4896-9ded-94481cf0750e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
