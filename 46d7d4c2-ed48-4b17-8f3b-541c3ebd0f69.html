What are they like?<p class=message>They have wider doorways, lower beds, and roll-in showers. It's great for people with mobility issues.<p class="message sent">That's amazing! Do they cost more than regular hotels?<p class=message>Unfortunately, yes. But it's worth it for the convenience and accessibility.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's important for everyone to have equal access to travel accommodations.<p class=message>Absolutely. And it's not just hotels, but also restaurants, attractions, and public transportation that need to be accessible.<p class="message sent">Yes, and it's not just for people with physical disabilities, but also for people with sensory and cognitive disabilities.<p class=message>Exactly! It's not just about being physically unable to do something, but about accommodating different needs.<p class="message sent">Accessibility is a journey, not a destination. We need to constantly strive to be more inclusive and thoughtful.<p class=message>Well said! It's also up to people to be aware and considerate of others' needs.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And we should advocate for accessibility wherever we go, so others can enjoy the same experiences as us.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's make accessibility a priority and create a more inclusive world for everyone.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=46d77505-9b4e-42ab-ba0d-9674e0e8133d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
