What's it about?<p class=message>It's a puzzling game where you have to escape from a room by solving riddles and finding hidden objects.<p class="message sent">That sounds quite exciting. What level are you on now?<p class=message>I'm on level 6. It's getting tougher with each level, but I love the challenge.<p class="message sent">Can you give me some clues for level 1? I'm still stuck there.<p class=message>Sure thing! Look for anything that seems out of place and try clicking on it. And don't forget to check every corner of the room.<p class="message sent">Got it. Thanks for the tip.<p class=message>No problem. Oh, by the way, have you tried playing with the sound on?<p class="message sent">No, does it make a difference?<p class=message>Definitely! It adds a whole new dimension to the game. The sound effects are amazing.<p class="message sent">That sounds cool. I'll turn it on next time.<p class=message>Great. Let me know how it goes. Maybe we can collaborate on the higher levels.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I love solving these kinds of mysteries.<p class=message>Me too! It's like being a detective in an interactive story.<p class="message sent">Exactly. It's much more engaging than just watching a movie or reading a book.<p class=message>Agreed. It's also a fun way to pass the time while improving our problem-solving skills.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And it's also a great stress reliever. I could play this game for hours!<p class=message>Haha! Me too. It looks like we've found a new addiction.<p class="message sent">That's for sure! Okay, I'm going to get back to level 1 now. Thanks for the tips, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. Good luck and have fun!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c0f9ebe3-9a82-4fe0-a6a6-298d0d6c31c5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
