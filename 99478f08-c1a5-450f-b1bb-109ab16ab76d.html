I heard you're a game developer. What kind of games do you make?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! I mostly work on PC games. Currently, I'm designing a new strategy game.<p class=message>That sounds interesting! What's the game about?<p class="message sent">It's a game where you build and manage your own theme park. You have to attract visitors, build attractions, and manage finances.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work. Are you including any roller coasters in the game?<p class="message sent">Of course! Roller coasters are some of the most exciting attractions in theme parks. We're also adding other rides like Ferris wheels and water slides.<p class=message>Cool! Are there any challenges in the game?<p class="message sent">Yes, there are a lot of challenges. You have to make sure your visitors are happy, keep your finances balanced, and deal with unexpected events like weather changes.<p class=message>I can't wait to try it out! When do you think it will be released?<p class="message sent">We're aiming for a release in about six months. We want to make sure everything is perfect before it's released.<p class=message>Wow, that's a long time. Can I test out the game before its release?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, we're not allowing any external testing. We want the full version to be a surprise.<p class=message>That's understandable. Well, good luck with the development process!<p class="message sent">Thank you! It's a lot of hard work, but we're making progress every day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9947473d-a0d5-4af2-876f-8b03aed72fbf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
