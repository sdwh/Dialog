How has your medication been working out for you?<p class="message sent">I think it's been working well. Except that, it's difficult to keep up with the dosage.<p class=message>Yes, it can be hard to remember at times. Maybe you could use pillboxes to make things easier.<p class="message sent">Pillboxes? What's that?<p class=message>It's a small container where you can store your medication in separate compartments for different days and times.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds like a great idea. I'll try that out.<p class=message>Yes, it should help you stay on track. By the way, anything else that's bothering you?<p class="message sent">Not really, but I've been feeling stressed out at work lately.<p class=message>Stress can cause a lot of health problems. Maybe you could try some relaxation techniques like yoga or meditation.<p class="message sent">Yoga? I'm not sure if I'm flexible enough for that.<p class=message>Don't worry, there are different types of yoga that cater to different levels of flexibility. It's worth giving it a try.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll look into it. Thanks for the suggestion, doc.<p class=message>No problem, B. And don't forget to take your medication on time.<p class="message sent">I won't forget. Thanks again, doc.<p class=message>Take care and see you next time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=92917a01-44ae-4742-b586-862cb4dc3c41.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
