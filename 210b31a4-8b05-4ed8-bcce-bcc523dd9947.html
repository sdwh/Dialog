How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great. I'm excited to taste some of your famous kimchi!<p class="message sent">I'm excited to share it with you. Our kimchi is made with local ingredients and traditional family recipes.<p class=message>That's wonderful! Speaking of ingredients, may I ask about the quality of the cabbage you use?<p class="message sent">Of course. We only use the freshest and crispiest cabbage for our kimchi.<p class=message>That's good to hear. As a food quality control officer, I take the freshness of the ingredients seriously.<p class="message sent">I understand completely. We want to provide our customers with the best possible product.<p class=message>Absolutely. Speaking of which, let's move on to the quality check. I brought some equipment to test the pH level, texture and color of the kimchi.<p class="message sent">Sounds great, I'm happy to work with you on that.<p class=message>Ok, let's start with the pH level. It should be around 4.2 to 4.5 for the best taste.<p class="message sent">Yes, you're right. Our pH level is usually around 4.3 to 4.4.<p class=message>Great, it passed the test! Now onto texture - it should be firm and crunchy.<p class="message sent">Our kimchi is always crunchy because we use freshly harvested cabbage.<p class=message>That's perfect. Lastly, the color should be bright red or orange.<p class="message sent">Yes, we use natural food coloring to achieve that vibrant color.<p class=message>Excellent, everything looks good. Now, let's enjoy some kimchi together!<p class="message sent">Yes, let's dig in. I also made some Korean-style fried chicken to go with it.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds amazing. You're not just a kimchi master, you're a talented cook as well!<p class="message sent">Thank you, I love experimenting with new recipes.<p class=message>Well, let's eat and enjoy some good food together. So grateful for this chance to collaborate with you.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. Always a pleasure to work with someone who cares about food quality and respects our craft. Bon appetit!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=21076584-1230-421c-bd22-9efbe0f144fe.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
