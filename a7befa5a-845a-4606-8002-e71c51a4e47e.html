How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm good, thank you for asking. How can I help you?<p class=message>I'm a barista and I'm here to grind some coffee beans and prepare some fresh pastries. Could you show me where the espresso machine is?<p class="message sent">Sure, the espresso machine is right over there. Do you want me to help you with anything?<p class=message>That would be great, thank you! Can you tell me which pastries are the most popular here?<p class="message sent">Well, our blueberry muffins are always a hit, but our chocolate croissants are also pretty popular.<p class=message>Hmm, those both sound delicious. I'll make sure to try them myself.<p class="message sent">You definitely should! So, have you been to San Francisco before?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's one of my favorite cities.<p class="message sent">That's awesome! What's your favorite thing to do while you're here?<p class=message>Oh, I love to visit the Golden Gate Park and the Fisherman's Wharf. And of course, grab a cup of coffee at one of the local coffee shops!<p class="message sent">Yes, San Francisco has some amazing coffee shops. I'm glad you enjoy it here.<p class=message>Me too. So, what do you recommend in terms of coffee drinks?<p class="message sent">Well, if you're a fan of espresso, our cappuccino is really good. But if you're in the mood for something sweeter, our vanilla latte is also a must-try.<p class=message>Hmm, I think I'll have to try both! Thank you for your recommendations.<p class="message sent">Of course, anytime! Do you need any help with the coffee beans?<p class=message>No, I think I've got it. Thank you for all of your help!<p class="message sent">No problem, let me know if you need anything else.<p class=message>Will do. Thanks again!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a7b92915-5147-4aa5-8926-3932d2c5f1be.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
