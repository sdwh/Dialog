I'm Officer A, and I'm here to ask you a few questions.<p class="message sent">Good morning, officer. Of course, ask me whatever you need to know.<p class=message>So, Mr. B, we received a report about a car theft last night, and eyewitnesses saw you at the scene. Did you see anything or know anything about this?<p class="message sent">A car theft? No, I had no idea. I was sleeping soundly at my home last night.<p class=message>Hmm, that's interesting. And what kind of car do you drive, Mr. B?<p class="message sent">Oh, a red sports car. It's my pride and joy.<p class=message>And where was your red sports car located last night?<p class="message sent">It was parked in my garage, safe and sound. Are you suggesting that I stole a car last night, officer?<p class=message>I'm not suggesting anything yet, Mr. B. I'm simply trying to get as much information as possible. So, did you happen to see anyone suspicious hanging around the area last night?<p class="message sent">No, I didn't see anyone. But I did hear my neighbor's dog barking incessantly around midnight.<p class=message>Interesting. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. B. We'll keep you updated if we have any further questions.<p class="message sent">Of course, officer. I'm happy to help in any way I can. But honestly, stealing a car? That's not really my style.<p class=message>I understand, Mr. B. We're just following standard procedures. Now, do you have any questions for me?<p class="message sent">No, not really. Just hoping that you can catch whoever is responsible for the theft.<p class=message>Don't worry, Mr. B. We'll do our best. Have a good day.<p class="message sent">You too, officer. And good luck with the investigation.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ebbc2ba7-bd0d-473c-ada8-2dac11b96a5f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
