How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey! It's going great, thanks for asking. What brings you by?<p class=message>I was hoping to pick your brain a little bit about natural language processing. We're trying to figure out how we can use it to analyze user sentiment.<p class="message sent">Well, that's certainly an interesting problem. Have you thought about which platforms you'll be analyzing sentiment on? Twitter is quite popular with sentiment analysis.<p class=message>Yes, we're definitely interested in Twitter. But we're also looking at some other social media platforms where users leave a lot of text-based feedback, like Yelp and Facebook.<p class="message sent">Great, those all sound like great sources to analyze sentiment. Have you considered using any specific natural language processing tools?<p class=message>Yes, we've been looking into using sentiment analysis APIs like Watson or Google Cloud Natural Language. But we're also exploring the possibility of building our own model.<p class="message sent">Building your own model sounds like a big project, but it could be worth it in the end. I'd be interested in collaborating with you on building it out if you need any help.<p class=message>That sounds great, I'd definitely appreciate your expertise there. But just out of curiosity, what do you think the challenges of building our own model would be?<p class="message sent">Well, there's definitely a lot of data pre-processing that would come into play. And even after you have your model defined, you'd still need to train it with a lot of data to ensure that it's robust enough.<p class=message>Yeah, that makes sense. It sounds like we might be better off starting with an API and then building out our model over time. Thanks for helping me think through all of this!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2ab9ff85-de84-42bd-903c-9e78c5faaa08.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
