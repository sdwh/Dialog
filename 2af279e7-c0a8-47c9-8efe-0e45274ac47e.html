It's been a mixed bag, A. The weather's been dull, but the roads have been uncharacteristically smooth, and you can't beat that!<p class=message>That's wonderful to hear. I'm heading to London for a job interview. Have you ever had one of those?<p class="message sent">Good on you for getting the interview, mate. As for me, I haven't, but I've taken plenty of folks to one. Keep calm and rock that interview!<p class=message>Thank you, I'll try my best. Have you heard any good songs on the radio recently?<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm always blasting the radio. I heard "Dancing in the Dark" last night by Bruce Springsteen, which always puts a smile on my face.<p class=message>I love that song! Speaking of dancing, do you like dancing?<p class="message sent">I used to, back in the days when I was young and full of energy. Now, it's a bit harder on the old bones!<p class=message>Haha, I can understand that. Hey, have you ever seen a celebrity in person?<p class="message sent">In my line of work, I've seen a few. I once had Katie Price hop into my cab, and I must say, she was a charmer.<p class=message>Wow, that must have been exciting! I've never seen a celebrity in person before.<p class="message sent">You never know in London, A. The city's full of surprises!<p class=message>Indeed it is. So, how much longer until we get to my destination?<p class="message sent">Not much longer, we'll be hitting the city in a few minutes. Make sure you've got your seatbelt on tight!<p class=message>Thanks for the heads up, B. You've been a great taxi driver, and this ride was definitely worth it!<p class="message sent">Always happy to make a customer happy, A. Safe travels and all the best for your interview!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2af144de-8fb6-42a3-bd45-2c47cbc8afee.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
