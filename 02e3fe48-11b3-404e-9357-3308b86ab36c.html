How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thanks. Just busy with all the orders coming in. How about you?<p class=message>Oh, it's been pretty hectic too. But I always enjoy delivering food to different places.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I appreciate your hard work.

We get a lot of positive feedback on those noodles. They really pack a punch.<p class=message>Yeah, I definitely need a drink afterwards. But I can handle the heat.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You're braver than me. I can't handle anything too spicy. But our customers seem to love it.<p class=message>Absolutely. There's a big demand for spicy food these days. What are some of your bestsellers?<p class="message sent">Well, our fried chicken wings are always a hit. And our bubble tea is really popular too.<p class=message>Bubble tea is huge right now. Do you have any recommendations for flavors?<p class="message sent">Definitely try our matcha bubble tea.
