He has a bit of a cold and a cough.<p class=message>Of course, we have a few options for infants. Have you spoken to your pediatrician yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, she recommended something for his cough, but I'm not sure what to get for his cold.<p class=message>Well, we have some saline drops that are safe for infants to help with nasal congestion. And we also have some natural remedies like honey that can help soothe a sore throat.<p class="message sent">That sounds great, but how do I know how much to give him?<p class=message>Typically, the dosage will be based on your baby's weight. We can check our dosage chart together to make sure you're giving him the right amount.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your help. I want to make sure he gets the right medication and dosage.<p class=message>No problem. It's important to be cautious with medication for infants. They can't express how they're feeling, so we have to be extra careful.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm so glad I came here. You're so helpful.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. We're here to help parents like you navigate the challenges of caring for a baby.<p class="message sent">Well, it's definitely an adventure! Thanks again for your help, I feel more confident now.<p class=message>You're welcome. Take care and feel free to come back if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e88e139-5e6b-44da-b84c-601f182a2798.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
