How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I'm doing great, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm excited to be here, especially since we'll be making some of my favorite desserts - like the matcha mille crepe cake.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. I have a feeling our customers are going to love it.<p class=message>Absolutely! And what better way to complement the cakes than with some freshly brewed coffee? Do you have a favorite brewing method?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of pour-over coffee. It really brings out the flavors of the coffee beans.<p class=message>Ah, yes. You can taste the difference! Speaking of flavors, have you ever tried infusing your coffee with matcha?<p class="message sent">I've heard of it, but I haven't tried it myself. How would you recommend doing it?<p class=message>Well, you could start by making a concentrated matcha paste and then mixing it into the coffee grounds before brewing. Or, you could sprinkle matcha powder on top of the grounds right before brewing.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting, I'll definitely have to try it out sometime. So, what's the first step in making the matcha mille crepe cake?<p class=message>We'll need to start by making the crepes, about 20 in total. Then, we'll prepare the matcha custard and whipped cream filling.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a lot of work, but worth it for the end result.<p class=message>It absolutely is! And the best part is, we can experiment with different flavors and toppings to make each cake unique.<p class="message sent">I love how creative we can get with desserts and drinks. It's like art in a cup or on a plate.<p class=message>Yes, it really is! And it's always great to share our creations with others and see their reactions.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I can't wait to see the looks on our customers' faces when they try our matcha mille crepe cake and perfectly brewed coffee.<p class=message>Me too! It's going to be a great day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=15f2eb1f-7964-42d4-b76b-1d9cb0a6c385.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
