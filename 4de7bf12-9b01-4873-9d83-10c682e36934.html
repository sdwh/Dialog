Thanks for helping me out!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Just doing my job. So, what's the problem with your car?<p class=message>Well, it's been making this weird clunking noise when I take corners. I'm not sure what's wrong.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that could be a suspension issue. Let me take a look.<p class=message>Alright, go ahead. Just don't take too long. I've got a race this afternoon.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I work fast. By the way, did you hear about the new driver in the competition?<p class=message>No, what about him?<p class="message sent">Apparently, he's been dominating every race he's entered. He's got some serious skills.<p class=message>Well, I'm not worried. I've been racing for years. I can handle any competition.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit! By the way, have you ever considered adding some turbochargers to your car?<p class=message>Turbochargers? That sounds expensive.<p class="message sent">It might be, but trust me, it'll give you a serious edge on the track.<p class=message>Hmm, I'll think about it. But first, let's get this clunking noise fixed.<p class="message sent">Alright, I think I found the problem. One of your sway bar links is broken. I'll replace it in no time.<p class=message>Great, thanks. You're a lifesaver.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. Just remember to drive safe out there, even if you're feeling confident.<p class=message>Yeah, I know. Safety first. But at the same time, I'm looking forward to winning this race.<p class="message sent">I believe in you, A. Now go show everybody what you're made of.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4de74fb2-24db-472d-8e91-5a51a86a7c1d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
