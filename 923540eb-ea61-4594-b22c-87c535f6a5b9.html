It looks like we have a lot of orders to fulfill today.<p class="message sent">Yes, we do. But that's the fun part of our job, right?<p class=message>Absolutely! So, what's your favorite type of noodle to make?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I would say it's the classic Tomato Egg Noodles. What about you?<p class=message>I love making Dan Dan Noodles. The spicy and savory combination is just perfect.<p class="message sent">Nice choice! Now, onto the drinks. What do you think is the most popular flavor of milk tea we have?<p class=message>I would say it's definitely Brown Sugar Milk Tea.<p class="message sent">You're right. It's always flying off the shelf. But my personal favorite is Matcha Milk Tea.<p class=message>Oh, that's a good one too. But it's always interesting to see what other flavors the customers order.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Sometimes they come up with their own creative combinations.<p class=message>Yes, I remember one customer ordered a Bubble Milk Tea with extra lychee jelly.<p class="message sent">That sounds really sweet. I hope they enjoyed it.<p class=message>Me too. You know, working together like this really makes the workload easier.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Plus, we get to taste all the delicious food and drinks too!<p class=message>Yes, and we can always learn from each other's techniques and skills.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We make a great team, don't we?<p class=message>Definitely! Let's keep up the good work and make some mouth-watering dishes for our customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=923491f8-4b40-46f5-b1c3-72443ef5d9c7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
