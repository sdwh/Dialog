How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing fine, thank you for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, just a bit nervous about our trip to Wuhan. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have been there a few times. It's a nice city, and the people are very friendly.<p class=message>That's good to know. Do you have any recommendations for places to visit?<p class="message sent">You should definitely visit the Yellow Crane Tower, it's a beautiful landmark with a great view of the city. And if you like spicy food, Wuhan is famous for its hot pot.<p class=message>I love spicy food! I'll be sure to try the hot pot. Have you tried it before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's very spicy, but also very delicious. Just be careful not to eat too much!<p class=message>Haha, I'll try to pace myself. What else can you tell me about Wuhan?<p class="message sent">Well, Wuhan is also known for its lakes and rivers. You should take a boat ride on the Yangtze River, it's a great way to see the city from a different perspective.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. I'm really excited to explore Wuhan now.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that. Just sit back and relax, we'll be there in no time.<p class=message>Thanks, B. You're a great driver.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It's my pleasure to drive you to Wuhan. Just let me know if you need anything during the trip.<p class=message>Will do. Thanks again.<p class="message sent">No problem. Enjoy your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=455e7cf4-0556-40ab-a477-10197188d231.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
