What was it about?<p class=message>Apparently, there was a flaw in our authentication system that could allow unauthorized access to our database.<p class="message sent">That sounds serious. Have you already found a way to fix it?<p class=message>Yes, I've already created a patch that addresses the issue. But before we deploy it, we need to make sure that it doesn't break any other parts of the system.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We should do some regression testing to ensure that all functionalities are still working as intended.<p class=message>Right, and also conduct a code review to check for any other potential vulnerabilities.<p class="message sent">Speaking of code reviews, have you noticed that our team has been flagging a lot of code smells lately?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. It's a good thing that we're being proactive about code quality.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Do you have any tips on how we can prevent code smells from happening in the first place?<p class=message>One thing we can do is to follow best practices and design patterns when writing code. It also helps to have a second pair of eyes look at our code before it gets committed.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. Thanks for the advice.<p class=message>No problem! It's always better to catch these things sooner rather than later.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's all part of being a responsible and quality-focused developer.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=013683c7-89cf-46a7-aa08-54e61e1797c7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
