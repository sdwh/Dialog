How's the coffee business today?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Business is bustling. How about your freshly baked bread?<p class=message>The bread is out of the oven and smelling great! Perfect for pairing with your coffee.<p class="message sent">Great to hear! I'll have to grab a loaf for myself later. How many cups of coffee do you need today?<p class=message>I have a few orders already, but I could always use more. How many loaves of bread will you need?<p class="message sent">Probably around six loaves since it's a busy day. Can't wait to see the delicious bread you've baked.<p class=message>I'm always trying new recipes, so it'll be a surprise even for me! By the way, did you see the sunrise this morning?<p class="message sent">Yes, it was stunning. Makes mornings like this worth getting up early for.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's a beautiful day for a stroll along the boardwalk.<p class="message sent">Speaking of boardwalk, have you tried the new ice cream place that just opened up?<p class=message>Not yet, I've been too stuck on eating my own baked goods! How about you?<p class="message sent">I stopped by yesterday after my shift and it was amazing. You have to try their salted caramel flavor.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds delicious. Maybe we could have an ice cream and coffee pairing event next week?<p class="message sent">I'd love that! And we can also showcase some of your new bread recipes.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I'm looking forward to it already!<p class="message sent">Me too. Let's make it happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f38fb0ec-9d34-45a4-88d6-dfbad7120378.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
