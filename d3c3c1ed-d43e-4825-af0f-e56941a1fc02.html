How's your day going so far, B?<p class="message sent">It's going great, thank you! How about you?<p class=message>Pretty good! Just excited to visit Atlanta for the first time. What's your favourite thing about this city?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely the food! You'll have to try out some of the local barbeque spots.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! Do you like to cook yourself?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I love trying out new recipes in my free time. How about you, A? Do you cook often?<p class=message>I try to, but I'm not the best at it. Luckily, I have some great restaurants to fall back on.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! You can't go wrong with some good takeout. Have you tried any of the pizza places around here?<p class=message>Not yet, but I heard there are some great options. Do you have a personal favourite?<p class="message sent">Yes, there's a spot called Antico Pizza that's always packed with locals. You should definitely check it out.<p class=message>I'll make a note of that for sure! Speaking of notes, do you have any good music recommendations for the ride?<p class="message sent">Sure do! Let me put on some great classic rock to get us in the mood for the trip.<p class=message>Awesome, I love a good classic rock song! Do you have a favourite band?<p class="message sent">Oh man, it's so tough to choose just one. But if I had to, I'd say it's probably Led Zeppelin.<p class=message>I'm definitely a fan of theirs as well. What's your favourite song by them?<p class="message sent">Kashmir, hands down. It's such an epic piece of music. What about you, A?<p class=message>I love Stairway to Heaven! It's such a beautiful song that never gets old.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, that's a classic one for sure. We're almost to your destination, A. I hope you have a great time in Atlanta!<p class=message>Thanks so much, B! You've been a great driver and conversation partner. I'll keep your recommendations in mind. Have a good rest of your day.<p class="message sent">You too, A! Take care.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d3c0137c-b3c9-4a04-b2d5-e1d6f06815fa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
