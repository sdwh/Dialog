I hope you're enjoying our site visit.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I am. But I gotta tell you, Mr. Architect, I'm not so sure about that huge window you've got planned for the front.<p class=message>Really? I thought it'd be a great way to maximize natural light and give the building an open and modern feel.<p class="message sent">I get that, but don't you think it'll be a little too exposed? I don't want my workers to feel like they're on display.<p class=message>I see your point. You're worried about privacy. Well, we could always add some blinds or curtains for when they need to conduct confidential meetings.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. Hey, since we're discussing the exterior, what if we added some greenery to give it a more natural look?<p class=message>I love it! We could plant some trees or lay down some sod to make it feel like an outdoor oasis.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And speaking of oasis, have you thought about adding a rooftop garden or something?<p class=message>Actually, I have. I was thinking we could put in some grass and maybe even a little herb garden for their onsite cafeteria.<p class="message sent">Nice! I can already see the Instagram posts. "@Company's rooftop garden looking fine!"<p class=message>Haha, yeah, we'll definitely have to unplug those elevators if that happens!<p class="message sent">Hey, I may not be an architect, but I do know a few things. Like how important it is for the flow of the office to have a great break room.<p class=message>Of course. We've got some cool coffee machine ideas and a state-of-the-art fridge that has it's own Twitter account.<p class="message sent">A fridge with a Twitter account? Now that's something I've got to see!<p class=message>It's pretty impressive. So, what else do you think we need to address?<p class="message sent">I was thinking, since we're going for modern, what if we installed some smart lighting and temperature controls?<p class=message>Good idea. We could have it all set up with voice-activated commands or even through an app on their phones.<p class="message sent">Awesome. With all these features, I have a feeling my employees won't want to leave the office!<p class=message>That's what we're aiming for. I'll get started with some sketches and plans for all of these ideas. We'll have the coolest office in town!<p class="message sent">Can't wait to see it all come together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9ccbdac5-3cfd-49fb-b18a-d63aaa2d1582.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
