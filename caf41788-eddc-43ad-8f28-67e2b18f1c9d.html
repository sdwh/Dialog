It's quite a process, isn't it?<p class=message>Definitely. Do you remember the steps they took to audit the process?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I do. First, they started by reviewing our information security policy.<p class=message>Right, and after that?<p class="message sent">Then, they went through our risk assessments and management processes.<p class=message>Did they ask for any evidence or documentation to support our claims?<p class="message sent">Yes, they did. We had to provide them with evidence that our controls were working as intended.<p class=message>That sounds nerve-wracking.<p class="message sent">It can be, but if you know your stuff, it's not so bad.<p class=message>Great point. Did they also review our incident management and business continuity plans?<p class="message sent">They sure did. And we had to prove we had tested them in the past year.<p class=message>Yikes. That sounds stressful.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that part can be a bit of a headache.<p class=message>How about the physical security aspect?<p class="message sent">Oh, they definitely looked at that too. We had to show them that we had physical security measures in place to protect our assets.<p class=message>It definitely seems like a thorough process.<p class="message sent">It is very comprehensive but completing it successfully will boost your organization's reputation.<p class=message>I can see why. Thanks for sharing your experience with me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=caebf255-b0c8-4548-a4f7-0696a9da28b4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
