They had the best latte I've ever had.<p class=message>Oh nice, where was it?<p class="message sent">It was in Melbourne. They have a huge coffee culture there.<p class=message>I've heard that before. What makes their coffee culture so different?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, they take their coffee really seriously. They have this thing called a "flat white," which is kind of like a cappuccino but with less foam.<p class=message>Interesting. Do they have any unique coffee shops with cool vibes?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! There's this one place in Sydney that's actually hidden behind a barber shop. It's super trendy and has a really chill atmosphere.<p class=message>That sounds awesome. Do you have any more recommendations?<p class="message sent">Yeah, there's this other spot in Brisbane that has a really rustic feel to it. They use locally sourced beans and have a variety of brewing methods to choose from.<p class=message>Wow, those all sound great. I'll have to make a trip to Australia just to try them all!<p class="message sent">Definitely worth a try. Let me know if you need any more recommendations.<p class=message>For sure. Thanks a bunch!<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b3b6bb52-737d-42b3-921c-97f4ce7807cc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
