How's it going today, B?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It's going pretty well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. I'm excited to start another day here in Ekkamai. I have a feeling the sun is going to shine extra brightly today!<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Speaking of shining, have you tried my new lemon meringue tart? It's got a beautiful glossy finish and a refreshing tang.<p class=message>No, not yet! But it sounds like the perfect companion to a cup of your delicious dark roast. Have you tried the Kenyan AA we got in this week?<p class="message sent">I haven't, but I'd love to do a taste test with you. I'll bring over a couple of slices of tart and we can have a little coffee and dessert flight.<p class=message>That's a deal. It's like we're our own mini cafe crawl right here! (laughs)<p class="message sent">Yes, except no travel costs!<p class=message>Hey, have you seen the new mural on the corner building? It's bright and colourful, and they finished it just last night.<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! It's beautiful! That street artist has real talent.<p class=message>Yeah, I know, right? Maybe we should hire them to paint our little corner green.<p class="message sent">We'd definitely stand out! But let's make sure we don't clash with the mural, haha.<p class=message>(laughs) Agreed. Oh, before I forget--have you had a chance to test out that new aeropress I bought for us?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! And, might I say, it's a game-changer. The body on that coffee is amazing.<p class=message>I know! I can't believe we went so long without one. It's like my morning has been kicked into another gear.<p class="message sent">It's always the little things, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. And speaking of little things, did you see the new shop next door? It's all handmade jewelry and pottery.<p class="message sent">Ooh, I haven't! Let's go check it out on our break.<p class=message>Yes, and we can bring our new friend the aeropress with us, haha.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I think our little corner on Ekkamai is quickly becoming the perfect spot to spend a morning.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=396afec5-ad43-42c6-9796-965b23b4729f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
