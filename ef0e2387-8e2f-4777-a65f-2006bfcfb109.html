Are you finding everything alright?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. Thank you for asking.<p class=message>Great to hear that. I'm A, your friendly mall security for tonight. May I know your name, ma'am?<p class="message sent">My name is Lisa.<p class=message>Hi, Lisa. Do you visit this mall often?<p class="message sent">Not really. It's my first time here.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Well, if you need any assistance, don't hesitate to approach any of us here. We are here to help.<p class="message sent">That's very comforting to know. Thank you.<p class=message>No problem at all. Just doing our job. By the way, have you seen any movies recently?<p class="message sent">Now that you mention it, I caught the latest comedy at the cinemas a week ago. It was hilarious!<p class=message>Oh, I'm a fan of comedies too! What was the title, if you don't mind me asking?<p class="message sent">It's called "Game Night". Have you watched it?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I thought the plot was quite fresh and the characters were amusing too.<p class="message sent">I agree. The actors were fantastic, especially the one who played Gary.<p class=message>Oh yes, Jesse Plemons. He's really good at playing awkward and bizarre characters.<p class="message sent">Exactly! You seem to know a lot about movies.<p class=message>Well, it's my hobby, so I guess it comes naturally. There's nothing like popcorn, soda and a good flick, don't you think?<p class="message sent">Definitely. That sounds like the perfect movie night.<p class=message>If you ever need any movie recommendations, I'm your go-to guy!<p class="message sent">I'll keep that in mind, A. Thanks for the chat and for keeping us safe here tonight.<p class=message>You're welcome, Lisa. Have a great night!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ef0da88c-79f1-4dea-8797-89f036cb6364.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
