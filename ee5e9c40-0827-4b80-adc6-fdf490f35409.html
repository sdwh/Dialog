Welcome to our vineyard.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me. I'm the wine taster. I can't wait to taste your wines.<p class=message>Great! Which wine would you like to start with?<p class="message sent">How about the red wine?<p class=message>Sure thing. This one is made with cabernet sauvignon grapes. It's been aged for two years in oak barrels.<p class="message sent">Smells delicious! Let me give it a try. (takes a sip) Wow, this is smooth and bold.<p class=message>I'm glad you like it. What about the white wine?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. Which grapes are used for this one?<p class=message>This is a chardonnay. It's been fermented in stainless steel tanks to maintain its fresh flavor.<p class="message sent">(tasting) Mmm, it has a crisp and fruity taste. Perfect for a sunny day!<p class=message>Exactly! Would you like to taste our rosé wine next?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. I'm curious to see how it compares to the red and white.<p class=message>Our rosé is made with a blend of merlot and cabernet franc grapes. It's a refreshing option for those who prefer a lighter wine.<p class="message sent">(tasting) This is a delightful surprise! It has a bright and fruity taste. I could easily drink this all summer long.<p class=message>I'm glad you enjoy it. Speaking of surprises, would you like to try our dessert wine?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes please! What's the name of this one?<p class=message>This is our ice wine. It's made with riesling grapes that have been frozen on the vine before being harvested.<p class="message sent">(sipping) This is amazing! The sweetness is perfectly balanced with the acidity. It's like having a dessert in a glass.<p class=message>I'm glad you like it. We're really proud of our ice wine. Do you have any questions about our winemaking process?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. How do you determine when it's time to harvest the grapes?<p class=message>It usually depends on the ripeness of the grapes, which is determined by their sugar levels. We also look at the acidity and pH levels. Once everything falls into place, we start the harvest.<p class="message sent">Fascinating! One last question, what's your personal favorite wine?<p class=message>That's a tough one. But if I had to choose, I would say our cabernet sauvignon. Its boldness really speaks to me.<p class="message sent">I can see why. It's a fantastic wine. Thank you so much for the tasting, and for answering my questions.<p class=message>Thank you for coming by. It's always a pleasure to share our passion with others. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ee5cd907-ac5d-4c08-9ce4-f0f58f4ef924.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
