Thanks for showing me around Kyoto's beautiful temples.<p class="message sent">Of course, always happy to show tourists around. Have you taken any good shots yet?<p class=message>Yes, I got some great photos of the cherry blossom trees at Kinkakuji Temple yesterday. Today, I want to capture some shots of the famous Kiyomizu-dera Temple.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Kiyomizu-dera is one of the most famous temples in Kyoto. It has a beautiful view of the city from its balcony.<p class=message>That's what I'm hoping to capture! So, what's the story behind the temple's name?<p class="message sent">The temple's name means "clear water" and it's derived from the Otowa Waterfall located within the temple grounds. It's said that the water has healing powers.<p class=message>Interesting! Speaking of water, do you know why the roof of the temple is made of wood and no nails were used?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually that's because the temple was built without any nails during the Edo period. They used a special interlocking technique to keep the structure together.<p class=message>Wow, the craftsmanship is amazing! I'm definitely going to mention that in my blog post.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! Speaking of which, what else are you planning to write about?<p class=message>Well, besides the history and architecture of the temple, I want to talk about the local food and souvenirs too. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Yes, you should try the matcha-flavored sweets and pick up some of the traditional pottery from the shops around the temple. It's all locally made and unique to Kyoto.<p class=message>Thanks for the tip! You've been an amazing tour guide so far. I'm glad I booked this tour with you.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, it's been a pleasure showing you around. I hope you have a great time exploring more of Kyoto's sights.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2b92ac03-f09d-4292-a148-93f8bfaf51d6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
