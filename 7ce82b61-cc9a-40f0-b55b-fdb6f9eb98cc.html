I wanted to check if the bathroom here has a bathtub.<p class="message sent">Hello! Yes, it does. And it's a pretty large one too.<p class=message>That's great news! I love taking long relaxing baths after a tiring day of sightseeing.<p class="message sent">Me too! In fact, I always make sure that I choose a hotel with a good bathtub.<p class=message>You and I have the same priorities when it comes to hotels then. How about the shower? Is it a rain showerhead?<p class="message sent">No, it's not. But the water pressure is pretty strong, so you'll still be able to get a good shower experience.<p class=message>That's good to know. How about toiletries? Are they provided?<p class="message sent">Yes, they are. There's a set of shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel in the shower area.<p class=message>Great! I can save some space in my toiletry bag then. By the way, have you tried the sauna here?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. It's pretty good. You should try it too!<p class=message>I definitely will. I heard that it's been a trend nowadays to go to bathhouses and try out saunas.<p class="message sent">Really? I didn't know that. But it's a great way to destress and relax.<p class=message>Yes, I agree. Do you have any other recommendations around here for relaxation?<p class="message sent">You can try the hotel's massage service. I heard it's pretty good too.<p class=message>I will definitely check that out. Thanks for your recommendations!<p class="message sent">No problem. Enjoy your stay here!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7ce6fe19-a37c-4981-a1c1-e4003f0d6612.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
