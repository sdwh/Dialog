I'm the manager for the F&B department of this hotel.<p class="message sent">Great to meet you! I'm a mixologist, a bartender that is known for creating unique cocktails.<p class=message>Well, I'm here to check out the new cocktails you've been experimenting with.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, I have some new flavors that I'm excited to try. What type of flavor do you prefer?<p class=message>I prefer something light and refreshing, but with a little bit of a kick.<p class="message sent">Alright, how about a citrus and herb cocktail with a splash of tequila?<p class=message>That sounds delicious! Let me try it.<p class=message>Wow, that's really good! The citrus and herbs are perfectly balanced.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it. I also have a whiskey-based cocktail with a hint of honey and ginger.<p class=message>I'd love to try that too.<p class=message>Mmm, the honey and ginger are a great combination with the whiskey.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I'm happy to hear that. I also have a non-alcoholic cocktail, would you like to try it?<p class=message>Of course, I'm curious to see what you can do with a mocktail.<p class=message>Amazing! It's just as delicious as the other cocktails, and without any alcohol.<p class="message sent">That's the beauty of mixology. Non-alcoholic drinks can be just as delicious as alcoholic beverages.<p class=message>It's been a pleasure trying your new creations, I'll definitely recommend them to our guests.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I appreciate it. Let me know if you need any more suggestions or want to try anything else.<p class=message>Will do, thanks again for the great cocktails.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4159f65e-51b5-4480-a092-692738c5c2f3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
