I heard you had a surgery yesterday, how are you feeling?<p class="message sent">Hey A! Yeah, it was a pretty intense experience, but I'm feeling much better now.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Who was your doctor for the surgery?<p class="message sent">Dr. Lee! She was amazing, I honestly couldn't have asked for a better surgeon.<p class=message>That's great! It's always comforting to have someone who knows what they're doing. What was the surgery for, if you don't mind me asking?<p class="message sent">It was just a minor one, I had to get my gallbladder removed.<p class=message>Ah, gotcha. Well, it's better to get those things taken care of before they become bigger issues.<p class="message sent">Yeah, definitely. Plus, the surgery itself was pretty interesting to watch! I got to see it on the monitor they had in the room.<p class=message>Really? That's pretty cool. Did you ask Dr. Lee any questions during the surgery?<p class="message sent">Haha, no, I didn't want to distract her. But she did explain what she was doing at certain points, and it was fascinating to learn more about the procedure.<p class=message>I bet! Did you have any funny or weird experiences while in the surgery room?<p class="message sent">Not really, the anesthesia knocked me out pretty quickly. But when I woke up, I saw Dr. Lee wearing this funny looking hat.<p class=message>Oh, really? What did it look like?<p class="message sent">It was a colorful cap with cartoon animals on it! It definitely made me laugh and put me at ease.<p class=message>Haha, that's great! Well, I'm glad your surgery went smoothly and you're on the road to recovery now.<p class="message sent">Yeah, me too. Thanks for checking in on me, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5658a99-06a9-4b23-9929-2f1e76991989.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
