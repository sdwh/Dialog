How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing great, thanks. Are you excited for your trip to Perth?<p class=message>Yes, I am! I've always wanted to visit Australia and experience its beautiful scenery.<p class="message sent">Well, you're going to love it. Perth has some of the best beaches and parks in the world!<p class=message>That sounds amazing! How long have you been a taxi driver here in the city?<p class="message sent">I've been driving taxis for about 10 years now. It's a great job because I get to meet new people all the time.<p class=message>Yes, that's definitely one of the perks of your job. Do you have any funny stories you can share about your passengers?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think... One time I picked up a group of tourists who were so excited about seeing kangaroos that they kept shouting "Kangaroo!" every time we passed a tree or a bush. It was pretty entertaining.<p class=message>Haha, that's hilarious! I hope I don't behave like that during my trip. Have you ever been to Perth yourself?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. My favorite memory was visiting the Fremantle Markets and trying out all the delicious food there.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard about that place! I can't wait to visit it myself. Do you have any recommendations for other must-see places in Perth?<p class="message sent">Definitely take a stroll along the Swan River and visit Kings Park. You'll get some amazing views of the city from there.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. Thank you so much for the recommendations, B. I'm sure this is going to be a great trip.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. We'll be there before you know it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=322740c1-4219-4418-9cf0-6915151e4d96.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
