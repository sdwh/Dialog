How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing pretty well, thanks. Hey, I wanted to share something pretty exciting with you.<p class="message sent">Sure, what is it?<p class=message>I recently passed the TOEIC Gold level exam!<p class="message sent">That's amazing, congratulations! I'm still working on passing the Silver level myself.<p class=message>You'll get there soon enough. It's not easy, but it's definitely doable with some practice.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know. But hearing your success definitely gives me some much-needed encouragement.<p class=message>I'm glad I can help! What about you? Have you accomplished anything lately that you're proud of?<p class="message sent">Actually, I've been putting a lot of effort into my pronunciation and I've been receiving some positive feedback lately.<p class=message>That's fantastic! Pronunciation can be tricky, but it's also essential for clear communication.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'm relieved to see that my hard work is paying off.<p class=message>You should be proud of yourself. It takes a lot of time and effort to make progress in a language.<p class="message sent">Thanks for saying that. It means a lot coming from someone who's already passed the Gold level.<p class=message>No problem, glad to help! And if you ever want to practice or go over any material together, just let me know.<p class="message sent">I appreciate that a lot. Maybe we can study some vocabulary together sometime.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. We can challenge each other to see who can remember the most words!<p class="message sent">You're on! And maybe someday, we can both reach the Platinum level!<p class=message>Hey, only time will tell. But with dedication and support from each other, I don't doubt that we can get there someday.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e6b159e-a6f2-4daa-9ade-3547d50d3c0c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
