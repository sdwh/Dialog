Welcome to the rainforest in Queensland. Are you excited for the eco-tour?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I've never been to a rainforest before, so I'm really looking forward to exploring.<p class=message>Great! We have a lot to see today. Are you ready to embark on a fun adventure?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. What do we have planned for today's eco-tour?<p class=message>We'll be walking down a nature trail for about an hour, and then we'll take a boat ride on the river for another hour.<p class="message sent">That sounds like fun. What kind of wildlife and plants should I expect to see?<p class=message>You'll get to see countless species of plants, including giant ferns and ancient trees that are thousands of years old. And who knows? You may also see some native animals, such as wallabies and koalas.<p class="message sent">Wow! That sounds amazing. Is there anything else I should know before we start the tour?<p class=message>Just make sure you stay hydrated and wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts and pants. The rainforest can get a bit humid.<p class="message sent">Got it. Thanks for the helpful tips. I can't wait to get started!<p class=message>Let's go then! And don't forget to keep an eye out for the butterflies. They're everywhere.<p class="message sent">Ok, I'll keep an eye out. Oh, look, there's a kookaburra bird. It's so cute!<p class=message>Yes, they are quite common in this area. Did you know that their unique laugh echoes throughout the rainforest?<p class="message sent">No way! That's so cool. This is truly a magical place. Thanks for showing me around.<p class=message>Anytime. I'm just glad you're enjoying yourself. We'll be arriving at the river soon, so let's pick up the pace!<p class="message sent">I'm right behind you. I can't wait to see what's next.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a64f2e7e-8550-4553-ae20-7414789ab35d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
