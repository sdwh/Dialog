Did you catch any bugs in the software yet?<p class="message sent">Hey A, it's going pretty well so far. I've found a few bugs here and there, but nothing too serious.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I've been working on fixing some of the issues you found earlier. Do you have any new ones to report?<p class="message sent">Actually, there is one that's been bugging me. Every time I try to open the settings menu, the software crashes.<p class=message>Hmm, that's definitely not supposed to happen. Let me take a look at the code and see what's causing that.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate it. In the meantime, have you heard about that new game that came out yesterday? It's supposed to be really good.<p class=message>Oh yeah, I've been meaning to check it out. I heard it's a combination of strategy and RPG elements.<p class="message sent">That's right! I played it for a few hours last night and I'm already hooked.<p class=message>Well, don't let me distract you from testing our own software. We can play that game later if we have time.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. I'll keep searching for any more bugs while you work on the settings issue.<p class=message>Great, I'll let you know when I have an update. Keep up the good work, B!<p class="message sent">Will do, A. Thanks for helping out with this software.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ebe50849-3d04-49c7-b64d-06a6b3404ba9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
