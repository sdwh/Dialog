Welcome to our restaurant. How may I assist you?<p class="message sent">Bonsoir! We would like to try the French cuisine. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Our special tonight is the duck a l'orange. It's cooked in a savory orange sauce that will awaken your taste buds.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Can we also order some wine to pair with the meal?<p class=message>Absolutely! May I suggest a glass of Chardonnay or a bottle of Pinot Noir?<p class="message sent">We'll go with the Pinot Noir, please. Thank you.<p class=message>Coming right up. While you're waiting, would you like to try our fresh baguette and butter?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. Is it made in-house?<p class=message>Yes, all of our breads are made fresh daily.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. So, how long have you been a chef?<p class=message>I've been working in the kitchen for over 20 years now. It's been my passion since I was young.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's dedication. What's your favorite dish to prepare?<p class=message>I love making anything with seafood. The coastal regions in France have some of the freshest seafood available.<p class="message sent">That's great to know. Speaking of seafood, what do you recommend for appetizers?<p class=message>The escargot in garlic butter or the mussels in white wine sauce are both popular choices.<p class="message sent">We'll have the escargot then. Thank you.<p class=message>My pleasure. How's the wine? Does it complement the bread well?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's perfect. We're enjoying the ambiance and the view outside as well.<p class=message>Thank you for the kind words. Our waitstaff take pride in providing excellent service.<p class="message sent">It shows. The whole experience has been delightful so far.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. Your duck a l'orange is ready. I hope you enjoy your meal.<p class="message sent">Thank you very much. We can't wait to dig in.<p class=message>Bon app√©tit!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=96f035c0-e399-4909-b905-c046405ab82a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
