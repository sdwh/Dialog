It's great to work with you on this project. As a network engineer, I believe we can work together to secure our network.<p class="message sent">Hi, A. I agree! As a network security engineer, I'm all about preventing network attacks. Let's hear your ideas first.<p class=message>Well, my top priority is ensuring our firewall is up to date and has all the necessary patches installed.<p class="message sent">That's a good start, but we also need to make sure our network is monitored 24/7 for any suspicious traffic.<p class=message>Definitely. I think we should also have some kind of intrusion detection system in place in case an attack goes undetected.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. Plus, we can run regular vulnerability assessments to find weaknesses before someone else does.<p class=message>Yes, we can't forget about training our employees on the importance of network security too.<p class="message sent">Exactly. Security awareness training is essential for everyone in the company, not just the IT department.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have you seen the latest phishing emails going around? They're getting pretty convincing.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's getting harder to spot them. We should send out a warning to everyone about these attacks.<p class=message>Definitely. Overall, we need to make sure our defenses are strong and work together to protect our network.<p class="message sent">Agreed, let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f8b19d9c-4468-4f61-9331-939a125c368b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
