I'm so thrilled to be here.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's one of my favorite places to take tourists. Have you seen the exhibit on the history of local art?<p class=message>No, not yet. What can you tell me about it?<p class="message sent">Well, it starts with the development of contemporary art after the Meiji Restoration, and goes all the way up to modern day with a focus on local artists.<p class=message>That sounds really interesting. As an artist myself, I'm always curious about the local art scenes in different cities.<p class="message sent">Oh, really? What kind of art do you make?<p class=message>I specialize in painting, mostly abstract and expressionism. How about you? Do you have any art background?<p class="message sent">Not really, but I appreciate art and enjoy learning about it. That's why I became a tour guide.<p class=message>I see. Do you have any favorite artists or art movements?<p class="message sent">Well, I love the work of Yayoi Kusama, who is originally from Japan. And I think impressionism is always a classic.<p class=message>Yes, Kusama is definitely an inspiration to many artists. And impressionism is definitely a crowd favorite.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Now let's head over to the contemporary exhibit. There's a really cool installation piece that I think you'll like.<p class=message>Sounds good to me.
