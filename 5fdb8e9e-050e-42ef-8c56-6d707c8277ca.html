Have you heard about ISO 27001 Security Incident Report (SIR)?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. It's basically the report that tells us if there's a security breach, right?<p class=message>You're right! And do you know that it's so important to follow procedures to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data?<p class="message sent">I know, I know. But it sounds so serious and boring.<p class=message>I understand, but let me tell you this: following ISO 27001 can actually increase our company's trustworthiness and credibility.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. How do we prepare the SIR?<p class=message>Well, first we have to identify and evaluate the incident, then classify it based on its impact, and finally document it in the report.<p class="message sent">Got it, sounds pretty straightforward. But how do we prevent incidents from happening?<p class=message>We can implement preventive measures such as access controls, encryption, and continuous monitoring.<p class="message sent">Ha! I'm feeling more secure already! By the way, can you tell me a funny SIR story?<p class=message>Hmmm, let me think. Oh, here's one: A colleague accidentally spilled coffee on his laptop, but he reported it as a security incident. It turns out, the coffee was the least of his worries because we found out he was using an unsecured Wi-Fi connection.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's hilarious! I hope he learned his lesson.<p class=message>Definitely! So, what do you think? Are you ready to become an ISO 27001 security pro?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's show those hackers who's boss.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5fdad1ad-fe58-4abe-8a85-d3821fb68f08.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
