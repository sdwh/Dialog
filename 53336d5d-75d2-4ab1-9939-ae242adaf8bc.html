How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey, A. It's going well. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. I'm just here to talk about network security and risk management.<p class="message sent">Sounds like fun. What are your thoughts?<p class=message>Well, one of the biggest risks we face is phishing attacks. Have you seen an increase in those?<p class="message sent">Yeah, unfortunately. We've been training our employees to be more vigilant, but it's still a concern.<p class=message>It certainly is. Another thing to watch out for is ransomware. Have you had any experience with that?<p class="message sent">Not personally, but I know it's a growing threat. Are there any best practices you recommend for preventing ransomware attacks?<p class=message>Absolutely. First and foremost, always have a backup of your data. And regularly update your security software. It's also important to restrict access to sensitive data.<p class="message sent">Good advice. Do you have any fun tips for keeping security top of mind?<p class=message>Well, you could always host a security-themed movie night with classics like "The Matrix" or "WarGames." And have a "phishbowl" where employees can report suspicious emails for a chance to win a prize.<p class="message sent">Haha, I like the sound of that. Maybe we should try it out. Thanks, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to help out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=533284af-23c3-49ad-abd6-68be3dd79ef1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
