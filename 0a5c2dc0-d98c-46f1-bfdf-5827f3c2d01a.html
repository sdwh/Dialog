Welcome to Miami Beach Hotel. How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent message-content">Hi there! I have a reservation under the name John Smith.<p class="message received message-content">Let me check on that for you. Yes, Mr. Smith, we have you booked for a deluxe room with an ocean view. Would you like me to show you to your room?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, please. That would be great.<p class="message received message-content">Lovely! Before I hand you your key, could you kindly fill out this registration form for me?<p class="message sent message-content">Sure, no problem.<p class="message received message-content">Thank you. And may I offer you a complimentary glass of Champagne to welcome you to the hotel?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, that's very kind of you. Yes, I'll take one.<p class="message received message-content">Here you go! Now, if you'll just follow me, I'll show you to your room.<p class="message sent message-content">This is a beautiful hotel. How long have you been working here?<p class="message received message-content">Thank you. I've been here for about two years now. It's a wonderful place to work.<p class="message sent message-content">I bet it is. I've always wanted to visit Miami. Any recommendations for things to do while I'm here?<p class="message received message-content">Well, the beaches are a must-see, of course. And there are also some great restaurants and shopping areas nearby. Have you heard of Lincoln Road?<p class="message sent message-content">No, I haven't. What's that?<p class="message received message-content">It's an outdoor mall with lots of shops and restaurants. It's a great place to spend an afternoon.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds perfect. Thanks for the tip.<p class="message received message-content">You're welcome! And if you need anything during your stay, don't hesitate to let us know.<p class="message sent message-content">Thanks, I will. This looks like a great room. I think I'll go take a nap now and then explore later.<p class="message received message-content">Perfect. Have a wonderful stay with us, Mr. Smith!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0a52a4ea-6951-4134-9237-3de9ca5064a4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
