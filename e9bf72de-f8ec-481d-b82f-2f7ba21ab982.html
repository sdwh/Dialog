What brings you to the harbor today?<p class=message>I was thinking about the future of the fishing industry. Have you considered how it might change?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. The industry has adapted to new challenges before and it will continue to do so.<p class=message>I think sustainability will be key moving forward. We need to fish responsibly and protect our oceans.<p class="message sent">Yes, and I think there will be an increasing demand for locally caught and sustainable seafood.<p class=message>That's a good point. Restaurant and grocery store buyers want to know where their seafood comes from.<p class="message sent">I also think technology will play a major role in the future. Improved fish tracking and automated processing could make us more efficient.<p class=message>That's true, but we don't want to lose the human touch either. Personal relationships and expertise will always be important.<p class="message sent">You're right. Fishing is a tradition and a way of life for many of us. We need to embrace new ideas while also preserving our values.<p class=message>Couldn't have said it better myself. The future of the fishing industry is bright with the right balance of innovation and sustainability.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's do our part and lead the way.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e9beb65f-9c69-4ee5-b261-3a15bf4224ad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
