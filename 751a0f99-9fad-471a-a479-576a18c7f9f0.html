I'm your guide, Alice. Before we start our tour, let me know if any of you have specific requests.<p class="message sent">Hi, Alice. This is my first time here, can you tell me what makes this destination unique?<p class=message>Sure! It's famous for its picturesque scenery and vibrant culture. You'll see stunning landscapes and interact with friendly locals.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! Is there anything we should be aware of in terms of customs or etiquette?<p class=message>Yes, the locals are quite conservative, so it's best to dress modestly and ask before taking photos. Also, don't be afraid to try the local cuisine, it's a big part of the experience.<p class="message sent">Great, thanks for the heads up. And what's the most popular activity to do here?<p class=message>It really depends on your interests, but I highly recommend taking a river cruise. You'll get to see the beauty of the place from a unique perspective.<p class="message sent">Sounds like fun! How long is the cruise?<p class=message>It's about 2 hours long, but we can customize it to your liking.<p class="message sent">I'm in! What's the best time to take the cruise?<p class=message>The morning is usually the best time because the water is calmer and the sun isn't too hot yet. Are you all ready to start the tour?<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it!<p class=message>Alright, let's go! Don't forget to bring your cameras and your sense of adventure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7518980e-872c-4493-935f-4504b30ed0ed.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
