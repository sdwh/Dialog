It seems like you're working hard over here. What kind of candy are you making today?<p class="message sent">Hey! I'm making traditional Chaozhou candy. It's quite popular in this region of Guangdong. Would you like to sample some?<p class=message>Yes, please. Wow, this is really delicious. Can you tell me how you make it?<p class="message sent">Sure. It starts with mixing maltose and sugar, and then adding some water and starch. We then boil it until it thickens and pull and fold the mixture until it forms a soft, chewy texture.<p class=message>That sounds complicated. How long have you been making candy?<p class="message sent">I've been making candy for over twenty years now. It's quite a tricky process, but it's definitely worth it when you see the final product.<p class=message>I can imagine. Do you know how many different types of candy exist in Chaozhou?<p class="message sent">There are too many to count! Each candy represents a different story or legend, and each has its unique flavor and texture.<p class=message>That's really interesting. How do you usually sell your candy?<p class="message sent">I sell them at my own shop, and also supply them to other shops in the area. It's a thriving business.<p class=message>If I wanted to start making candy, what advice would you give me?<p class="message sent">Well, patience and attention to detail is key. You have to be willing to put in long hours and experiment with recipes until you find the perfect flavor and texture.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. I'll definitely keep that in mind. And thank you for letting me try your delicious candy.<p class="message sent">No problem! It's always great to share the joy of Chaozhou candy with others.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=834daaee-53bb-4f59-9542-b7f28ebc7b05.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
