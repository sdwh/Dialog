How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm good, thanks for asking! It's been busy since we opened the restaurant this morning.<p class=message>Yeah, I see a lot of customers coming in. Thankfully, we have enough ingredients to fill their orders.<p class="message sent">Speaking of ingredients, have you tried the spicy kimchi soup that we just prepared?<p class=message>Not yet, but it smells heavenly. How spicy is it?<p class="message sent">It definitely has a kick but it's not unbearable. Want me to get you a bowl?<p class=message>Absolutely! And while you're at it, can you bring a bottle of soju as well? It's always a good match with soup.<p class="message sent">Will do. By the way, have you heard about the K-pop group BTS?<p class=message>Of course! They're one of the biggest music sensations in the world right now.<p class="message sent">I know, right? And did you know that their favorite Korean dish is grilled pork belly?<p class=message>No way! I can't blame them, though. It's one of the most mouth-watering dishes we have on the menu.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Hey, speaking of mouth-watering, our customer over there just posted a photo of his bibimbap on social media. It looks so delicious!<p class=message>Wow, that's great marketing for us. I hope he enjoyed it.<p class="message sent">I think he did based on the thumbs up he gave us. Now, let's get back to work. We have more customers waiting for us.<p class=message>Right. I'll take care of grilling the beef while you assist our VIP guests.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. We make a great team, don't we?<p class=message>Definitely. We always bring out the best in each other.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b2dfba60-3056-4d21-9fdc-e044d1365b28.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
