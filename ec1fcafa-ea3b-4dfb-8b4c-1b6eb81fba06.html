I heard you're a great fish chef. What do you think of our local fish here in Fukuoka?<p class="message sent">Hello, A! It's nice to meet you. Yes, I've been excited to work with the local fish. The quality is excellent here and I can't wait to experiment.<p class=message>That's great to hear! We have some specialty dishes here that use local fish. Have you tried mentaiko?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's delicious! I'm thinking of incorporating it into a new seafood dish for our customers.<p class=message>Sounds like a great idea! While you're cooking, I'll make sure to pair it with some local drinks. How about some sake or shochu?<p class="message sent">That would be perfect! I love trying out new drinks. What do you recommend?<p class=message>For sake, we have Dassai and Isojiman. As for shochu, we have Satsuma Shiranami and Iichiko.<p class="message sent">They all sound delicious! Let's try them all.<p class=message>(laughs) Sure, why not? Oh, by the way, have you tried our local ramen yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard great things about Hakata ramen. I'm excited to try it.<p class=message>You won't regret it! It's a must-try dish when visiting Fukuoka.<p class="message sent">I can't wait! After a long day of cooking, a bowl of ramen and a cold beer sound perfect.<p class=message>Agreed! And if you're feeling adventurous, we also have some specialty offal dishes that go great with beer.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not sure if I'm up for that. But I'll give it a try!<p class=message>(laughs) That's the spirit! It's all about trying new things and experiencing the local culture.<p class="message sent">Exactly! I'm grateful for this opportunity to learn more about Fukuoka's cuisine and culture.<p class=message>We're glad to have you here, B. Let's keep experimenting and have fun!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ec1a032f-7062-4f82-a597-e4fd066f0041.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
