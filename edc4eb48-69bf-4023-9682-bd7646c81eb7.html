I'm the lead auditor for this ISO 27001 audit. How's it going on your end, B?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Everything's going smoothly. We've been working hard to ensure we meet all the requirements.<p class=message>That's great to hear! I can see all the preparation that went into this from your end. You definitely take your system management job seriously.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! It's important for us to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information assets.<p class=message>Absolutely! And it's also important to have some fun while doing it. By the way, have you seen that IT meme that's been making rounds on the internet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it about?<p class=message>It's a picture of a computer with a caption that reads, "I put tape over my laptop camera because even the FBI agent assigned to watch me deserves some privacy."<p class="message sent">(Laughs) That's hilarious! It reminds me of how we have to take extra precautions to ensure our own privacy.<p class=message>Yeah, I know right? You can never be too careful with these things. Speaking of which, have you updated all the systems with the latest security patches?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have. We even conducted vulnerability scans just to make sure we caught any potential loopholes.<p class=message>Great job, B! I can see how dedicated you are to making sure everything goes smoothly. Keep it up!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I'm really enjoying working with you. It's nice to work with someone who balances work and fun.<p class=message>(Smiles) That's what auditing is all about, B. Ensuring everything is done properly while still having a good time with it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=edc4175e-25d6-46a0-acc7-74f3e8a48571.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
