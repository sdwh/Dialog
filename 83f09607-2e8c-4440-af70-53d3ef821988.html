I was wondering if you could help me book a tee time for the golf course?<p class="message sent">Of course! We have a wonderful 18-hole golf course on the property. Our available tee times start at 8 am until 4 pm. Which time works best for you?<p class=message>I was thinking around 10 am would be perfect. How long do the rounds usually take?<p class="message sent">It generally takes about four hours to complete a round, but we recommend allowing five hours to enjoy the amazing views and a bite to eat at our on-course restaurant.<p class=message>That sounds great! How much does it cost to play a round?<p class="message sent">Our fees vary depending on the time of day and day of the week, but the standard rate is $100 per golfer. However, we do offer discounts for hotel guests.<p class=message>That sounds reasonable. Do I need to bring my own clubs, or can I rent them from the course?<p class="message sent">We have a wide selection of rental clubs available for golfers of all skill levels at a very reasonable price. You can also bring your own clubs if you prefer.<p class=message>Perfect! Do you have any special rules or dress codes that I should be aware of?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do have a dress code that requires collared shirts, golf slacks or shorts, and appropriate footwear. Additionally, please refrain from using metal spikes on your shoes.<p class=message>Got it, thanks for letting me know. Is there anything else I should know before heading out to the course?<p class="message sent">Just be sure to check in at the pro shop at least 30 minutes before your tee time to pay your fees, receive your scorecard, and get started on a fantastic round of golf!<p class=message>Thanks for your help, I can't wait to hit the links!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=83ef5e22-934f-48f1-a3d0-899956e0ebba.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
