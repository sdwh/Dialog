I couldn't help but notice you seem to be working on the luggage area. Mind if I ask a few questions about the baggage process?<p class="message sent">Hey! Sure thing! I am more than happy to assist you. What would you like to know?<p class=message>Well, for instance, why does luggage sometimes get lost or delayed? It can be quite frustrating for passengers.<p class="message sent">Ah, I understand your concern. Usually, it happens when the tag on the luggage gets damaged or the barcode gets unreadable.<p class=message>That makes sense. Is there any way to prevent luggage from getting lost?<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed. Always make sure you tag your luggage properly and double-check the information on the tag, especially the destination.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. How about carry-on luggage? What are the restrictions on that?<p class="message sent">For most airlines, you are allowed one carry-on bag and one personal item, such as a laptop bag or purse. The size and weight limit may vary, so be sure to check your airline's policy.<p class=message>Got it. I'll make sure to remember that. Is there anything else I should know?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. It's always best to keep valuable items and medications in your carry-on bag, just in case your checked luggage gets delayed or lost.<p class=message>Very helpful tips. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me about this. You're a great help!<p class="message sent">No problem at all! Anytime! And good luck with your work on the plane!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=da832976-871c-40dd-a035-9445985c6f15.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
