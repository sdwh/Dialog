I'm really excited about this trip to Australia.<p class="message sent">Welcome aboard! Where are you from?<p class=message>I'm from Japan. Have you ever been there?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had the chance yet. But I heard it's a beautiful place with amazing food.<p class=message>Yes, our food is really delicious. But Australia has some great food too, right?<p class="message sent">Definitely! You must try some meat pies and Tim Tams while you're here.<p class=message>I'll make sure to do that. How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm a Uber driver. It's been almost 2 years now. And you, what do you do?<p class=message>I'm a software engineer. I'm hoping to take a break and enjoy some adventure sports in Gold Coast.<p class="message sent">Oh, you'll love it here. There are so many activities to choose from like surfing, skydiving and bungee jumping.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a lot of adrenaline rush. I'm not sure I'm ready for that!<p class="message sent">Don't worry, you can always start with some easy activities like paddle boarding or kayaking.<p class=message>That sounds much better. So, how much longer until we reach our destination?<p class="message sent">We're about half an hour away. You can relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery outside.<p class=message>Thanks, I will. I heard the beaches in Gold Coast are amazing.<p class="message sent">Yes, they are. The water is crystal clear and the sand is so soft. You should definitely spend some time on the beach.<p class=message>I'm planning to do that. And maybe go for a hike in the hinterland too.<p class="message sent">Great, you'll love the scenery there. We're almost there, by the way.<p class=message>Okay, awesome. Thank you for the ride and all the advice. I'm looking forward to my trip even more now.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Have a great time in Gold Coast.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f4ff8ec-1db7-4c55-bc34-6f9fe318e8ed.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
