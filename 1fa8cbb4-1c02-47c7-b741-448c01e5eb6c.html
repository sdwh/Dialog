I was wondering if you could help me out with something?<p class="message sent">Of course! What can I assist you with today?<p class=message>Well, I recently bought this dress and I absolutely love it, but it's a bit too long for my liking.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, we have an alterations department that can take care of that for you.<p class=message>That's great! How long do you think it will take?<p class="message sent">It usually takes around 3-4 business days, but if you need it sooner we can try to expedite the process for you.<p class=message>Oh, that won't be necessary. I don't have any events coming up for a couple of weeks.<p class="message sent">Perfect. So, let's take a look at the dress and see what alterations need to be made.<p class=message>Sounds good to me.<p class="message sent">Okay, we will have to hem the dress about 4 inches shorter. Is that okay with you?<p class=message>Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking too!<p class="message sent">Great, we will make a note of that and get it taken care of. Do you need anything else while you're here?<p class=message>No, that's all for now. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Don't hesitate to ask if you need anything else in the future.<p class=message>Definitely will do. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You too! Take care.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1fa747d7-7fd1-473b-9a3b-a554437600d0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
