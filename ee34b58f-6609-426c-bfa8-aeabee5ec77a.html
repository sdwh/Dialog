Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm the bubble tea maker. Likewise.<p class=message>I've never tried bubble tea before. What are your recommendations?<p class="message sent">Our classic is milk tea with pearls, but we also have different flavors like mango, strawberry, and matcha.<p class=message>Hmm, I think I'll try the classic first. What about noodles? What's your specialty?<p class="message sent">Our most popular dish is the beef noodle soup. It's hearty and savory, perfect for a chilly day.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. How do you make your noodles?<p class="message sent">We use a mix of wheat and rice flour and add in some egg and water. Then we knead the dough until it's smooth and stretch it out into thin noodles.<p class=message>That's impressive. I've never been able to make my noodles that thin. How long have you been making noodles?<p class="message sent">I've been making noodles for about 3 years now. It's a satisfying job, seeing customers enjoy something you've made from scratch.<p class=message>I understand that feeling. I've been a noodle maker for 5 years. It's incredible how versatile noodles can be. You can have them in soup, stir-fried, or even cold with a sauce.<p class="message sent">Yes, and bubble tea is also versatile. You can have it hot or cold, with or without toppings. It's amazing how creative people can be with their bubble tea orders.<p class=message>Speaking of creativity, have you ever tried mixing noodles and bubble tea together?<p class="message sent">(laughs) No, but now you've got me curious.<p class=message>Maybe we should experiment and see if it's a hit with our customers.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Sounds like a plan. Let's hope they're adventurous eaters.<p class=message>Absolutely. But even if it's a flop, it'll still be a fun experience. That's the beauty of trying new things.<p class="message sent">You're right. It's all about having fun and learning from the experience.<p class=message>Well said. Okay, time to cook up some noodles and make some bubble tea. Let's impress our customers with our skills!<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ee313a74-7e17-4dc4-aeca-dd0dbc029e4a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
