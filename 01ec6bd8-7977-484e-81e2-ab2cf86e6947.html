I heard you're working on a new project.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's an ISO 27001 audit. I'm trying to write up the audit plan for it.<p class=message>Well, that sounds like fun. You know, I always find it difficult to create an audit plan that's both detailed and interesting.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's definitely a challenge. I think the key is to strike a balance between technical jargon and plain language.<p class=message>Absolutely. And don't forget the importance of a good title. Something like "Staying Safe in the Digital Age: An ISO 27001 Audit" would be both catchy and informative.<p class="message sent">I like it. And what about the scope?<p class=message>Good point. Maybe you could include a diagram of the company's network and highlight the areas that will be audited.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. And how about the timeline?<p class=message>Hmm, well, it depends on the size of the company and the scope of the audit. But I suggest setting a reasonable deadline, so the staff members won't feel overwhelmed.<p class="message sent">You're right. It's important to keep everyone informed and engaged as much as possible.<p class=message>Exactly. And don't forget to emphasize the importance of the audit and how it will help the company in the long run.<p class="message sent">Yes, I'll definitely include that. Thanks for the helpful tips, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Good luck with the audit plan!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=01ebba22-920c-463e-938d-199283aec317.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
