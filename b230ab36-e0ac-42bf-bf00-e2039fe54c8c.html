That's amazing! I'm sure the patients must love it.<p class=message>Yes, she's a talented nurse. She sings really well, and she always brings a smile on the patients' faces.<p class="message sent">That's so cool. I wish I had a chance to be taken care of by her.<p class=message>Hey, we both can sing too, maybe we should form a band and perform for the patients!<p class="message sent">Ha ha, I'm not sure about that, but I'll definitely do my best to make them feel better.<p class=message>That's what matters most. So, how's your breakfast? Does it taste good?<p class="message sent">Actually, it's quite bland. But it's better than not having anything to eat.<p class=message>I know what you mean. Hospital food is not always the best, but it's important to eat and regain your health.<p class="message sent">True, I can't wait to be discharged and have a proper meal outside.<p class=message>Yeah, and I can't wait to go home and rest after a long shift. But first, let's do our best to make their day a little bit brighter.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's bring some joy to this hospital!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b226ba57-6662-4a4d-a976-9f5dec13131a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
