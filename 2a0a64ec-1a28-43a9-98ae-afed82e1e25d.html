Ready to get started on the ISO 27001 audit?<p class=message>Absolutely! Have you noticed any areas of concern that we should pay special attention to?<p class="message sent">Well, I've noticed there's been a lot of emails sent back and forth without proper encryption.<p class=message>Ah, yes. That's definitely something we should address. On a lighter note, have you tried the new coffee shop down the street?<p class="message sent">Funny you mention that, I actually went there this morning. It's really good!<p class=message>Nice, I've been meaning to check it out. So, getting back to the audit, have you noticed any physical security risks we should be aware of?<p class="message sent">Well, there's a door on the second floor that doesn't always lock properly. We should make sure that's fixed.<p class=message>Okay, noted. By the way, did you hear about the IT department's softball game last weekend?<p class="message sent">No, what happened?<p class=message>They lost pretty badly, but it sounds like they had a lot of fun anyway.<p class="message sent">Ha! Well, as long as they had fun, that's all that matters. Back to the audit, have you reviewed the password policies yet?<p class=message>Yes, and I think we need to make some updates to ensure stronger passwords are being used.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. And hey, speaking of passwords, have you ever played that game where you have to guess someone's password based on clues?<p class=message>No, but it sounds like a fun challenge. Maybe we could try it for team building sometime.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Alright, let's get back to work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a09ce88-003f-4c04-8cfc-d7c7dfacb878.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
