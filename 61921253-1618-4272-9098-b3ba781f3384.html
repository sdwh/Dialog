Where to today?<p class="message sent">Morning! I want to see the city's best sights in the shortest time possible. Can you help me?<p class=message>Of course! What are you interested in seeing?<p class="message sent">Well, I heard about the graffiti alleys and street art around here. Can we visit there first?<p class=message>No problem, we'll take you to Hosier Lane. It's one of the best places to see street art and graffiti in Melbourne.<p class="message sent">That's great news! After that, can we head to the Queen Victoria Market? I'd love to do some shopping.<p class=message>Perfect! The market is a great place to experience the hustle and bustle of Melbourne's daily life.<p class="message sent">I heard that you guys have amazing coffee too. Any recommendations?<p class=message>Absolutely! You should try Melbourne's famous coffee place, Degraves Espresso Bar. It's just a short walk away from the market.<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic! You're a big help, thank you.<p class=message>No problem at all! Happy to assist. What else would you like to visit?<p class="message sent">Hmm... maybe the Melbourne Cricket Ground? I'd love to see where the Aussies play their cricket.<p class=message>Sure thing! The MCG is a must-see attraction in Melbourne. You'll love it.<p class="message sent">Awesome! Can we also go to St. Kilda beach and have some ice cream and enjoy the scenic views?<p class=message>That's a great idea! You'll enjoy the beautiful stretch of sand and sunsets at St. Kilda.
