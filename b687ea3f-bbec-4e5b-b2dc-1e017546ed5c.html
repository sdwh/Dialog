Thank you for joining us for this press conference. How has your day been so far?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. It's been quite busy, but I'm always happy to make time for the media.<p class=message>I appreciate that. So, I hear you've been pushing for some new policies lately. Can you tell us a bit more about that?<p class="message sent">Yes, absolutely. One of my main focuses right now is environmental conservation. We need to start taking better care of our planet and make sure we leave a sustainable future for the next generation.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. It's great to see politicians taking action on such an important issue. But, let me ask you something a bit more lighthearted. What's your favorite hobby outside of work?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a good one. I actually love to go fishing. It's a great way to relax and clear my mind.<p class=message>Fishing, huh? I've never been much of an angler myself, but maybe you could give me some tips sometime.<p class="message sent">Of course! I'd be happy to take you out on the water and teach you some of my tricks.<p class=message>That sounds like a plan. Alright, one more question before we wrap up. If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would it be?<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough question. I think I'd love to have a conversation with Abraham Lincoln. He was such a wise and influential leader.<p class=message>That's a great answer. Thank you for taking the time to chat with us today, Mr. B.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, A. Thanks for having me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b685bad6-069a-41db-b995-6e61bfd558a3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
