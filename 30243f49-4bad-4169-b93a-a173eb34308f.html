How's your day going, driver?<p class="message sent">Not bad at all, sir. Couldn't complain.<p class=message>That's good to hear. So, do you have any good recommendations for things to do around here?<p class="message sent">Oh sure, there's plenty to do. You might want to visit the Australian War Memorial or see some wallabies at Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve.<p class=message>Oh, wow! That sounds amazing. How about local cuisine? Any recommendations for a good restaurant to try?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! If you're in the mood for some meat pies, I'd suggest giving Dobinsons Bakery Cafe a try or maybe the famous Bentspoke Brewery if you're after a good cold beer.<p class=message>Thanks a lot! How long have you been driving taxis in Canberra for?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for about 5 years now. It's a good line of work and there's always something new to see.<p class=message>That sounds really interesting. Do you have any funny stories or interesting encounters from your work?<p class="message sent">Well, I did once have someone ask if they could bring their pet rooster along for the ride! Needless to say, I had to decline that one.<p class=message>Haha, that's hilarious! I can't even imagine. Thanks for sharing that story with me.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, sir. It's always good to share a laugh. We're just about to arrive at your destination. Will there be anything else you require?<p class=message>No, that will be all. Thanks for the great ride and the helpful tips. Have a good day!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, sir. You have a good day too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=30234469-c68f-4c4f-b31a-7a3e1abb1d39.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
