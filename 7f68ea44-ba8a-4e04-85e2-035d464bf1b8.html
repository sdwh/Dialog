The smell of freshly roasted coffee beans is so inviting.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Yes, we just received these beans from a local roaster in Central America.<p class=message>That's amazing. How long have you been in the coffee business?<p class="message sent">I started this coffee shop around six years ago. How about you?<p class=message>I have been roasting coffee for almost a decade now. I love experimenting with different blends.<p class="message sent">That's great! Would you like to try these new beans and give me your feedback on the roast?<p class=message>Sure, I would love to. Oh, the aroma is so tantalizing! Let me grind some of these beans and brew a cup.<p class="message sent">Take your time. I must say you are an expert in roasting coffee beans.<p class=message>Thank you. I believe that the secret to great coffee lies in selecting the right beans and roasting them with care.<p class="message sent">I totally agree. You know, our regulars can't start their day without a cup of coffee at our shop.<p class=message>That's a sign of a successful coffee shop.<p class="message sent">By the way, I have a funny story. Yesterday, a customer ordered a "tall" coffee cup three times, thinking it means "medium" size.<p class=message>(laughs) It happens all the time. I remember a customer once ordered a "double shot of decaf espresso" which was a bit ironic to me.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, I can understand that. So, do you have any exciting new blends in mind?<p class=message>Actually, I'm working on a new blend that has hints of chocolate and nuts. I hope you'll love it.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to try it. Thank you for stopping by and giving me your feedback.<p class=message>My pleasure, B. It's always a pleasure to have a chat with a fellow coffee lover like you. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You too, A. Don't forget to take some roasted beans with you.<p class=message>Thanks! See you soon, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7f68b9dd-4b15-458d-960f-4df0ac6b73ca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
