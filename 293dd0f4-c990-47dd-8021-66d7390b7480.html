I know it's something about security but not much beyond that.<p class=message>Well, it's an international standard for information security management. It helps organizations protect sensitive information and reduce risks.<p class="message sent">Oh, okay. That sounds pretty important.<p class=message>Definitely. It covers everything from data protection to physical security to IT governance. It's a comprehensive approach to security.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a lot to cover. Is it hard to implement?<p class=message>It can be a bit challenging, but it's worth it in the end. You end up with a robust security framework that can help you avoid breaches and protect your reputation.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, but is it just for big companies or can smaller businesses benefit too?<p class=message>Actually, it's designed for organizations of all sizes. Small businesses can benefit from it just as much as large ones.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I guess with so many cyber threats out there, it's good to have some guidance on how to keep our information safe.<p class=message>Absolutely. And with ISO 27001, you can be sure you're following best practices and staying on top of the latest security measures.<p class="message sent">Cool, thanks for explaining it to me. I'll have to look into it more.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=29399241-98aa-4b9f-ba52-061a140c554a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
