Are you ready to teach the secrets of authentic Thai red-braised pork today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Manager A! Of course, I'm excited to show you how to make the perfect blend of spices and achieve that juicy texture.<p class=message>Great! Let's start by preparing the ingredients together. I see you have some shallots and garlic. How finely should we chop them?<p class="message sent">For the shallots, we want them small enough to caramelise nicely, so we'll dice them. As for the garlic, mince them as finely as possible.<p class=message>Okay, got it. I'll pass you the diced pork belly now. How many pieces do we need?<p class="message sent">About 5-6 pieces per person should be enough. And remember to score the fat with a cross-hatch cut, so that it renders down nicely.<p class=message>Noted. Shall we move on to the spice mix?<p class="message sent">Sure. We need cinnamon, star anise, cardamom, and a tiny bit of clove. Crush them slightly and put them in a cheesecloth bundle.<p class=message>That smells amazing already! We also need some tamarind juice, palm sugar, and fish sauce, right?<p class="message sent">That's right. The tamarind gives the sourness, while the sugar balances the flavors. The fish sauce adds that umami kick.<p class=message>This is starting to get me hungry. How long should we simmer the pork for?<p class="message sent">2-3 hours over low heat should be perfect. That's when the meat will be fork-tender and infused with all the fragrant spices.<p class=message>Wow, I can't wait to try it. Shall we move on to the side dishes now?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. We'll make some stir-fried morning glory and some sticky rice. For the morning glory, we'll just blanch it and stir-fry with garlic and oyster sauce.<p class=message>Sounds simple enough. And how about the sticky rice?<p class="message sent">It needs to be soaked overnight and steamed for about 20-25 minutes. Then, let it rest for another 10 minutes to get that perfect texture.<p class=message>I think I'm getting the hang of it. Thanks for showing me all of this, Chef B. It's been a fun and delicious learning experience.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, Manager A. It's always great to share our culinary knowledge and passion with others. And remember, the key to good food is always putting your heart into it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fc23590d-07e3-498f-a274-d0f95a5f50c2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
