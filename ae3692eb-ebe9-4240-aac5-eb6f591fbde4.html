Nice to meet you. I'm a fisherman around here.<p class="message sent">Hey! Welcome! It's an honor to meet you. I'm the owner of this seafood restaurant. I'm always on the lookout for the freshest catch.<p class=message>Well, lucky for you, I have a fresh catch today. Just got back from the ocean.<p class="message sent">That's great news! What do you have for me?<p class=message>I have some delicious prawns, lobsters, and crabs that you might be interested in.<p class="message sent">Oh, lovely! How about we sit down and discuss what you have in detail? We could have a look at our menu and figure out what would be a good fit.<p class=message>Sounds perfect to me. I'm always searching for new markets to sell my product, and yours seems to be a great fit.<p class="message sent">We do pride ourselves on using only the freshest seafood in our dishes. That's why buying from local suppliers like you is ideal.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. As a fisherman, it's always nice to know that my catch is appreciated.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm sure we could include some unique dishes on our menu with your catch. Maybe some spicy lobster rolls or buttered prawns.<p class=message>Those sound great. And if you ever need any help with cooking or preparing them, just let me know.<p class="message sent">Awesome, thank you! We appreciate your dedication to providing us with the freshest seafood. It's businesses like yours that help keep us going.<p class=message>My pleasure! It's always been my passion to fish and provide the community with some of the finest seafood around.<p class="message sent">You know, I'm wondering if you might have any of those secret family recipes for seasoning or cooking these seafood items?<p class=message>Haha, sorry to say, but those are going to have to remain a secret. I can always show you a few tricks of the trade though.<p class="message sent">Perfect! Let's get this partnership started. You can count on us to provide your catch with the care and appreciation it deserves.<p class=message>Likewise. Let's make some delicious dishes together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ae3404ff-61f2-41bb-b64e-5d0a31187e75.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
