I'm the network engineer assigned to work on improving our school's network system. Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, nice to meet you too! I'm the systems administrator. So, where do we start?<p class=message>Well, I believe we should assess the current state of the network first. How has it been performing lately?<p class="message sent">It's been a little slow during peak hours when a lot of students are online. We've also had reports of intermittent connectivity issues.<p class=message>Ah, yes. That's a common problem in educational institutions. Have you considered upgrading the hardware or increasing bandwidth?<p class="message sent">That's something we've thought about. We're just worried about the cost.<p class=message>I understand, but investing in reliable and fast internet service is crucial for a quality educational experience. Maybe we could explore some options and compare prices.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good plan. How about we also look at implementing a content filtering system to block certain websites and protect students from inappropriate content?<p class=message>Yes, that's definitely a priority. We'll need to configure the firewall and set up rules for different user groups.<p class="message sent">And what about security protocols? We need to make sure the network is protected from cyber threats.<p class=message>Absolutely. We'll need to run regular security scans and update the software and firmware on all devices.<p class="message sent">This is going to be a lot of work, but I'm excited to see the improvements we can make. Thanks for your help, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Let's get started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9cb9d361-0743-4ef8-9e98-bb9a6d0b05d1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
