Are you enjoying the development work on this MacOS app?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing great. Yes, I'm really enjoying working on this app. It's challenging, but fun.<p class=message>Yeah, absolutely. By the way, have you had any chance to explore the new features of MacOS Catalina?<p class="message sent">I haven't had the time yet. Have you?<p class=message>Yes, I love the new sidecar feature. Now, I can use my iPad as a second screen for my MacBook. It's awesome!<p class="message sent">Wow, that's cool! I will definitely give it a try once we are done with this release.<p class=message>Sure, let's plan for it. By the way, what's your favourite productivity tool for development work?<p class="message sent">I love using VS Code. It has fantastic extensions and customization options that make coding a breeze. What about you?<p class=message>Same here, we are on the same page. And have you tried the new Live Share option? It's like pair programming, but virtual.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I definitely need to check it out. Thanks for the tip!<p class=message>My pleasure. And hey, have you heard the latest joke about coding?<p class="message sent">No, what is it?<p class=message>Why did the programmer quit his job? He didn't get arrays.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's hilarious.<p class=message>Glad you enjoyed it. Alright, let's get back to work. We need to finish that bug fix before the end of the day.<p class="message sent">Yeah, let's do it. And then, let's celebrate the release with a cold beer!<p class=message>Sounds good to me!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e005f47b-67d8-448b-99dd-620e8d323b72.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
