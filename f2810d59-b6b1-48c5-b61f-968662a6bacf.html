What kind of music do you play?<p class=message>Mostly funk and soul, but I'm always open to experimenting with different genres.<p class="message sent">That's cool, Osaka has a pretty diverse music scene so I'm sure you'll find some inspiration here.<p class=message>I hope so! By the way, do you know of any local music festivals?<p class="message sent">Yes, there's the Osaka Jazz Festival coming up next month. I bet you'd love it since you're a jazz lover.<p class=message>Definitely! It's always fun to check out new festivals and connect with fellow musicians.<p class="message sent">Also, have you tried any local instruments? They're quite unique here in Japan.<p class=message>No, I haven't had the chance yet. Any recommendations?<p class="message sent">You should try the shamisen, a traditional three-stringed instrument. It's difficult, but once you get the hang of it, it's rewarding to play.<p class=message>Sounds like a challenge, but I'm up for it. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class="message sent">No worries! And if you need any help with navigating around the music scene in Osaka, I'm happy to help.<p class=message>That's very kind of you, thank you. It's great to have someone who knows the local scene.<p class="message sent">Of course, let's make some music together while we're at it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f280f3e8-aed3-4dfc-b04e-30611700ae5a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
