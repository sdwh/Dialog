We have some fresh saba and tako, would you like to try some?<p class=message>Actually, I'm the expert on grilling meat. Our customers can't get enough of our wagyu beef and kobe steak.<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing. I've always been more of a fish person myself.<p class=message>Well, that's what makes this such a great team. We cater to all tastes.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And at the end of the day, it's all about making our customers happy.<p class=message>Speaking of which, did you hear about the customer who only wanted to eat the rarest cuts of beef?<p class="message sent">No way. What did you do?<p class=message>We gave him a special cut and called it the "unicorn steak". It made him so happy that he came back for more.<p class="message sent">That's hilarious! I'll have to see if I can come up with something equally creative for the fish.<p class=message>Maybe you can create a dish called "mermaid sushi" or something like that.<p class="message sent">I like the way you think!<p class=message>By the way, have you tried the sake here? It pairs really well with the grilled seafood.<p class="message sent">I haven't, but I'm always up for trying something new. Why don't we grab a cup after our shift ends?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Working here can definitely take a toll on our energy levels, but it's nothing a good drink can't fix.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And with our teamwork, we can tackle anything that comes our way in this kitchen.<p class=message>Absolutely. I'm glad we make such a great team, A and B, the ultimate grilling duo!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1351ca4d-af0a-491f-8424-d0cd8dac2a38.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
