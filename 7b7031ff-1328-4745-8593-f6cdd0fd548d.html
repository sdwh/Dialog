I'm really excited to visit Osaka. Have you been there before, driver?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been there a number of times. It's a great city to explore, especially the food and the nightlife.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! I'm looking forward to trying some authentic Japanese food. Do you have any recommendations for me?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! You have to try takoyaki, which are little balls of octopus cooked in batter. They're a local specialty and very tasty.<p class=message>Oh wow, that sounds unique. I'll have to try it. Is there anything else you'd suggest?<p class="message sent">Definitely try some sushi, of course. And if you're feeling adventurous, go for fugu, which is a type of blowfish that's famous in Osaka.<p class=message>Fugu? I've heard it's quite dangerous to eat.<p class="message sent">It can be, but in the hands of a skilled chef it's perfectly safe. Just make sure to go to a reputable restaurant.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice, driver. I appreciate it. So, what's your favorite thing about Osaka?<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough question. I think it's the energy of the city. There's always something going on, whether it's a festival or a concert or just people enjoying themselves.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm really looking forward to experiencing all of that. Oh, and speaking of festivals, I heard there's a big one coming up soon?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's called the Tenjin Matsuri and it's one of the biggest festivals in Japan. It's definitely worth checking out if you're here when it's happening.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. Thanks for telling me about it. We're almost there now, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, we're just a few minutes away. Is this your first time in Osaka?<p class=message>Yes, it is. I can't wait to explore the city and see all of the sights.<p class="message sent">You're in for a treat. Osaka is a fantastic place. Have a great time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7b642e90-a4b4-4d6f-a230-3d8f52e03a85.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
