I'm excited to work with you today, B.<p class="message sent">Same here, A! What recipes are we making for today's desserts?<p class=message>I've planned on making some classic vanilla cupcakes with buttercream frosting and some apple turnovers. How about you, B?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great pairing with our coffee menu! I'm thinking of making some Ethiopian pour-over coffee and some iced lattes.<p class=message>Cool! I'll start on the cupcakes while you make the pour-over coffee.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me get the hot water and coffee grinds. By the way, have you tried any new dessert flavors lately?<p class=message>Actually, I've been experimenting with adding matcha powder to vanilla cake batter, and it turned out really delicious! It's an earthy and delightful flavor.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting! I'll definitely have to try it. Speaking of interesting things, have you heard about the new coffee trend of adding mushroom powder to coffee for added health benefits?<p class=message>Yes, I have! I'm willing to try it out but I'm a bit skeptical about the taste. Have you tried it yet, B?<p class="message sent">I have, and to my surprise, it wasn't bad at all. It had a mild mushroom flavor with a hint of earthiness.<p class=message>Hmm, maybe I'll give it a try sometime. By the way, I just finished baking the cupcakes. Do you want to help me frost them?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Let me finish the pour-over first, and I'll be right over. Thanks for working with me today, A. It's always a pleasure.<p class=message>No, thank you, B! It's always fun working with you too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=54ebb536-62ab-40a7-a23c-b84ddb37486c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
