How's everything going tonight?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thank you for asking. The customers seem to be enjoying the seafood dishes.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Speaking of seafood, did you get a chance to try the new crab cake recipe we added to the menu?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard a lot of positive feedback from the customers who've tried it. I'll have to give it a taste soon.<p class=message>Definitely worth a try. I actually caught those crabs myself on a recent fishing trip.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive! You're a man of many talents.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, running a seafood restaurant requires a love for the ocean and its creatures. Speaking of which, I saw some lobsters that came in today that are bigger than my arm!<p class="message sent">(gasps) Really? Can we take a look at them?<p class=message>Absolutely. Follow me to the kitchen, I'll show you where they're being kept.<p class="message sent">(amazed) Those are some massive lobsters! Do you think any customer would be brave enough to order one?<p class=message>(smiling) We'll have to wait and see. But I have a feeling there might be a seafood enthusiast or two who will be up for the challenge.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I love the enthusiasm. This place always keeps it interesting.<p class=message>That's what we aim for. And we couldn't do it without the hard work of our staff. Thanks for all your help, B.<p class="message sent">Of course, anytime. It's a pleasure working here.<p class=message>(smiling) And it's a pleasure having you on the team. Now, let's get back to those customers and make sure they're enjoying their meals!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0c1a658b-2517-467f-85aa-db1052e09c90.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
