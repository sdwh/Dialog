We're gonna watch the latest superhero movie that just came out. Have you seen the trailer?<p class=message>Yeah, I did! It looks really action-packed. Can't wait to see it on the big screen.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you're excited! So, how's it going with your acting career?<p class=message>It's been great, thanks for asking! I just finished filming for an indie romantic comedy.<p class="message sent">That's wonderful! I'm happy to hear that. Did you have to do any stunts for the movie?<p class=message>Oh, no no no. There were no stunts involved, just a lot of hilarious scenes and romantic dialogues.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a fun watch. Do you have any upcoming projects?<p class=message>Yup, I'm actually auditioning for a TV show this weekend. It's a drama about cops and robbers. Fingers crossed!<p class="message sent">Good luck, A! I'm sure you'll nail the audition. By the way, which superhero would you like to play in a movie?<p class=message>Hmm, that's a tough question. I think I'd like to be a superhero that can fly.<p class="message sent">Interesting choice! Would you prefer to wear a cape or no cape?<p class=message>Definitely a cape. It makes the flight more dramatic.<p class="message sent">I see your point. I would prefer to be a superhero with super strength. It would be cool to lift heavy things effortlessly.<p class=message>Yeah, that would be amazing! But you'd have to be careful not to break anything.<p class="message sent">True, true. Speaking of which, let's go grab some snacks before the movie starts. What do you feel like eating?<p class=message>I'm craving for popcorn and soda. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'll go for some nachos and a slushie. Let's hurry before the previews start!<p class=message>Alright, let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=75e4f8e6-d262-45c0-ba92-402898c02c69.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
