It's great to finally meet you in person. So, what brings us here today?<p class="message sent">Hey, A. Nice to meet you too. Our company wants to develop a new blockchain application system. I was hoping we could brainstorm some ideas together.<p class=message>Sounds exciting! But, what specific industry or sector are we targeting?<p class="message sent">We're looking into the healthcare industry. We want to create a secure platform for medical records sharing and transparent transaction management.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Well, let's start with the basics. What blockchain protocol do you want to use?<p class="message sent">We're considering using the Ethereum blockchain due to its open-source nature and smart contract capabilities.<p class=message>Good choice. But have you thought of potential security issues?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's why we're planning to use various security measures such as encryption, multiple authentication layers, and regular auditing.<p class=message>Nice. And what about scalability?<p class="message sent">We'll use sharding to distribute the workload across multiple nodes efficiently.<p class=message>Sounds promising. Hey, have you heard about that blockchain-based wine trading platform that was recently launched?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did. How cool is it that they can verify the wine's authenticity and provenance through the blockchain?<p class=message>Really cool! Maybe we can consider implementing something similar for tracking medical supplies.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We could use RFID technology for tracking and integrate it with our blockchain platform.<p class=message>Excellent. I can't wait to start working on this project together. Let's schedule a meeting with the rest of the team and hash out the details further.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's going to be an exciting challenge.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=325519e2-4784-44e0-99a1-62f47db2424e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
