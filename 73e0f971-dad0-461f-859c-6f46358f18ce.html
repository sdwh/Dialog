I'm excited to explore this fish market in Nagasaki. I've heard it's one of the best in Japan.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! And as a guide, I'm here to make sure you're getting the best and freshest ingredients for your cooking.<p class=message>Perfect! I'm planning on making a traditional Japanese dish for my restaurant back home.<p class="message sent">That's great! What dish are you planning to make?<p class=message>I'm thinking of making tempura. I've learned the basics, but I want to learn more about the local ingredients and techniques.<p class="message sent">Tempura is a great choice! Let's start by looking for the freshest seafood and vegetables for your dish.<p class=message>Sounds good. I see some large prawns over there. They look fresh and delicious.<p class="message sent">Yes, those are called "amaebi" in Japanese. They're sweet and perfect for tempura.<p class=message>Wonderful! And what about these green beans? They're so thin and tender.<p class="message sent">Those are called "chasoba". They're a type of green tea leaf that's used for cooking. They're perfect for tempura too!<p class=message>This is so exciting! Now let's move on to the cooking techniques.<p class="message sent">Sure. The key to making good tempura is in the batter. It should be light and crispy.<p class=message>I see. What about the oil? Which oil is best for frying tempura?<p class="message sent">In Nagasaki, we use sesame oil, but you can also use vegetable oil.<p class=message>Hmm, sesame oil sounds interesting. I'll give that a try in my restaurant.<p class="message sent">Great! And don't forget to serve the tempura with tentsuyu sauce.<p class=message>Of course! I'll make sure to make the sauce from scratch. Thank you for your help today, B. I've learned so much.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. I'm happy to share the local knowledge and culture with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=73dacab2-cb6e-4618-877a-58c3b3f57cc0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
