How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hi, Tutor A! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I'm excited for today's lesson.<p class=message>That's great to hear, B. Speaking of which, I wanted to ask how you feel about our progress in the course so far?<p class="message sent">Honestly, Tutor A, I'm really enjoying the pace we're going at. It's challenging but manageable.<p class=message>That's wonderful to hear! Are there any particular areas of the course material you're struggling with or want to focus more on?<p class="message sent">Well, I've been struggling a bit with phrasal verbs, but I think with a bit more practice I'll get the hang of it.<p class=message>Phrasal verbs can definitely be tricky! Let's make sure to focus on that more in future lessons. Have you found any of the previous lessons particularly helpful?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I found the lesson on idioms to be really useful in everyday conversations, and the grammar review was a great refresher.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that, B. Speaking of idioms, do you have a favorite one to use?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. I like using "kill two birds with one stone" when I have to do two things at once.<p class=message>That's a great one! Do you have any other favorite English expressions or sayings?<p class="message sent">I think "break a leg" is pretty funny when you want to wish someone good luck.<p class=message>Haha, yes, it is a bit strange when you think about it. Well, B, our time is almost up for today's lesson. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?<p class="message sent">No, not at the moment, Tutor A. Thanks for another great lesson!<p class=message>You're welcome, B. See you next time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d2d743f0-d700-45ff-8bd9-9a3dd77e5925.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
