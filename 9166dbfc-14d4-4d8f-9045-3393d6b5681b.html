I love talking about food, do you have any favorite dishes or restaurants to recommend?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I love indulging in Asian cuisine, especially ramen and sushi. Have you ever tried making ramen from scratch?<p class=message>No, I haven't, but that sounds amazing. Do you have a recipe you could share?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I use homemade chicken broth, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and of course, ramen noodles. It's easy to make and tastes bomb.<p class=message>Yum, I'm drooling already. By the way, have you ever tried Korean BBQ? There's a great spot downtown where you can grill your meat right at your table.<p class="message sent">No way! That sounds like an amazing experience. How is it different from regular BBQ?<p class=message>Well, instead of being pre-cooked and served to you, you choose your own meat and then cook it yourself over a small grill on your table. Plus, you get to try all sorts of traditional Korean side dishes.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, I definitely need to try that. Speaking of trying new foods, have you ever had Ethiopian food before? There's a spot a few blocks away that serves the best injera bread and spicy stews.<p class=message>No, I haven't, but that sounds intriguing. What is injera bread?<p class="message sent">It's a sourdough-risen flatbread that's slightly spongy and with a unique taste. You use it to scoop up the stews and curries that come with the meal. Trust me, you'll love it.<p class=message>I'm convinced, we need to check that place out. But before we go, have you ever made your own sushi before?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. It's a lot easier than you'd think, you just need sushi rice, nori sheets, and your choice of fillings. Then you roll it up and slice it into perfect bite-sized pieces.<p class=message>I'm impressed. Do you have a favorite filling combination?<p class="message sent">I love using crab meat, avocado, and cucumber. It's a classic that never disappoints.<p class=message>Sounds delicious, I'll have to try that at home sometime. Thanks for all the food inspiration, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to share my love for food with you. Let's make some plans to try out that Korean BBQ spot soon.<p class=message>Absolutely, I can't wait. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=915f20f1-5224-4078-873c-3f9804d6c212.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
