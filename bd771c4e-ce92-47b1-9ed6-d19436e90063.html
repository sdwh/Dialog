Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, A. I'm the restaurant manager. Glad to have you here.<p class=message>I'm excited to check out the dessert plates and decor today. Have you made any changes lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, we just added a new mural on the wall. It's very colorful and playful.<p class=message>That sounds promising. I hope it complements our desserts well.<p class="message sent">I'm sure it will. By the way, how did you become a pastry chef in West Point?<p class=message>I graduated from the Culinary Institute of America and served in the army. Then, I joined West Point as a culinary instructor.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. I'm sure your students loved your classes.<p class=message>The cadets are very disciplined and demanding, so it's challenging but rewarding to teach them.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. Speaking of discipline, I heard that West Point has a tough physical fitness program.<p class=message>Yes, that's true. We have to stay in shape because we might be deployed to combat zones.<p class="message sent">Wow, that must be intense. Do you have any tips for staying fit and healthy?<p class=message>Eat well, sleep well, and exercise regularly. And of course, moderation is key when it comes to desserts.<p class="message sent">Ha! Good advice. But how can anyone resist a perfectly crafted dessert plate like this?<p class=message>Agreed. I'm glad our efforts in the kitchen and the dining room are paying off. Thanks for having me here today, B.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure, A. Let's keep making sweet memories together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bd76362a-dc8a-4bdf-9656-10a43034cf59.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
