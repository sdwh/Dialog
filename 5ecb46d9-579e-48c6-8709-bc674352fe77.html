Would it be possible to request for some extra snacks? I'm feeling quite famished.<p class="message sent">Of course, sir! I'll see what I can do for you. Our snacks are quite popular, so I hope you'll enjoy them.<p class=message>Thank you so much! I appreciate it. I'm a bit of a foodie, so I always look forward to trying new things.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear, sir! We have a wide variety of snacks available, from your classic potato chips to more exotic options like wasabi peas.<p class=message>Hmm, I think I'll go for the wasabi peas. I've never tried those before.<p class="message sent">Excellent choice, sir! They're definitely a bit spicy, so make sure you have a drink handy.<p class=message>Ha, will do! I always welcome a bit of a challenge when it comes to spicy food.<p class="message sent">Well, I hope you're up for it, sir. Our wasabi peas are definitely not for the faint of heart.<p class=message>I'll take my chances! Oh, and while you're here, would you happen to have any recommendations for other snacks or the like?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Have you tried our cheese and crackers? They're quite popular among our passengers.<p class=message>Ooh, sounds like a tasty combo. I'll definitely give those a try as well.<p class="message sent">Great, sir! I'll bring those out to you shortly. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help and recommendations, miss.<p class="message sent">It's been my pleasure, sir. Enjoy your snacks and have a pleasant flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ec85640-a062-408f-9765-85d22690a7cb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
