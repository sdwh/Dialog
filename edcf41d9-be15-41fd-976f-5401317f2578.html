How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. It was relaxing. I caught up on some much-needed sleep. How about you?<p class=message>It was good. I went to a comedy show with some friends. Have you been to any good shows recently?<p class="message sent">Not really. I've been too busy with work to enjoy any entertainment.<p class=message>Speaking of work, have you finished the report I assigned you?<p class="message sent">Almost. I just need to do some final proofreading.<p class=message>Great! I appreciate your hard work. By the way, have you had any interesting ideas for the upcoming project presentation?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. I was thinking of incorporating some humor into the presentation to keep things fun and engaging.<p class=message>I like that idea. Humor is always good to break the ice. Do you want to give it a try during our meeting tomorrow?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'd love to. By the way, have you seen that funny video going around on social media about office etiquette?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Can you send me the link?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll email it to you right now.<p class=message>Thanks. Speaking of office etiquette, I noticed that some of the printers are out of paper. Can you take care of that?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'll restock them right away.<p class=message>Thanks, B. You're a great help. Let me know if you need any assistance with anything else.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=edccaa08-a540-429d-aa13-540c6b07f615.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
