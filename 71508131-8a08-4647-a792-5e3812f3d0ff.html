So, what's the buzz today?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I brought my notebook for us to discuss the publishing plan. I believe we need to set some deadlines for the next steps.<p class=message>Yes, that's a good idea. How about we work backwards from the release date and allocate enough time for editing, proofreading, and design?<p class="message sent">Sounds reasonable. By the way, have you thought about the book cover design?<p class=message>I have some ideas in mind, but I'm open to suggestions. Maybe we could try a simple yet eye-catching design?<p class="message sent">That sounds good, let's make sure it suits the book's theme. Also, have you decided on a title yet?<p class=message>Not yet, I'm contemplating between two options, which do you think sounds better: "The Secret Life of Cats" or "Whisker Wonders"?<p class="message sent">"Whisker Wonders" has a nice ring to it! But make sure the content will live up to the title. And speaking of content, have you finished the last chapter?<p class=message>Almost there, just a few finishing touches. How about you, have you found any glaring errors in the draft manuscript?<p class="message sent">Nothing too alarming, just a few inconsistencies we need to clarify. By the way, I received some preliminary feedback from potential readers, they're excited about your book!<p class=message>That's great to hear! I hope it will exceed their expectations. How about we celebrate the book release with a book signing event?<p class="message sent">Sure, we can schedule that with the bookstore. And hey, don't forget to practice your autograph!<p class=message>Haha, thanks for the reminder B. I'm looking forward to becoming a famous author!<p class="message sent">With this book, you definitely have a chance. Let's make it a bestseller!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=714eb9c2-bd11-47f6-b918-8fbc92d79d2e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
