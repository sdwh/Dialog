I am glad to see you all here.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having us, we are excited to learn new poses today.<p class=message>Great, today let's focus on our flexibility. We will start with some warm-up stretches.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. I have been sitting at a desk all day so I definitely need to stretch.<p class=message>It's very important to stretch your body after sitting for long periods of time. Okay, let's start with some simple stretches like touching our toes and reaching up to the sky.<p class="message sent">These feel good already. I can feel my body starting to loosen up.<p class=message>That's great, keep breathing and feeling the stretch. Now let's move to some more challenging poses like the downward dog.<p class="message sent">Oh, I have seen that one before but have never tried it. Can you show me how to do it?<p class=message>Sure, let me demonstrate it first. You start on all fours, then lift your hips up and back, pushing your heels down towards the floor.<p class="message sent">Wow, that looks hard. Let me give it a try.<p class=message>You're doing great! Remember to breathe and lengthen your spine as you hold the pose.<p class="message sent">This is definitely a challenge, but I can feel my body getting stronger.<p class=message>That's the spirit! You are doing a great job. Keep up the good work and let's move on to the next pose.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'm excited to learn more.<p class=message>Alright class, let's finish up with some relaxation poses to wind down. Thank you all for coming today and I hope to see you again soon.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for the class, I feel amazing! See you next time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d4ec45aa-732f-4ec1-9093-e9d9f3ee8e30.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
