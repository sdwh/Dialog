How's business today?"<p class="message sent">"Good morning! It's been quite busy since we started serving breakfast."<p class=message>"That's great to hear. I've brought some new blends of tea that I think would go really well with your delicious sticky rice cakes."<p class="message sent">"Oh, that would be perfect! What kind of tea do you have?"<p class=message>"I brought a jasmine green tea and a black tea infused with ginger and lemongrass. They're both very fragrant and flavorful."<p class="message sent">"I'm excited to try them out with our rice cakes. We have mango, coconut, and red bean fillings today. Which one do you want to try first?"<p class=message>"I think I'll start with the mango. It's one of my favorites."<p class="message sent">"Great choice! Here you go, and let me brew you a cup of that jasmine green tea."<p class=message>"Mmm, this is really good. The sweetness of the mango complements the floral notes of the tea."<p class="message sent">"I'm glad you like it. You know, I was thinking of adding some savory rice cakes to our menu as well. What do you think?"<p class=message>"That's a great idea. Maybe a rice cake with some minced pork and Chinese sausage filling would be really tasty."<p class="message sent">"Yes, and we could also try a vegetarian option with some shiitake mushrooms and black fungus. Or maybe even a spicy chicken and basil filling for those who like it hot."<p class=message>"Those all sound really appetizing. I can't wait to collaborate on some new flavors and see how they pair with our tea."<p class="message sent">"Agreed! It's always exciting to try out new things and see what our customers enjoy."<p class=message>"Well, I better get going now. I have another appointment this afternoon. See you again soon!"<p class="message sent">"Take care, and thank you for stopping by. Safe travels!"</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=936a92de-d952-4a3e-957e-4cb52d71dc84.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
