Hmm, I'm not too sure. What are they?<p class=message>Oh they're just heaven in a bite! They're basically twice-fried slices of plantain, and they're so delicious.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting! Where did you try them?<p class=message>I had them at a local Colombian restaurant in town. They served it with guacamole and some cheese on top, and it was so good!<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm curious now. Are they like regular chips?<p class=message>Not really. They're thicker and crunchier, and they have a slightly sweet taste because they're made from plantains.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. So are they a snack or a meal?<p class=message>They can be a snack or a side dish, and they're perfect for sharing with friends or family.<p class="message sent">That's cool! I love sharing food with others. Do you have any recommendations on where to get Patacones?<p class=message>Yes! There's a food truck that serves them near the park. They have different toppings like shrimp, beef, or chicken, and you can even make your own combination.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing! I can't wait to try it for myself. Thanks for the recommendation, A!<p class=message>No problem, B! I'm always happy to share my favorite food finds with others.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=649d29bf-4d39-4118-81d5-07c59dff6439.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
