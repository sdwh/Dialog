Can you recommend any books that will capture the attention of 6th graders?<p class=message>Of course, we have a great selection of books for that age group. Have you heard of the "Percy Jackson" series? It's a popular series about Greek mythology that kids love.<p class="message sent">Yes, I have heard of it. What else do you recommend?<p class=message>Another great choice is "The Maze Runner" series, it's science-fiction and has a great amount of action and adventure.<p class="message sent">Those sound perfect, thank you. What about some classics for my class to read?<p class=message>For a classic, I would recommend "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee. It is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel and deals with important themes such as justice and prejudice.<p class="message sent">That's a great suggestion, thank you. Do you have any other recommendations for me?<p class=message>"The Chronicles of Narnia" by C.S. Lewis is a timeless classic that appeals to both children and adults. It is a magical adventure through a world full of wonder.<p class="message sent">That sounds great, my students will love it. Thank you so much for all of your help.<p class=message>You're welcome. If you need any more help, don't hesitate to ask. Enjoy the books!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=35f9b7f5-8bbb-4096-b84d-131d533c6db8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
