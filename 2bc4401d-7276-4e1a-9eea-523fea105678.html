I hear you're a teacher. How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, I am. It's been challenging lately trying to adjust to the new normal of online or hybrid classes.<p class=message>That's understandable. Have you considered using any education technology to help you out?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I'm familiar with a few programs, but I'm not sure how to use them effectively.<p class=message>Well, I'm a tech expert, so maybe I can help you out. What are you using right now?<p class="message sent">Well, I use Google Classroom a lot, but I feel like I could be utilizing some of its features more efficiently.<p class=message>You definitely could be! Have you tried using the Google Classroom add-ons?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What are they?<p class=message>They're additional features that integrate with Google Classroom to make things easier for teachers. There are several really helpful ones, like Kami for annotating PDFs and Quizizz for creating online quizzes.<p class="message sent">That sounds really helpful! I'll have to check those out.<p class=message>Another tool you might find useful is Screencastify. It's a screen recording tool that can be really helpful for explaining concepts or going through a presentation.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's interesting! I've always struggled with explaining things just through text on a website or in a video call.<p class=message>Yeah, it's definitely a game changer. There are so many edtech tools out there that can make teaching a lot easier and more effective.<p class="message sent">I'm glad I talked to you! I'm definitely going to start exploring some of these options.<p class=message>Awesome! It's always great to see teachers embracing technology to enhance their teaching. Let me know if you have any other questions.<p class="message sent">Thanks so much! Will do.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2bc0ed9b-ac13-4262-b60f-bf36e6bbc4c7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
