Have you had a chance to look at the UI mockups I sent over?<p class="message sent">Hey! Just took a look at them - they look great. I can definitely work with that in the back end.<p class=message>Awesome, glad to hear that! Anything that stands out as particularly challenging?<p class="message sent">Well, I noticed that some of the elements don't match our current data structures - we might need to do some tweaking there.<p class=message>No problem, we can adjust the mockups if needed. Speaking of data structures, how has your database design been going?<p class="message sent">It's been going well. I've added a table for employee information and created some relationships with the other tables we'll need.<p class=message>Nice job! I'm working on implementing some animation effects to enhance user experience. Do you have any recommendations for how to optimize loading times?<p class="message sent">Hmm, we might be able to look into lazy loading some components or optimizing our queries. I can take a closer look and get back to you on that.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. By the way, did you hear about the office pool tournament happening this weekend?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been practicing my shots all week! Have you entered yet?<p class=message>I haven't, but I might give it a shot. Who knows, maybe I'll be the next pool shark at the office.<p class="message sent">Haha, we'll have to see about that. Good luck if you do decide to join in!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ff6c7fd3-1141-47b7-8f97-dcd74ee625c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
