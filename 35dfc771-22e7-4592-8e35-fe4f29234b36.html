My name is A. What's yours?<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you, A. My name is B. Thanks for your help. How long have you been working as a cargo loader?<p class=message>I have been an assistant for about five years. I've created a system that makes cargo handling efficient.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's nice to hear! Maybe you can give me some tips on how to handle a smooth takeoff.<p class=message>Sure thing. Do you need help securing the cargo?<p class="message sent">That would be great. I'm not too familiar with some of the bulky ones here.<p class=message>Not to worry, we'll make quick work of it. Say, do you have any interesting flying stories?<p class="message sent">Oh, plenty! Like the time we had a sudden turbulence and I accidentally spilled my drink on a passenger!<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious! How did they react?<p class="message sent">Surprisingly, the passenger laughed it off and said they needed to cool down anyway. What about you, any interesting work stories?<p class=message>Well, I once had to carry a shipment of live chickens. Imagine the squawking the whole flight!<p class="message sent">(laughs) That must have been quite a memorable trip! Have you ever traveled internationally?<p class=message>Yes, I went to Japan with my family last year. It was amazing! I tried all the local food and visited some of the shrines.<p class="message sent">Japan is definitely one of my favorite places to fly to. The culture, the food, and the people are just amazing.<p class=message>That's true. I hope I get to go back again soon. By the way, are we almost done loading the cargo?<p class="message sent">Yes, I think we are. Thank you so much for your help, A. You're a valuable asset to the team!<p class=message>Thank you, B. It was great working with you. Have a safe flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=35dc4683-a889-47a2-ac95-6b1336ee76b8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
