Just know that we are in this together, and I will do my best to make this as smooth as possible for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate it.<p class=message>No need to thank me, it is all part of my job. By the way, have you thought of any jokes we can tell during the surgery to lighten the mood?<p class="message sent">(chuckles) Not really, maybe you can tell me one?<p class=message>Okay, why did the tomato turn red?<p class="message sent">I don't know, why?<p class=message>Because it saw the salad dressing! (laughs)<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's a good one, doctor! Alright, now I am definitely less nervous.<p class=message>Glad to be of service! Now, let's get started on the surgery. Just try to relax and breathe deeply.<p class="message sent">Okay, I will do my best.<p class=message>(during the surgery) You're doing great, patient B. This won't take too long.<p class="message sent">(in a groggy voice) Thank you, doctor. I trust in your skills.<p class=message>(once the surgery is done) Alright, we're all finished. How do you feel?<p class="message sent">(smiling) Surprisingly good, doctor. Thank you so much for your expertise and your humor.<p class=message>(smiling back) And thank you for being a great patient. Rest well and I'll see you on the next check-up.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bd361790-7ee4-4d06-8a77-0f3a48db10e7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
