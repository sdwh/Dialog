Welcome to yoga. Let's start by finding a comfortable seated position on our mats.<p class="message sent">Good morning, teacher! I'm excited to be here. I've always wanted to try yoga.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Just remember to listen to your body and do what feels good for you. Are you ready to begin?<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it!<p class=message>Alright, let's start with some deep belly breaths. Inhale through your nose, filling your belly with air, and exhale through your mouth.<p class="message sent">(exhales) Wow, I already feel more relaxed.<p class=message>That's the power of breathing. Now let's move into some gentle stretches. Reach your arms up towards the ceiling and interlace your fingers.<p class="message sent">Like this?<p class=message>Yes, exactly. Now lean to the right and take a deep breath.<p class="message sent">(inhales) This feels amazing. I can really feel it stretching my side.<p class=message>Great job. Now let's switch to the other side. Keep breathing deeply and let your body relax into the stretch.<p class="message sent">(exhales) This is harder than I thought, but it feels so good.<p class=message>That's the beauty of yoga. It challenges us while also helping us to relax and let go. Now let's move into some standing poses.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'm ready.<p class=message>Let's start with mountain pose. Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart and your arms at your sides.<p class="message sent">Like this?<p class=message>Yes, perfect. Now imagine a string pulling the top of your head towards the ceiling, lengthening your spine. Take a deep breath in.<p class="message sent">(inhales) I feel so grounded.<p class=message>That's it. Now let's move into a forward fold. Bend at the hips and let your head and neck relax.<p class="message sent">(exhales) This is so relieving on my lower back.<p class=message>It's one of my favorite poses for that reason. And now let's come back up and finish with some relaxation poses.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me.<p class=message>Let's start with corpse pose. Lie flat on your back with your arms at your sides, palms facing up.<p class="message sent">(settles into position) This is so comfortable.<p class=message>Yes, just let your body relax and your mind follow. Now focus on your breath and let go of any tension or stress.<p class="message sent">(breathes deeply) This is exactly what I needed. Thank you, teacher.<p class=message>You're welcome, student. Namaste.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=91fd7cab-dd86-470c-b5c2-8531c4a0e8d0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
