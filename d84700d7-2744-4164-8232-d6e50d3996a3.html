But do we really need a new one? I mean, what can it do that the current one can't already?<p class=message>Well, for starters, the camera is supposed to be even better, and the battery life longer.<p class="message sent">Hmm, those do sound like good points. But what about the price? Can we really justify spending so much money on a phone?<p class=message>I see your point, but think of all the things we can do with it. It's not just a phone, it's practically a mini computer.<p class="message sent">I guess you're right. Speaking of computers, have you heard about the new advancements in artificial intelligence?<p class=message>Yeah, I saw something about it on the news. It's a bit scary, though, don't you think? Like, what if they become smarter than us and try to take over the world?<p class="message sent">Haha, I highly doubt that will happen. But I do think it's interesting to see how far technology has come. Imagine what our grandparents would think of all this.<p class=message>Yeah, it's crazy to think about. Hey, have you tried using virtual reality yet?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. I heard it's really cool, though. Have you tried it?<p class=message>Yeah, I did at a friend's house. It was insane! I felt like I was actually in a different world.<p class="message sent">Wow, that does sound pretty cool. I'll have to try it out sometime.<p class=message>Definitely. And speaking of trying things out, have you heard about the new self-driving cars?<p class="message sent">Yes, and honestly, the idea kind of scares me. I don't know if I could trust a car to drive me around without any human control.<p class=message>Yeah, I can understand that. But think about all the time it would save us if we didn't have to waste it driving. We could be so much more productive.<p class="message sent">I suppose you have a valid point. I'm still not sure I'm sold on the idea, though.<p class=message>That's okay, it's always good to have different opinions. But one thing we can both agree on is that technology is definitely advancing faster than we ever could have imagined.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I wonder what advancements will come next. Maybe we'll even have flying cars one day!<p class=message>Haha, who knows? It's always exciting to think about the possibilities.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d8410def-87bf-44d7-b9e4-47cf28fb9ae2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
