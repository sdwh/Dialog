How's the chicken coming along?<p class="message sent">Great, just finished up a batch of fresh wings. They're ready to fry now.<p class=message>Perfect timing. We have a group of hungry customers coming in any minute now.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. I'll start frying them up right away.<p class=message>Hey, have you ever tried using different spices in the batter? Maybe we could experiment and come up with a new flavor.<p class="message sent">Actually, I have been playing around with some new spice blends lately. Want me to whip up a small batch for us to sample?<p class=message>Yes, please do! I'm always looking for ways to improve our menu and keep things interesting.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I love getting creative in the kitchen.<p class=message>Speaking of creativity, have you ever considered adding some vegetarian options to our menu?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I haven't thought about that yet. But with so many people becoming health-conscious, it might be a good idea.<p class=message>That's what I was thinking too. How about we try making some battered and fried veggies as a starter?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! We could use zucchini, mushrooms, or even sweet potato.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. Let's give it a shot and see how it turns out.<p class="message sent">For sure. It'll be fun and challenging to come up with new and exciting dishes for our customers.<p class=message>Absolutely. And with your skills in the kitchen and my business savvy, I think we make a pretty great team.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's keep surprising and delighting our customers with mouth-watering dishes!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=efc94f29-9a28-4def-90b4-45a6d05ecbf3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
