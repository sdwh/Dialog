Coming right up! That's a lovely choice, by the way. I always find the combination of a citrusy tart and a robust cappuccino to be perfect!<p class=message>Thanks! As a pastry chef, it's always nice to hear that! Speaking of, your latte art is amazing! How do you make it look so perfect?<p class="message sent">Thank you! It just comes down to practice and patience. I'm sure the same applies to your baking skills!<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Did you have to go through any special training to get your skills?<p class="message sent">Yes, I actually did a barista course where I learned about the different types of coffee beans and the proper techniques for making a great cup of coffee.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds interesting. As a pastry chef, I also did some training to improve my baking skills. Did you learn to make any desserts during your course?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! We learned how to make a simple tiramisu, which was quite delicious.<p class=message>That sounds great! I'll have to try that sometime. Speaking of desserts, here's your lemon tart. It looks amazing!<p class="message sent">Thank you! And here's your cappuccino with a heart on top. Enjoy!<p class=message>This lemon tart is delicious! How do you manage to make it so perfectly tangy and sweet?<p class="message sent">Our pastry chef team uses a combination of fresh lemon juice and sugar to get the perfect balance of flavors. It's one of our most popular desserts.<p class=message>I can definitely see why! I'm going to have to come back again and again just to try all of your other desserts.<p class="message sent">We'll be happy to have you! And don't forget to try some of our signature coffees too.<p class=message>I definitely won't! It was great talking with you, thank you for the delicious coffee and perfect tart.<p class="message sent">Likewise, thank you for the compliment and hope you have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ae010156-d012-44da-954a-7371b6bc53c0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
