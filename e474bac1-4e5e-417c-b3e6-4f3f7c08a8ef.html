Because light attracts bugs!"<p class="message sent">Hahaha, that's a good one! Speaking of bugs, have you found any bugs in our current project?<p class=message>Yeah, I found a few, but I was able to squash them pretty quickly. Gotta love the power of Ruby on Rails!<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I find Ruby on Rails to be so intuitive and easy to work with. Plus, it saves us a ton of time compared to other frameworks.<p class=message>Totally agree. And can we talk about how great it is to work on a team with other developers who are just as passionate about coding as we are?<p class="message sent">Yes! It's amazing to bounce ideas off of each other and collaborate on projects. It makes the work a lot more enjoyable.<p class=message>Definitely. And it's amazing to see how our code can make a real impact in the world.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Technology has come so far, and we have the power to create really innovative and helpful solutions.<p class=message>Speaking of solutions, have you thought about any new features we could add to our current project?<p class="message sent">I actually have a few ideas in mind. Let's grab a coffee and discuss them further.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! But first, let's make sure our code is running smoothly before we take a break.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Nothing like a cup of coffee to energize us and help us code even better.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e4719167-2405-4e33-88c2-c77abb2c47e3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
