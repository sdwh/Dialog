How's everything going?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Everything's going great. Just had my coffee and ready to tackle the day.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I was wondering if I could get your input on something. We've been seeing a decline in sales for our latest product line. Any thoughts on why that might be?<p class="message sent">Hmm, have we checked the competition's pricing? Maybe they have a similar product at a lower price point.<p class=message>That's a good point. I'll look into that. On a lighter note, have you seen that new show on Netflix everyone's talking about?<p class="message sent">You mean 'Tiger King'? Yes, it's insane! I can't believe people actually live like that.<p class=message>I know, right! I don't think I've ever been so invested in a show before.<p class="message sent">It's definitely a guilty pleasure. But, back to business. Have we thought about promoting our product through social media influencers?<p class=message>That's a great idea, B. Let's make that happen. And thank you again for your input. It's always appreciated.<p class="message sent">Of course, anytime. And let's be sure to talk about 'Tiger King' more after work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dcd8fc69-1a19-4713-a9fe-038177efa50b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
