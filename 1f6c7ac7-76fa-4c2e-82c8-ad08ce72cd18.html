I'm A and I'm a writer. Nice to meet you, B!<p class="message sent">Hi! Nice to meet you too, A. So tell me a bit about what you're writing.<p class=message>Well, I'm working on a novel about a group of friends who go on an adventure to find a treasure in the jungle.<p class="message sent">That sounds exciting! What kind of audience are you targeting?<p class=message>I want to aim for young adults, but I'm hoping it'll appeal to anyone who likes a good adventure story.<p class="message sent">Great! Have you thought about any themes or messages you want to convey in your story?<p class=message>Yeah, I want to touch on the importance of friendship, perseverance, and the idea that sometimes the journey is more important than the destination.<p class="message sent">Those are great themes to explore. How's the writing process going so far?<p class=message>It's been a bit of a rollercoaster, to be honest. Sometimes I'll have a burst of inspiration and write for hours, and other times I'll stare at the screen for hours without writing a single word.<p class="message sent">I think that's common for writers. But don't worry, just keep pushing through and you'll get there.<p class=message>Thanks for the encouragement, B. How about you? What kind of work do you do as an editor?<p class="message sent">I mostly work with non-fiction books, helping authors make their writing more clear and concise. It's a bit different from your work, but I still love reading and helping people get their ideas across.<p class=message>That's really cool! I think we could learn a lot from each other.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Hey, do you want to grab another cup of coffee and keep chatting about our work?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds great. Thanks for meeting with me, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f5bb09b-b7de-4d72-9c2c-3a0b88b9d1cd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
