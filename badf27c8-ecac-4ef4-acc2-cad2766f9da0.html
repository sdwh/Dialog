I’ve noticed that our current express mail company isn’t meeting our needs.<p class="message sent">Yes, I agree. We’ve been having a lot of issues with delayed deliveries and lost packages.<p class=message>That’s not good. I think we need to start looking into a different provider. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Actually, I’ve been doing some research and I found a company that has a great reputation for fast and reliable service.<p class=message>That’s great. What’s the name of the company?<p class="message sent">It’s called Speedy Express. They offer same-day delivery and even have a tracking system so we can see where our packages are at all times.<p class=message>Sounds promising. Let's schedule a meeting with the representative of Speedy Express here in our office someday next week.<p class="message sent">Will do, A. And let’s make sure to ask them about their pricing options to see if they're within our budget.<p class=message>Definitely. I want to make sure we’re getting the best service for our money.<p class="message sent">I agree. And also, Speedy Express has a cute cartoon kangaroo as its mascot, which is a plus!<p class=message>Wow, a kangaroo mascot? That's unique. Maybe we could even have a little statue of it in our office.<p class="message sent">That would be a fun addition to the decor. And it could remind us of the speedy and efficient service we’ll be receiving with Speedy Express.<p class=message>I like your positive attitude, B. Let’s move forward with setting up that meeting and see if Speedy Express is the right choice for us.<p class="message sent">Will do, A. Let's hope having a new express mail service will help us ship out our products faster and make our customers happier!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=badda4d9-c9b6-4196-9a9c-2e960bcc585d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
