This is a very special place.<p class=message>Yes, I've heard that it's one of the most famous temples in Kyoto. What makes it so special?<p class="message sent">Well, the temple dates back to 798 and it's famous for its wooden terrace that juts out over the hillside. Visitors come from all over to take in the stunning view and the temple's beautiful architecture.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I can't wait to see it for myself.<p class="message sent">You'll love it. And don't forget to taste the water from the Otowa waterfall. It's said to have healing powers.<p class=message>Really? That's fascinating. I'll make sure to try it.<p class="message sent">Before we go up to the temple, let me show you some of the souvenir shops and restaurants on the way.<p class=message>Great idea. It's always interesting to see what kind of local goods are available.<p class="message sent">There are plenty of items to select from, such as sweets and crafts made from Kyoto's traditional kimono fabric.<p class=message>Wow, I'll definitely have to take some of these home with me.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And when you go up to the temple, make sure to try the fortune-telling omikuji.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard about those. I'm curious to see what my fortune will be.<p class="message sent">Yes, they're always popular with tourists. And after you finish your omikuji, make sure to tie it onto the branches of a nearby tree for good luck.<p class=message>I'll remember that. Thanks for showing me around and sharing all these neat discoveries with me.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. I hope you enjoy your time at Kiyomizu-dera.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c394dfe7-bc71-4aec-89a5-799c5d41131d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
