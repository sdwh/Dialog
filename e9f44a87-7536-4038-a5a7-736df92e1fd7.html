How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">I'm feeling fine, thank you for asking. Can I know why I am here?<p class=message>Well, we received reports of a stolen bike near your area, and we found a similar bike in your possession.<p class="message sent">Oh, that is just my own bike. I have the receipt to prove it.<p class=message>That's great. Can I see the receipt?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Let me just look for it in my bag.<p class=message>While we wait for that, mind if I ask what you do for a living?<p class="message sent">I'm actually a bike courier. I deliver parcels around the city.<p class=message>That's interesting. Do you enjoy your job?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's quite enjoyable. I get to explore the city and meet different people.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, how long have you been a bike courier?<p class="message sent">About three years now.<p class=message>Wow, that's a long time. Have you ever encountered any dangerous situations while on the job?<p class="message sent">Well, there was this one time I had to deliver a package to a construction site, and I accidentally drove into a pile of sand. It was quite embarrassing.<p class=message>Hahaha, that's quite amusing. Thank you for sharing that.<p class="message sent">No problem. Here's the receipt you asked for.<p class=message>Thank you, B. It seems like everything checks out. You're free to go. Have a nice day.<p class="message sent">Thank you, officer. You too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e9f00a5b-4f1f-4613-88a8-ec6c6a558015.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
