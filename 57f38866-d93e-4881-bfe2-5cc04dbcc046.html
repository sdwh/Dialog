What brings you to the lab today?<p class=message>We're working on developing an AI diagnostic system for our medical tech company. What do you think about that?<p class="message sent">That's really interesting. What type of data are you using for training the model?<p class=message>We're compiling data from various sources, including hospitals and research centers. What kind of challenges do you think we'll face developing this technology?<p class="message sent">One of the main challenges will be developing a system that can diagnose patients accurately without a human doctor's oversight. Also, there's the issue of data availability and quality.<p class=message>That makes sense. What kind of algorithms do you think we should be using?<p class="message sent">I think we should start with decision trees and work our way up from there. They provide a good foundation for building more complex models.<p class=message>Great idea! Do you think there's a market for this kind of technology?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! With the shortage of doctors in many places around the world, this technology could revolutionize the healthcare industry.<p class=message>That's exciting to hear. But what about the ethical considerations of relying on AI instead of human physicians?<p class="message sent">It's a valid concern, but as long as the AI is constantly monitored and reviewed by human physicians, it should be safe to use.<p class=message>That's a good point. Well, it's been great chatting with you, B. I'll see you later.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. Catch you later!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=57f16922-918b-4c63-82de-e57c4a1bac62.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
