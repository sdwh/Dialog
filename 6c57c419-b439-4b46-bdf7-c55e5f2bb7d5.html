Are you guys offering beer tastings today?<p class=message>Absolutely! We're happy to share some of our best brews with you.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. What kind of beers do you have?<p class=message>We have a variety of traditional Bavarian beers, including lagers, pilsners and dark beers.
