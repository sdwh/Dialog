How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I’m doing great, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I’m doing well too. Are you ready to start making some delicious drinks?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What’s popular these days?<p class=message>Bubble tea is still very popular, but we have some new flavors too. Have you tried our mango smoothie?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I’d love to. Can you show me how to make it?<p class=message>Sure thing. First, we’ll need some fresh mangoes, ice, milk, and sugar. Let’s get started!<p class="message sent">That sounds easy enough. What’s next?<p class=message>We blend all the ingredients together until the texture is smooth and creamy. Then, we pour it into a cup and add some tapioca pearls on top.<p class="message sent">I can’t wait to try it! Do customers like to customize their drinks?<p class=message>Yes, they do. Some people like to add extra toppings like fruit jelly or pudding, and some like to adjust the sweetness level.<p class="message sent">It’s fun to see everyone’s unique preferences. Speaking of which, have you tried the new matcha latte flavor?<p class=message>I have, and it’s delicious. Would you like to try it too?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I’ll have to add it to my list of things to try.<p class=message>Speaking of things to try, have you been to any new restaurants or cafes recently?<p class="message sent">Actually, I went to a trendy brunch spot last weekend with my friends. The avocado toast was amazing.<p class=message>That sounds so good. I’ll have to check it out soon. Okay, let’s get back to work. We have some orders to fulfill!<p class="message sent">Right, let’s finish strong. Thanks for showing me how to make the mango smoothie.<p class=message>No problem, B. You’re catching on quickly. It’s always fun working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=88de12ca-7524-401d-a6f3-039f4a860a2b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
