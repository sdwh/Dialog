Can you please turn up the radio? I want to listen to some Australian music to get in the mood for our trip.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! *turns up the radio* How about I put on some AC/DC or Kylie Minogue for you?<p class=message>Oh, Kylie Minogue! She's such an icon in the music industry. Have you seen her live in concert before?<p class="message sent">I haven't unfortunately, but I've heard great things about her live performances. Maybe one day I'll get to see her!<p class=message>Definitely! So, have you ever been to Gold Coast before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's a beautiful place with plenty of things to do. Have you made any plans yet on what to do once you're there?<p class=message>Not yet, actually. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Oh, there are so many things to do! You can go to Dreamworld, Sea World, or Warner Bros. Movie World. Or if you're into nature, you can go to the hinterland and explore the rainforest.<p class=message>Wow, that all sounds amazing! I think I'll have to do all of those things. By the way, have you had breakfast yet?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I've got some snacks in my bag if you're hungry. Would you like a bar of chocolate or a bag of chips?<p class="message sent">That's really kind of you, thank you! I'll take the bar of chocolate.<p class=message>Sure thing, here you go! *hands over the chocolate*<p class="message sent">*takes a bite* Mmm, this is tasty! What brand is it?<p class=message>It's a Cadbury Dairy Milk bar. Have you ever had it before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. It's delicious though! Thanks again for sharing it with me.<p class=message>Of course, I always like to share. Hey, do you mind if I take a quick nap? I didn't sleep too well last night.<p class="message sent">Not at all, go ahead. Just let me know if you need anything when you wake up.<p class=message>Thank you so much, you're a great driver. Wake me up when we get there! *dozes off*</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7326793e-ddc2-4878-9914-8e91f8dc7b34.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
