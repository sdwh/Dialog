How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty well. Just spent the morning trying to figure out our software deployment process.<p class=message>Ah, I know what you mean. We've been struggling with that too. Have you thought about incorporating some automation?<p class="message sent">That's actually what I was just looking into. Do you have any tips?<p class=message>Well, we've started using a continuous integration and continuous deployment tool. It's helped us streamline the process a lot.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Which tool are you using?<p class=message>We're using Jenkins. It's open-source and pretty easy to set up.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I've heard of Jenkins before. Is it really that easy to use?<p class=message>For us it was. Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty straightforward. Plus, there are a lot of resources online to help.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. How did your team respond to the changes?<p class=message>They were skeptical at first, but after seeing the time and effort it saved us, they're fully on board now.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I think I'll give Jenkins a try and see how it works for us.<p class=message>Awesome. Let me know if you need any help getting started.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks for the advice, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Happy automating!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=faf45291-6573-465f-8f1d-61105d9566ba.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
