What about you?<p class=message>It's my first time playing, but I'm really liking it so far.<p class="message sent">That's great! What character did you choose?<p class=message>I chose a mage. I like the idea of using magic to defeat enemies.<p class="message sent">Nice choice! I chose a warrior. I just like to chop things up with my sword.<p class=message>Haha, sounds like fun. Have you joined any guilds yet?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm part of this really active guild. We do raids together and it's a lot of fun.<p class=message>That's awesome. I haven't joined a guild yet but I'm thinking about it.<p class="message sent">You definitely should! It's a great way to level up faster and make friends in the game.<p class=message>I'll definitely consider it. Have you ever completed any difficult quests?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've completed a few really hard quests. It took me a while but it was a great feeling once I completed them.<p class=message>That's amazing. I hope I can complete some difficult quests too.<p class="message sent">You will! It just takes time and dedication. We can play together and complete quests sometime.<p class=message>Sounds great to me!
