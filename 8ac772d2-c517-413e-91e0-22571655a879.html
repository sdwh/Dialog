Are you our driver for today's trip to Perth?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct! My name is David. Nice to meet you!<p class=message>I'm Alice. Nice to meet you too, David. How long have you been driving in Perth?<p class="message sent">I've been driving here for about 10 years now. Perth is a beautiful city and I love my job!<p class=message>That's great to hear. What are some places that you would recommend us to visit during our stay here?<p class="message sent">You should definitely visit Kings Park, it's one of the most popular tourist attractions in Perth. The beach at Cottesloe is also a must-see.<p class=message>Oh, we love beaches! Thanks for the suggestion. By the way, do you have any favourite music you like to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">I love listening to classic rock music while driving. It just keeps me energised throughout the day.<p class=message>That's cool. How about you, do you have a go-to song that never fails to lift your mood?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's "Don't Stop Believing" by Journey. It's a classic!<p class=message>That song is a classic indeed! So, do you pick up a lot of tourists like us?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. I get to meet people from all over the world and it's always interesting to learn about their cultures and experiences.<p class=message>It sure is! Have you ever travelled to other countries yourself?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been to a few countries in Southeast Asia. Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia are some of my favourites.<p class=message>That's awesome. Maybe one day we can hire you again to drive us around those countries!<p class="message sent">Absolutely! That would be a great adventure. Here we are, we've arrived in Perth. Enjoy your stay and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8ac6fc71-6970-4b24-94df-225a9b0c4688.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
