What can I make for you tonight?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of something new and unique for our menu. Can you recommend a special cocktail?<p class=message>Definitely! How about a Foshan Fling? It's a local favorite here in Foshan, made with lychee liqueur, grapefruit juice, and a splash of triple sec.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Can you mix up a couple of those for us to try?<p class=message>Sure thing! (starts shaking up the ingredients and pouring them into a chilled glass) Here you go, the Foshan Fling.<p class="message sent">(takes a sip) This is fantastic! I love the blend of flavors. How did you come up with this recipe?<p class=message>Oh, I've been experimenting with different combinations for a while now. I like to create something that's refreshing and unexpected.<p class="message sent">Well, you definitely succeeded with this one. Let's put it on the menu.<p class=message>Great idea! And if you want to get creative with the presentation, we could serve it in a lychee fruit or grapefruit peel.<p class="message sent">I like the way you think. Let's do both and make it extra special for our customers.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. So, what other ideas do you have for the menu?<p class="message sent">I was also thinking of adding a spicy twist to a classic cocktail like a margarita. Do you have any suggestions?<p class=message>How about a Sichuan Margarita? We can infuse some Sichuan peppercorns into the tequila and add some fresh lime juice and a hint of agave nectar for sweetness.<p class="message sent">That's brilliant! I think our customers would love that. Let's make it happen.<p class=message>You got it. I'll start experimenting with the recipe and we can try it out next week.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Thanks for your creative expertise, A. Our cocktail menu is going to be the talk of the town.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c7f2b4aa-9823-4567-8b28-55a3b83532ff.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
