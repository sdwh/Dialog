I'm excited to work with you.<p class="message sent">Hey A, of course! I'm excited to work with you as well. So, what's the objective of this app?<p class=message>We want to create a social media app that looks great and runs smoothly. It should be easy to navigate and engaging to use.<p class="message sent">Sounds like my kind of project! What type of features are we looking at?<p class=message>We want a feed that shows posts from the people you follow, the ability to like and comment on posts, and a messaging system.<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds pretty standard. Do we have any branding guidelines to follow?<p class=message>Yes, we want to keep the color scheme consistent with our company's branding and make sure it's visually appealing.<p class="message sent">Got it, I'll make sure to keep that in mind. How about the fonts and layout?<p class=message>Let's go with a simple and clean layout with sans-serif fonts. We want it to be easy on the eyes and intuitive to use.<p class="message sent">Agreed, less is definitely more in this case. How about incorporating some graphics into the app?<p class=message>That's a great idea! We'll need some icons for the different features, and maybe some illustrations for the landing page.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I love creating icons and illustrations. What about user testing? When do we plan to test it?<p class=message>We plan to do user testing once we have a prototype ready. We'll want to test it on different devices and get feedback from a diverse group of users.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. How about animation and transitions? Do we want to incorporate any of that into the app?<p class=message>Yes, we want to incorporate some small animations and fluid transitions. It'll make the experience more enjoyable for users.<p class="message sent">I agree, it's the little details that really make an app stand out. Well, I think we have a solid plan. Let's get to work!<p class=message>Awesome, let's do it! Looking forward to working with you on this project, B.<p class="message sent">Same here, A! Let's make a great app together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6a3abcf6-0c75-41de-af79-3f256fa6ae4e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
