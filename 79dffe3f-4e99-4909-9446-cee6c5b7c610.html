It seems to be working fine.<p class=message>Really? That's great to hear! But I noticed some lag yesterday.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's weird. Did you report it to support?<p class=message>Not yet. I thought it was just temporary. But if it happens again, I'll definitely report it.<p class="message sent">Yeah, you should. That's what support is there for. They can find out what's causing the issue.<p class=message>True. Do you have any idea what might be causing the lag?<p class="message sent">It could be a lot of things. Maybe there are too many people using the system at the same time, or there's a problem with the network.<p class=message>Hmm, yeah that's possible. But I hope it's not a problem with our system hardware.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that would be bad. But our IT team is really good at maintaining the system.<p class=message>That's true. They're always on top of things. But I'm still worried about the performance issues.<p class="message sent">Don't worry too much. Just report it to support and they'll take care of it.<p class=message>Okay, I will. Thanks!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. And if you need any help, feel free to ask me.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. I'll keep that in mind.<p class="message sent">No problem. It's always good to help out a colleague.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=79dfb501-ab97-4bbc-aa88-36162c0fe950.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
