Have you made noodles before?<p class="message sent">No problem at all, happy to help. Yes, I have made noodles before, but not like this.<p class=message>What do you mean?<p class="message sent">Well, I've never made them by hand before. Usually, I use a machine. It's much easier that way.<p class=message>Yeah, it's definitely harder by hand, but the taste is worth it.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, what kind of noodles are we making today?<p class=message>We are making jjajangmyeon noodles. They are really popular in Korea. Have you ever had them?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What makes them different from other noodles?<p class=message>They are made with black bean sauce, which gives them a unique flavor. And we are going to make the sauce from scratch too.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds really interesting. I can't wait to try them.<p class=message>Me too. Speaking of the sauce, do you have any experience making it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. I've made it a few times before. It's not too difficult.<p class=message>Great, that's good to hear. I haven't actually made it before, so I'll be relying on you.<p class="message sent">No problem, I'll show you the ropes. So, how long do we need to knead the dough for?<p class=message>Ideally, we want to knead the dough for about 20 minutes, until it's nice and elastic.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. Should we start now?<p class=message>Yes, let's get to work. And if we start now, we can enjoy our delicious jjajangmyeon noodles with homemade sauce in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=16db47f7-8083-4a52-846f-1d0d3a960943.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
