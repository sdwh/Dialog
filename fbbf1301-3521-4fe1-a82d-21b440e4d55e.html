How's it going with the audit process?<p class="message sent">Hey, I'm doing good. You know, it's not everyday that we get to wear two hats. I'm trying to maintain my technical expertise and carry out my responsibilities as a department head at the same time.<p class=message>I can only imagine how hard that must be. But hey, you're doing great! Did you say you have already conducted the vulnerability scans?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have. As a matter of fact, our systems have been running pretty well since the last time we communicated.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. By the way, have you thought about the employees' failure response tests?<p class="message sent">Of course! Our HR department recently conducted a few drills, and I can proudly say that we fared pretty well, if I say so myself.<p class=message>That's reassuring! Oh, and before I forget, how about the maintenance of your Information Security Management System?<p class="message sent">We are still on top of it, as usual. Our quality control department has been in charge of the regular checks, and we have been meeting our Key Performance Indicators consistently.<p class=message>That's great to hear, B. You really have a reliable team!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. But I have to give them all the credit. They are a competent group of professionals.<p class=message>Speaking of professionals, have you had any experience with internal auditors?<p class="message sent">We have had quite a good experience, to be honest. It's good that we have a monitoring and review structure in place.<p class=message>That's true. Well, I can't thank you enough for taking the time to have this conversation with me, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always good to have a chat with you. And remember, if there's anything else that comes up, feel free to reach out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fbbeff4e-ea82-47d2-96dd-73a535796d05.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
