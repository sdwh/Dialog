How's the fishing been lately?<p class="message sent">Not bad, not bad. But I've been thinking about the future of our industry. What do you think is the next big thing?<p class=message>Well, I think we should focus on sustainable fishing practices. People are becoming more aware of environmental issues and they want to eat seafood that's caught responsibly.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. But how do we keep up with the demand while still being sustainable?<p class=message>I think we need to invest in new technology, like fishing drones or underwater cameras, to ensure that we're only catching what we need and not harming other marine life.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's an interesting idea. What about advances in aquaculture?<p class=message>Yes, that's another area that's been growing. I read that there's a lot of potential for farming salmon and other species in closed systems on land.<p class="message sent">Really? That could be a game changer. And it might even help reduce overfishing in certain areas.<p class=message>Exactly. Plus, it would give us more control over the quality and safety of the seafood we're producing.<p class="message sent">I like the sound of that. And who knows, maybe someday we'll even have seafood that's been lab-grown!<p class=message>Haha, you never know. But for now, let's focus on staying ahead of the curve and making sure our industry is sustainable and prosperous for years to come.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's an exciting time to be a fisherman!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1838570c-8988-4dd8-8c90-8c4b5b14e93c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
