It was pretty scary.<p class=message>Oh wow, what did you do?<p class="message sent">I tried to press all the buttons and call for help, but nothing worked. Eventually, someone heard me yelling and came to my rescue.<p class=message>That sounds scary. I hope I never get stuck in an elevator.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's definitely not a fun experience. But at least I learned how to say "help" in Japanese!<p class=message>That's a good point. It's always helpful to know a few key phrases in case of an emergency.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And it's also important to have a plan in case something goes wrong, like knowing where the nearest hospital or embassy is.<p class=message>I completely agree. It's better to be prepared than to panic in a stressful situation.<p class="message sent">Plus, it's always a good idea to keep a copy of important documents, like your passport, in case they get lost or stolen.<p class=message>Definitely. I always keep a digital copy on my phone as well, just in case.<p class="message sent">Smart thinking. You never know what could happen, so it's always better to be safe than sorry.<p class=message>Agreed. Have you ever had to use your travel insurance in an emergency?<p class="message sent">Fortunately, no. But it's always a good idea to have it just in case.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's better to pay a little extra for insurance than to be stuck with a huge medical bill.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And most policies also cover things like lost luggage or flight cancellations, which can be a huge headache otherwise.<p class=message>That's a good point. It's always better to have a backup plan.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=33c5c2a4-3770-42f3-a7be-d1a3b576c98f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
