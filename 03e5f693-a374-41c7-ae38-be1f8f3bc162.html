Can you recommend some seafood for your menu, Mr. B?<p class="message sent">Oh, sure thing! We love incorporating fresh catches from local fishermen. What kind of seafood do you specialize in?<p class=message>I mainly go for crabs and shrimp, but I've caught some good fish on my last trip. I can also recommend some oysters from a nearby bed.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! We already have some crab cakes and shrimp scampi, but we're always looking for new dishes. What's your favorite way to cook oysters?<p class=message>I like them raw on the half-shell, but fried oyster po' boys are also delicious. Do you have any customers who are into spicy food?<p class="message sent">Yes, some of our regulars love a kick of heat. We have a Cajun seafood boil and a curry seafood stew on our specials board. Would you like to try them?<p class=message>I'll definitely give them a taste. Speaking of heat, have you tried adding some wasabi to sushi rolls or sashimi?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We usually use soy sauce and ginger, but wasabi can add a new dimension to the flavor. Have you caught any squid or octopus recently?<p class=message>Not yet, but I heard they're on the move this season. I've seen some squid jigging boats around the area, so I might try that too.<p class="message sent">Let us know if you have fresh squid or octopus. We can make some calamari or octopus salad. Thanks for sharing your insights, A. We're excited to add more items to our menu.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=03e3c1de-d9e1-46bb-971a-d1a14a534a40.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
