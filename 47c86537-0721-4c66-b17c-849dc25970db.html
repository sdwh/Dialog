Just getting ready for our next scene.<p class=message>Yeah, we're shooting the big fight sequence today.<p class="message sent">I'm pumped. I've been practicing my moves all week.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear! Have you seen the new set design?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's amazing. The attention to detail is incredible.<p class=message>Our production designer is a magician. How's your wardrobe holding up?<p class="message sent">Pretty well. I feel like a superhero in this suit.<p class=message>Haha, that's the spirit. I think we're on schedule, too.<p class="message sent">That's great news. I'm looking forward to the wrap party.<p class=message>Speaking of which, any ideas for a wrap gift for the crew?<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe personalized coffee mugs?<p class=message>I like it. We can put the movie logo on them.<p class="message sent">Exactly. Hey, did you hear about that crazy stunt from yesterday's shoot?<p class=message>No, what happened?<p class="message sent">One of the stunt doubles fell and broke his arm.<p class=message>Oh no! Is he going to be okay?<p class="message sent">Yeah, he's getting surgery today. But it could have been way worse.<p class=message>Definitely. We'll have to make sure we have extra safety measures in place.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Hey, have you tried that new Thai place down the street?<p class=message>No, not yet. Is it good?<p class="message sent">I went there last night and it was amazing. We should go for lunch.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Maybe we can talk shop while we eat.<p class="message sent">Deal. I need some advice on my next project.<p class=message>I'm always happy to help. Let's finish up this scene and go grab some Pad Thai.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=47c8532f-8926-49e6-bd7f-5e89fda3b93d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
