How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi. I was just prescribed a new medication, but I'm a bit scared about the side effects I've heard about.<p class=message>Well, it's always good to be cautious! What specifically are you worried about?<p class="message sent">I read that it could cause really weird dreams... and honestly, that sounds terrifying.<p class=message>Ah, that's understandable. But just remember, not everyone experiences the same side effects. And if you do have any strange dreams, they will likely go away after a few days.<p class="message sent">Okay, that makes me feel better. Is there anything I can do to lessen the chance of having bad side effects?<p class=message>Definitely! Make sure to take the medication exactly as prescribed, and try taking it with food if that's recommended. Also, avoid alcohol while you're taking it.<p class="message sent">Got it. And what if I do experience a weird side effect?<p class=message>Well, it depends on the severity. Some are mild and don't require medical attention, while others may be more serious. It's always best to keep in touch with your doctor and let them know what's going on.<p class="message sent">Okay, that makes sense. Thanks so much for your help!<p class=message>Of course! And just remember, always read the medication guide and don't hesitate to seek medical help if needed.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks again! You've been a great help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6049836a-2f9f-4904-a392-7c9ab483a2e2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
