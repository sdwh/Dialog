How are you today?<p class="message sent">I’m doing well, A. Thanks for asking. How about you? How’s the development going?<p class=message>Pretty good, actually! We’ve been working on the iOS App and it’s coming along nicely.<p class="message sent">That’s great to hear! I’ve been watching some tutorials on the latest updates for Swift. Do you want me to share some of the new features with you?<p class=message>Sure, I’d love to hear about it. But let’s grab some coffee first.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Hey, have you tried the new café on the corner?<p class=message>Not yet. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Their coffee is top-notch and they have a killer breakfast sandwich.<p class=message>Alright, you’ve convinced me. Let’s go check it out after this meeting.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! By the way, did you hear that our team is going to have a game night next week?<p class=message>No, I hadn’t. That sounds fun! What games are we playing?<p class="message sent">We’re thinking of playing Cards Against Humanity or Settlers of Catan. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class=message>Hmm, how about Exploding Kittens? It’s always a crowd-pleaser.<p class="message sent">Good call! I’ll make sure to bring my copy.<p class=message>Speaking of games, have you checked out that new augmented reality game that’s been getting a lot of buzz lately?<p class="message sent">You mean the one where you catch virtual creatures using your phone’s camera? Yeah, I’ve played it a bit.<p class=message>It looks like fun. Maybe we should take a break from coding and go catch some creatures in the park during lunch break.<p class="message sent">Ha! I’m up for that challenge if you are.<p class=message>You’re on! Let’s aim for a high score and brag about it at the game night.<p class="message sent">Deal! Let’s finish up what we’re doing and head out for that coffee.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fafdc928-b045-4ee9-86b3-656e3d31a8cd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
