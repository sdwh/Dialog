Thanks for asking. I am doing fine.<p class=message>So, do you enjoy driving for a living?<p class="message sent">Oh definitely! It is always interesting to meet different people and see new places.<p class=message>Speaking of new places, have you ever been to Australia Gold Darwin before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have been there a few times. It is one of my favorite places to visit.<p class=message>What do you like most about it?<p class="message sent">Aside from the beautiful beaches and the vibrant city life, I also love their food. Have you tried their seafood?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Any recommendations?<p class="message sent">I highly recommend their barramundi and mud crab dishes. They are simply delicious!<p class=message>Sounds tempting! By the way, have you seen any kangaroos on the road when you're driving here?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have seen a couple of them. They are quite common in some parts of Australia.<p class=message>That's awesome! I'm looking forward to seeing one myself. Oh, and by the way, do you mind turning the music up a bit?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, sir. Hope you enjoy the ride.<p class=message>Thanks, I definitely will. Say, have you ever given someone a ride to the airport and then realized they forgot their passport?<p class="message sent">It happened once, and it was quite a challenge. Good thing we were able to retrieve it before the passenger's flight.<p class=message>That must have been stressful! But you handled it well.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I always make sure to keep my passengers safe and happy. We're almost at your destination. Have a pleasant stay in Darwin!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f510d070-dbe3-45f6-8d0d-199832d8aa68.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
