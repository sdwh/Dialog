Welcome to our restaurant. What can I get for you tonight?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Can I get a salmon roll and a tuna roll, please?<p class=message>Absolutely, coming right up. And for you, sir?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'll try a couple of your rice balls - one with pickled plum and one with grilled chicken.<p class=message>Great choices. It's always nice to see someone who appreciates the subtleties of these traditional foods.<p class="message sent">Yes, they really are quite delicious. And the presentation is really eye-catching too.<p class=message>Thank you! We take great pride in our work, and we're always trying to find new ways to make our food look as beautiful as it tastes.<p class="message sent">Well, you're certainly doing a great job. I can hardly wait to dig in!<p class=message>That's what we like to hear! And if you need any extra soy sauce or wasabi, don't hesitate to ask.<p class="message sent">Thanks - I don't know if I'll be able to handle the wasabi though. I'm not as adventurous as some people.<p class=message>Hey, that's perfectly fine. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to spiciness. That's why we always make sure to label our dishes so that people know what they're getting into.<p class="message sent">That's a good policy. I appreciate when restaurants are up front about their ingredients and flavors.<p class=message>Definitely. It's important to be transparent, especially with food allergies or dietary restrictions. We want everyone to be able to enjoy our cuisine without worry.<p class="message sent">Well said. It's been a pleasure chatting with you. I'm really excited to try these rice balls now!<p class=message>Same to you - and I'm sure you'll love them. Enjoy!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=48852cfa-abde-445b-b9ea-2577765ae404.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
