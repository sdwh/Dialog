Do you live around here or are you just visiting?<p class="message sent">I'm just here for a few days, trying to see as much as possible. Have you lived here your whole life?<p class=message>Yeah, been driving this cab for over 20 years. There's still so much of Perth I haven't seen though!<p class="message sent">Really? What's your favorite part of the city?<p class=message>I really like the beaches. Scarborough and Cottesloe are my favorites. Have you been to any of them yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard they're beautiful. How long does it take to get to King's Park from here?<p class=message>With no traffic, it'll take about 10-15 minutes. But if there's a lot of traffic, it could take up to 30 minutes.<p class="message sent">Oh, okay. Do you have any recommendations for things to do in King's Park?<p class=message>You could check out the Botanic Garden, or take a walk along the Lotterywest Federation Walkway. And if you're hungry, there's a great caf√© called Frasers.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Thanks for your suggestions.<p class=message>No problem! Just let me know if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Actually, do you know where I can find a good souvenir shop around here?<p class=message>There's a souvenir shop called WA Wonders on Murray Street. It's a bit touristy, but they have some unique items.<p class="message sent">Perfect, thanks for your help.<p class=message>No worries, glad to help. Are you planning on doing anything else in Perth today?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm heading to Fremantle later to check out the markets. Have you been there before?<p class=message>Oh yeah, Fremantle's great. There are some really cool shops and restaurants down there. Make sure you try some fish and chips from Cicerello's!<p class="message sent">Will do! Thanks again for all your recommendations.<p class=message>No problem, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=36bf3ed8-809a-4e0e-8608-804799e2cdb7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
