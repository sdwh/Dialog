Why do you ask?<p class=message>How about we play a game of go together?<p class="message sent">Sounds great! I used to play it a lot with my dad.<p class=message>You know, go is known as the Japanese version of chess.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. I've always thought of it as a game of strategy.<p class=message>Have you ever played online?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I prefer to play the traditional way.<p class=message>Me too, but playing online has its perks. You can play with players from all over the world.<p class="message sent">That's true. But I prefer to see the person I'm playing with face to face.<p class=message>I understand. You know, in Asia, go is considered a major sport.<p class="message sent">Really? That's pretty cool. What other board games are popular over there?<p class=message>Well, mahjong is quite popular in China, and shogi is big in Japan.<p class="message sent">I've heard of shogi, but I've never played it. I'll have to look it up.<p class=message>Do you want to make this game interesting and put a wager on it?<p class="message sent">Sure, what do you have in mind?<p class=message>How about the loser has to buy the winner dinner?<p class="message sent">You're on! But I warn you, I'm pretty ruthless at this game.<p class=message>We'll see about that. Let's set up the board and get started.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9894cf99-68d7-439c-ad0f-8b20b9df2364.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
