How's your homework coming along?<p class="message sent">Hey, Dad. It's good. Just finishing up some math problems now.<p class=message>Math, huh? I always found that subject tough. Do you need any help?<p class="message sent">It's okay, Dad. I think I got it. But thanks for offering.<p class=message>Alright, let me know if you need any assistance. I'll be in the living room watching some TV.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Oh, by the way, Dad, did you know that elephants are the only animals that can't jump?<p class=message>Really? I had no idea. I guess they're grounded.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and did you also know that some turtles can breathe through their butts?<p class=message>Now that's something I never heard before. That's pretty funny.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool too. At least they have a backup plan if necessary.<p class=message>Haha, yeah, I guess they do. Thanks for sharing those interesting facts.<p class="message sent">No problem, Dad. Always happy to teach you some new things.<p class=message>So, do you want to take a break from homework and play some video games with me?<p class="message sent">Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Let's do it.<p class=message>Alright then, let's go to the game room and see who can beat who.<p class="message sent">You're on, Dad!
