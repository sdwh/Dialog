It sounds like a fancy-schmancy way of testing security systems.<p class=message>That's a good way to put it. But it's also an essential part of ensuring a business's cybersecurity.<p class="message sent">I guess that means it's not all fun and games.<p class=message>No, definitely not. But that doesn't mean we can't make it interesting.<p class="message sent">Alright, hit me with some interesting facts.<p class=message>Did you know that in some cases, the pen testers get to play the role of the "bad guy" and use their skills to hack into a company's systems?<p class="message sent">That sounds like a villain's job. I hope they aren't using evil laughter while doing it.<p class=message>Haha, I hope not too. But they do get to use some pretty cool tools, like vulnerability scanners and social engineering techniques.<p class="message sent">Wow, I didn't think penetrating could be so sophisticated.<p class=message>Well, when it comes to cybersecurity, you have to stay one step ahead of the hackers.<p class="message sent">Right, and that's why ISO 27001 Penetration Testing is so important.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's a way to proactively identify weaknesses before they can be exploited.<p class="message sent">Looks like I have some studying to do.<p class=message>Don't worry, we can learn together. And who knows, maybe one day we'll be the ones doing the pen testing.<p class="message sent">Now that's a cool job title. Penetration Tester, at your service!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c604bb93-fb8a-494a-96f8-5b54a5f458a6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
