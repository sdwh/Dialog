How about you?<p class=message>Same here! What character are you playing as?<p class="message sent">I'm a Paladin. What about you?<p class=message>I'm a Mage. I love being able to unleash some powerful spells on my enemies.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's definitely a plus. Although I must say, I think my armor is a bit cooler than yours.<p class=message>Hey now, don't hate on the robe! It's practical, and I can move around more freely without all that clunky armor.<p class="message sent">Well, I guess you have a point there. So, have you done any dungeons recently?<p class=message>Yeah, I just completed the Scarlet Monastery. It was tough, but we managed to get through it.<p class="message sent">Nice! I haven't done that one in a while. Maybe we can team up and do it together sometime?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Hey, have you seen any weird glitches in the game lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, now that you mention it...My character's arms seemed to have disappeared in one of the cutscenes. It was pretty creepy.<p class=message>Haha, that sounds like something out of a horror game. Well, hopefully that doesn't happen again.<p class="message sent">Yeah, for sure. So, what do you think of the latest expansion?<p class=message>I'm really enjoying it so far! The new zones are beautiful, and I'm excited to see what new adventures are in store.<p class="message sent">Same here! It seems like there's always something new to discover in this game.<p class=message>Absolutely. That's what makes it so addictive!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bbfc7db3-3082-441b-838c-ff57c6c46b14.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
