How's it going in the kitchen today?<p class="message sent">Pretty good, thanks. We've got a lot of prep work to do for tonight's service.<p class=message>Yes, speaking of tonight, I wanted to talk to you about the menu. I'm thinking of adding a few new items.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. What did you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking maybe a seared tuna salad and a pumpkin risotto.<p class="message sent">Hmm, those both sound really interesting. Have you thought about what kind of ingredients you want to use?<p class=message>For the tuna salad, I was thinking we could use some locally sourced microgreens and a wasabi vinaigrette.<p class="message sent">Nice. And for the risotto?<p class=message>I was thinking we could use some seasonal squash and maybe some crispy fried sage on top.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious. I think those dishes will be really popular.<p class=message>Great, I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any other suggestions for the menu?<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking maybe we could add a vegetarian option to the entrees.<p class=message>That's a good idea. What did you have in mind?<p class="message sent">How about a roasted cauliflower steak with a romesco sauce and some grilled asparagus on the side?<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing! I'm definitely adding that to the menu.<p class="message sent">Glad to hear it. I think our customers will really appreciate having more vegetarian options.<p class=message>Yes, I agree. Thanks for your help with the menu. Let's get started on prepping those new dishes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=160e3d7e-434f-47af-b99f-5c532a5c2d12.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
