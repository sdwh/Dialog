It's amazing!<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It looks fantastic, but there are still some bugs we need to squash.<p class=message>Tell me about it. It's like every time we fix one bug, two more appear out of nowhere.<p class="message sent">Ahh, the joy of software development. But at least we're not dealing with hardware issues.<p class=message>True, that would be a nightmare. So, have you come up with any creative solutions for the bugs we're facing?<p class="message sent">I think I have a few ideas. Maybe we can try to implement some unit testing to catch those pesky bugs.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. We should also make sure to document our code properly, just in case we need to revisit it later.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And speaking of revisiting, have you seen the latest episode of that show we were talking about last week?<p class=message>No, I haven't had a chance to catch up on it yet. Is it as good as everyone's saying?<p class="message sent">Definitely! You need to watch it ASAP. But maybe not while we're in the middle of debugging this app.<p class=message>Haha, good point. I guess we should stay focused for now. By the way, do you want to grab some coffee later and take a break from coding?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. And who knows, maybe while we're taking a break, we'll come up with a solution for that stubborn bug we've been dealing with.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ac499459-5c68-48bf-b2ee-19620358d9c2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
