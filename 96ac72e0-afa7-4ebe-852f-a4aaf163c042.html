It's a certification for information security management systems, right?<p class=message>Exactly! I just finished studying all the requirements for it.<p class="message sent">Wow, you must be really good at information security.<p class=message>Well, I try my best.<p class="message sent">So, what do you think are the biggest challenges with the audit process?<p class=message>I think it's mostly about documentation and making sure everything is up to date and organized.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's definitely important. But what about the actual implementation of the security measures?<p class=message>That's also crucial, but I think if you have the right policies in place, implementation is just a matter of following those policies.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. Have you ever been through an ISO 27001 Audit before?<p class=message>Not personally, but I have some colleagues who have. They said it was pretty intense.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I can imagine. I bet they were relieved once it was over.<p class=message>Oh yeah, they definitely were. But they also said it was worth it because it gave them a lot more confidence in their information security practices.<p class="message sent">That's a really good point. Do you think our company should get certified?<p class=message>I do. I think it would be a great way to demonstrate to our clients that we take their data security seriously.<p class="message sent">Agreed. But it sounds like there's a lot of work involved. Are you up for the challenge?<p class=message>Absolutely! I love a good challenge.<p class="message sent">Haha, I can tell. Well, let's get to work then.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=96a78f15-63ea-4d22-82b8-09f2c4a48c55.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
