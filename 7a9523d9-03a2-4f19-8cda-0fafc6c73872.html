What platform are you thinking of migrating to?<p class=message>I was thinking about moving to MySQL from SQL Server.<p class="message sent">Well, MySQL is a good choice. It's one of the most widely used databases out there and it runs on almost every platform.<p class=message>That's true. But what about problems that might arise during the migration? I don't want to lose any important data.<p class="message sent">You should definitely do a trial run before committing to the migration. And make sure you have a good backup strategy in case something goes wrong.<p class=message>That's a good point. Do you have any tips on how to make the migration easier?<p class="message sent">One thing you can do is to use a tool that can automate the migration process. There are a lot of them out there that can do everything from schema conversion to data transfer.<p class=message>I'll have to look into that. But what if I need to go back to my old platform?<p class="message sent">In that case, you might want to consider using a tool that can keep your data in sync between the two platforms. That way you can switch back and forth easily.<p class=message>Interesting. Have you used any tools like that before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've used a few different ones. I can send you some links later.<p class=message>Thanks! And what about cross-platform support? Will MySQL work on all the platforms that SQL Server does?<p class="message sent">MySQL is pretty good when it comes to cross-platform support. It runs on Linux, Windows, macOS, and more.<p class=message>That's great. I really appreciate your help with this.<p class="message sent">No problem. Just remember to do plenty of testing before making any permanent changes to your data.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7a8e0825-778a-4fa8-8caf-b816cba71471.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
