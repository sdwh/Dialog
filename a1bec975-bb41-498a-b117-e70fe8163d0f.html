I heard that you recently did some penetration testing on our system. How did it go?<p class="message sent">Hey A, it went well! I was able to find a few vulnerabilities in our codebase.<p class=message>That's great to hear! What kind of vulnerabilities did you discover?<p class="message sent">I found some SQL injection vulnerabilities in our login page, and an open redirect vulnerability in one of our links.<p class=message>Oh no! Those are not good. Did you inform the necessary teams and are we getting them patched soon?<p class="message sent">We're on it! I already reported it to the security team and our developers are actively working on fixing the issues.<p class=message>Excellent! We really appreciate your work in helping to strengthen our system's security.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure, I always enjoy digging for these bugs and closing up holes.<p class=message>I bet you do! Speaking of which, have you seen that new hacking movie that just came out?<p class="message sent">Oh, are you talking about "Hackers" from the 90s?<p class=message>Haha, no! I'm talking about the new one with Chris Hemsworth, it's called "Blackhat".<p class="message sent">Oh, yeah, I saw the trailers for that. It looks pretty good actually, have you seen it?<p class=message>Yeah, it was pretty intense! They had a really realistic portrayal of hacking and cybersecurity.<p class="message sent">That's impressive! I'm always skeptical about how Hollywood depicts hacking and cybersecurity in movies.<p class=message>I know what you mean! They always seem to go for the flashy and unrealistic stuff.<p class="message sent">But hey, at least it's getting people more interested in the field, right?<p class=message>Absolutely! We need more people interested in cybersecurity to help defend our systems from cyber threats.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Speaking of which, I should get back to work on fixing those vulnerabilities. Thanks for the chat, A!<p class=message>No problem, B! Keep up the great work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a1bae51e-b532-42d5-ade3-16a629f8b475.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
