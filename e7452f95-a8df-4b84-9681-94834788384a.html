It's such a beautiful city.<p class="message sent">Yes, Kobe is known for its thriving arts scene. Did you know that the city has a long history of art development?<p class=message>I actually didn't know that. Can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Of course. Kobe was one of the first cities in Japan to open up to foreign trade in the late 19th century, which led to an influx of foreign artists and their styles.<p class=message>That's really interesting. I can definitely see the influence in some of the pieces we've seen so far.<p class="message sent">Yes, and the city also has a strong tradition of Noh and Kabuki theater, which has inspired a lot of the visual arts as well.<p class=message>I had no idea about that. Thanks for sharing.<p class="message sent">No problem. And speaking of visual arts, did you have any favorite pieces at the museum so far?<p class=message>Definitely the sculpture of the dancing woman. It's so intricate and beautiful.<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. That's one of the most popular pieces here. Did you know that the artist who created it was actually from Kobe?<p class=message>Wow, I guess the city really does have a rich artistic heritage.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And with support from the local government, Kobe continues to foster and showcase new talent in the arts.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I really hope to see more from Kobe's artists in the future.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's a truly special city when it comes to art and culture.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e742cd40-fc3d-49a0-bef6-3769ece01153.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
