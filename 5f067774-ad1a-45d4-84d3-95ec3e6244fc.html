How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Morning, A! I’m doing pretty well, thank you. Just getting ready to make some delicious coffee. And you?<p class=message>I’m doing great! I’m excited to make some mouthwatering pastries to go with your coffee.<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic. What kind of pastries are you thinking of making today?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of making some buttery croissants filled with almond paste, some crumbly shortbread cookies, and maybe some miniature cheesecakes. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Oh, my mouth is watering already! Those all sound amazing. I think I’ll make some cappuccinos and lattes to go with them.<p class=message>Excellent. I’ve been practicing my pastry skills, so I think they’ll turn out even better than before.<p class="message sent">You always make amazing pastries, A. I’m sure they’ll be delicious.<p class=message>Thank you! I actually have a question for you. What’s the difference between a latte and a cappuccino?<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. A latte is made with espresso, steamed milk, and a small layer of frothed milk on top. A cappuccino, on the other hand, is made with equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and frothed milk on top.<p class=message>Thank you for that! I’ve always been too shy to ask.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It’s always good to learn more about different drinks and dishes.<p class=message>These pastries turned out even better than I thought they would! I can’t wait to hear what you think of them.<p class="message sent">Oh my goodness, these are fantastic! The croissants are so buttery and flaky and the cheesecakes are perfect. You really outdid yourself, A.<p class=message>Thank you so much, B! That means a lot coming from such a talented barista.<p class="message sent">It’s always a pleasure to work with you, A. I could taste the care and effort you put into these pastries.<p class=message>That’s so kind of you to say. I’m glad we make such a great team.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And I’m already looking forward to our next collaboration. Who knows what delicious treats we’ll come up with next time?<p class=message>I can’t wait to find out. Thanks, B!<p class="message sent">No problem. See you soon, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5f02b4c7-3504-4437-be52-de72216f5f28.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
