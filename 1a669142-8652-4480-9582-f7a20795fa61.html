It helps businesses manage their risk and protect their information assets.<p class="message sent">Interesting, but where do I start?<p class=message>Well, the first step is to conduct a risk assessment. Identify all the potential threats to your information security.<p class="message sent">Got it. So, what are some security risks you've heard of?<p class=message>Well, there's phishing attacks, malware, and even unauthorized access to systems.<p class="message sent">Yikes. It sounds like a lot to handle.<p class=message>Don't worry, ISO 27001 provides guidelines and controls to help you manage those risks effectively.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. I definitely don't want any security breaches in my company.<p class=message>Absolutely. Not only can they be costly, but they can also damage a company's reputation.<p class="message sent">True. So, how often do you think we should conduct a risk assessment?<p class=message>It's recommended to do it at least once a year, or whenever there's a significant change in the company's operations.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. Hey, do you have any tips for securing company data while working from home during the pandemic?<p class=message>Definitely. Use a VPN, avoid using public Wi-Fi, and be mindful of phishing emails.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the helpful tips, A.
