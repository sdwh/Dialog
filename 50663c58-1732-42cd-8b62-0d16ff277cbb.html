How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Not too bad, just busy with work as usual. How about you?<p class=message>Same here, the ISO 27001 audit is keeping me on my toes. Have you had any interesting findings so far?<p class="message sent">Actually, yeah! We discovered that one of our employees had been using their work email for dating purposes.<p class=message>That's hilarious! Did you have to report it?<p class="message sent">Yeah, unfortunately. We have to take all incidents seriously, even if they do provide a bit of entertainment.<p class=message>I know what you mean. I once found a stash of candy hidden in a server room during an audit. It was a nice break from all the seriousness.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a sweet discovery. Speaking of sweet, have you tried the new cafe down the street? They have amazing pastries.<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm definitely going to put that on my to-do list. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class="message sent">No problem. It's always good to take a break and indulge a bit during these intense audits.<p class=message>Absolutely. We work hard, but we also need to take care of ourselves. This job can be challenging, but it's also rewarding.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. It's amazing to see how our efforts can make such a positive impact on the company's security measures.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=506492f8-a13b-43ca-889f-f9e407d8a04a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
