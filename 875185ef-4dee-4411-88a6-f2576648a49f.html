How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. I've been working on a new travel app and I was hoping to get your opinion on something.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'd be happy to help. What do you need?<p class=message>I'm trying to design a itinerary planning feature that's user-friendly and interactive. Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Well, have you thought about incorporating some sort of drag-and-drop functionality so users can easily rearrange their itinerary?<p class=message>That's a good idea! I was also thinking about using visual cues, like icons or color-coding, to help users distinguish between different types of activities.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And maybe you could include a calendar view that shows the user's entire trip at a glance.<p class=message>Great ideas. And what about allowing users to save multiple itineraries for different trips?<p class="message sent">Yes, and you could even let them share their itineraries with friends or family members who are traveling with them.<p class=message>I love it! This is exactly the type of input I was hoping to get.<p class="message sent">No problem. It's always helpful to bounce ideas off of someone else. Do you need help with anything else?<p class=message>Not right now, but thanks again for your help. It's much appreciated.<p class="message sent">Anytime, happy to help out. Let me know if you need anything else!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=874f71dc-eea7-488e-9069-078b40b984cc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
