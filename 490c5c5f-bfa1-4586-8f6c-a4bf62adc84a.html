How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey, pretty good. What brings you here today?<p class=message>Just grabbing some coffee and wanted to brainstorm some ideas with you.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. What's on your mind?<p class=message>I'm thinking of revamping our online ads. What metrics do you think we should focus on?<p class="message sent">Well, definitely click-through rates and conversions. But also consider engagement and bounce rates.<p class=message>Good point. I was thinking of trying some new ad formats too, like video ads. Do you think that would work?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Video ads tend to have higher engagement rates and can be a great way to tell a story.<p class=message>That's what I was thinking too. What about our target audience? Do you have any insights on that?<p class="message sent">Based on our previous market analysis, we know that our main audience is primarily millennials who are interested in technology and social media.<p class=message>Right, that's what I remember too. I was thinking of creating some social media campaigns specifically targeted towards them.<p class="message sent">That's a smart move. And don't forget to track and analyze the results so we can continuously improve our campaigns.<p class=message>Definitely. Thanks for your insights. This coffee is on me!<p class="message sent">Haha, thanks. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=490535b4-9136-466e-9410-82c6aa410085.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
