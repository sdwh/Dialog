That's hard to believe. It looks so beautiful and well maintained now.<p class=message>Yup, the city put a lot of effort into turning it into what it is today. Oh look, there's a group of people doing yoga over there.<p class="message sent">Wow, they're really flexible. Maybe we should try it out sometime.<p class=message>Haha, I don't think my old bones are up for it, but I'll watch you stretch like a rubber band.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well, I don't think I'm that flexible yet, but maybe someday.<p class=message>Speaking of flexibility, how's your soccer practice going? I heard you're trying out for the team.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's been pretty intense, but I'm determined to make the cut. I hope I can make you proud.<p class=message>Son, you already make me proud just by being you. (pats B on the back)<p class="message sent">(smiles) Thanks dad, that means a lot to me.<p class=message>Hey, look at that duck family waddling around. You remember when we used to come here and feed them bread when you were little?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I do. Those were good times. Can we feed them again?<p class=message>Sorry son, we can't do that anymore. Feeding them bread is actually not good for their health.<p class="message sent">Oh, I didn't know that. Thanks for telling me.<p class=message>No problem. See, you learn something new every day. Isn't that the fun of life?<p class="message sent">It sure is dad. Thanks for taking me on this walk and spending time with me.<p class=message>Of course, anytime son. Now how about we head over to the ice cream truck before it gets too crowded?<p class="message sent">(excitedly) Yes, please!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=221d19e1-fb0e-4441-ae9e-5bfa29aac447.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
