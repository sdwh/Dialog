I'm so excited to have a vegetarian restaurant that serves fresh organic vegetables.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's an exciting venture for both of us. I've been researching different types of vegetables that we can use in our dishes.<p class=message>That's awesome. I can't wait to see what you come up with. What are some of the vegetables you recommend?<p class="message sent">We have some local greens such as kale and spinach, and then we have purple sweet potatoes and heirloom tomatoes.<p class=message>Those sound great! I'm already imagining some delicious salads and plates. We should also probably consider having a good variety of plant-based proteins too.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I was thinking of using lentils, chickpeas, and quinoa in our dishes. They're all high in protein and perfect for a vegetarian diet.<p class=message>Good plan. We should also make sure that our restaurant has a welcoming atmosphere, maybe incorporate some funky decor into the design, what do you think?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's important to create a friendly ambiance to make our customers feel comfortable. We should also provide some educational materials on the benefits of vegetarianism.<p class=message>Yes, that's a great idea. We want to make sure people understand that vegetarianism is not only good for the planet but also for their health.<p class="message sent">Exactly! We need to let people know that they can still get all the necessary nutrients from a vegetarian diet.<p class=message>Agreed. It's exciting to think about how we can make a positive impact in the Little India community with our vegetarian restaurant.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Let's get started on planning the menu and designing the interior. I'm looking forward to this project!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fcd6af71-3c57-427c-a3cd-78008243ede3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
