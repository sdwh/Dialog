What would you like today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I haven't decided yet. What do you recommend?<p class=message>If you like savory, try our freshly baked scallion pancakes. And for something sweet, our steamed custard buns are very popular.<p class="message sent">Hmm, those both sound tempting. I think I'll go with the scallion pancake and a cup of tea, please.<p class=message>Excellent choice. Our tea is one of our specialties. We use only the highest quality leaves.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. What kind of tea do you recommend with the scallion pancakes?<p class=message>I suggest our green tea. It has a light and refreshing flavor that complements the pancakes well.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. And how about something to cool off with? It's so hot outside today.<p class=message>We have a variety of iced drinks, from sweetened black tea to fruity smoothies. What are you in the mood for?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'll try the lychee smoothie. That sounds delicious.<p class=message>It certainly is. We use fresh lychee fruit and blend it with ice and a touch of milk for a smooth and creamy drink.<p class="message sent">Yum, I can't wait to try it. And while I'm here, maybe I'll grab a few custard buns to go for later.<p class=message>Good idea! I'll pack them up for you. Thank you for stopping by, and enjoy your meal and drink.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! I'll definitely be back.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=895001e7-58f8-4c4d-8364-6dcb4d119bf5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
