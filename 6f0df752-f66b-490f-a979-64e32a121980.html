I'm excited to see how it turns out. It's always interesting to work with new technologies.<p class=message>Absolutely! I'm glad we're using Razor Pages though. It makes it so much easier to work with dynamic pages.<p class="message sent">That's true. Plus, the fact that it's built in with MVC architecture makes it much more organized and structured.<p class=message>I agree. You know what else is great about Razor Pages? The fact that it's easy to use.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's definitely user-friendly. It takes the hassle out of coding and allows us to focus more on the functionality of the website.<p class=message>It's also scalable. So, we can easily add new pages and features to the website as the company grows and expands.<p class="message sent">Exactly. That's why it's a great choice for our internal website system. It's reliable and flexible.<p class=message>Hey, did you know that Razor Pages uses a UI-centric approach?<p class="message sent">Of course I know that! As a backend developer, I make sure to stay on top of all the latest front-end technologies.<p class=message>Well, aren't you impressive?! It sounds like we're in good hands with you handling the backend.<p class="message sent">Ha! Thank you. But let's not forget, we're a team. And we're only as strong as our weakest link.<p class=message>That's true. But I have a feeling that with your expertise and my front-end skills, we're going to make this internal website system a huge success!<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Let's get to work and make it happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6f0affe5-cd53-4ea8-8e24-a0afbafcc6f9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
