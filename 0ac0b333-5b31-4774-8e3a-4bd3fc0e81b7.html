What airline did you fly with and what terminal did you arrive at?<p class=message>I flew with Delta Airlines and arrived at Terminal 3.<p class="message sent">Great. You can find the baggage claim area just outside the arrival gate. Look for the signs that say "Baggage Claim".<p class=message>Thanks for the info! Do you know how long it will take for my bags to come out?<p class="message sent">It usually takes 20-30 minutes for the luggage to start coming out. But, sometimes it may take longer if the flight was delayed.<p class=message>Oh, I see. So, how was your day going so far?<p class="message sent">It's been busy, but good. How about yours?<p class=message>It's been a bit stressful with all the traveling, but it's good to know that there are helpful people around like you.<p class="message sent">Aw, well thank you. It's always nice to help someone out.<p class=message>Definitely, and speaking of helping out, do you have any tips for someone visiting this city for the first time?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do! Make sure to try the local food and visit some of the famous landmarks. And, don't forget to take a camera!<p class=message>Sounds like great advice. Thanks again for your help and have a good day!<p class="message sent">You're welcome and have a wonderful trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0abad50a-5204-4fcc-ba9b-6a6b677db5ae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
