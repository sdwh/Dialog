It's a standard for information security management systems, right?<p class=message>That's right, and it's becoming a big deal in the business world. Do you have any experience with it?<p class="message sent">Not personally, but I know a bit about encryption. Do you know much about it?<p class=message>Yeah, I've been studying it for my job. Basically, encryption is a way to protect data by scrambling it so that only someone with the proper key can unscramble it.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. So it's like code-breaking, right?<p class=message>Kind of, except that it's more about making sure that only authorized people can decode the information. Have you ever used encryption software?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Have you?<p class=message>Yeah, I've used a few different programs. It can be kind of confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad.<p class="message sent">What kinds of programs have you used?<p class=message>Well, there's TrueCrypt, which is a free program that's pretty popular. And then there's PGP, which is a little more advanced and can be used for things like email encryption.<p class="message sent">Hmm, sounds like something I should look into. Do you think it's important for companies to use encryption?<p class=message>Definitely. With so much sensitive information being stored and transferred digitally these days, it's crucial to have strong security measures in place. Plus, it can help prevent legal liability if there's a data breach.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that makes sense. I'll have to bring that up at our next company meeting.<p class=message>Definitely. And if you want some help getting started with encryption, just let me know.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate it. You really know your stuff when it comes to this kind of thing.<p class=message>(laughs) I try. It's all part of the job. But if there's anything else you ever need help with, just let me know.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3b349de8-b28e-47e8-9cee-67b322aba5bc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
