Why do you ask?<p class="message received message-content">I just tried them for the first time last night and they were amazing!<p class="message sent message-content">That's awesome! Did you cook them yourself?<p class="message received message-content">No, I went to a restaurant and ordered them there. But I think I'm going to try cooking them myself soon.<p class="message sent message-content">You should! Pork chops are actually pretty easy to cook. What seasoning did they use at the restaurant?<p class="message received message-content">I'm not sure, but it was definitely something savory. Do you have any suggestions for seasoning?<p class="message sent message-content">I like to keep it simple with just salt, pepper, and garlic powder. But you can also try marinating them first.<p class="message received message-content">Oooh, that sounds fancy. What kind of marinade would you recommend?<p class="message sent message-content">It really depends on your taste preferences. You can go sweet or spicy, or even try something with teriyaki sauce.<p class="message received message-content">I think I'll try the sweet one. Thanks for the tip!<p class="message sent message-content">No problem! Let me know how it turns out.<p class="message received message-content">Will do! But I also have a confession to make. I'm a little worried about overcooking the pork chops.<p class="message sent message-content">Don't worry, just make sure to use a meat thermometer and take them out when they reach an internal temperature of 145Â°F.<p class="message received message-content">Got it, thanks again for your help!<p class="message sent message-content">Anytime! And if all else fails, just order takeout.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=035afdff-3277-41df-b9f6-9e81da5479d1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
