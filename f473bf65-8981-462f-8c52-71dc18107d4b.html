How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing great today. How about you?<p class=message>I'm fantastic, thank you. We've had quite a few customers already this morning, all eager to try our Hong Kong-style dim sum.<p class="message sent">That's wonderful to hear, A. Speaking of which, have you tried my new batch of mango sago pudding? It's a personal recipe I picked up while on vacation in Hong Kong.<p class=message>No, I haven't tried it yet. But it sounds absolutely delicious! Can you bring some out for me to taste?<p class="message sent">Of course, A. Here you go.<p class=message>*takes a bite* This is amazing, B! I could eat this every day.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it. We should definitely add it to the dessert menu.<p class=message>Agreed. And speaking of the menu, have you noticed that our xiao long bao have been flying off the shelves lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's not surprising though, they're the best in town.<p class=message>Well, we have a secret ingredient that sets us apart. But I can't tell you what it is, or else it wouldn't be a secret!<p class="message sent">*laughs* Fair enough, A. But I have to say, your cooking skills are really impressive.<p class=message>Thank you, B. I've been doing this for a long time, and I have a genuine passion for it.<p class="message sent">I can tell. I wouldn't want to work with anyone else.<p class=message>That means a lot to me, B. We make a great team.<p class="message sent">We definitely do. And you know what would make our team even better? If we added some new items to the menu!<p class=message>Yes, that's a great idea. Any suggestions?<p class="message sent">How about we add some traditional Hong Kong street food, like curry fish balls and egg waffles?<p class=message>Brilliant! I think our customers would really enjoy those. Let's start working on the recipes today.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, A. I can't wait to see what we come up with.<p class=message>Me too, B. It's always exciting to try new things and push our boundaries.<p class="message sent">That's what cooking is all about!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f46e8e1f-e459-4720-aeb7-19d988618fd6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
