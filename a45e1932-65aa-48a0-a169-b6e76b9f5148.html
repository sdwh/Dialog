How about you?<p class=message>I'm good. It's nice to be working at this Korean restaurant - the food is delicious!<p class="message sent">I know right? And the customers seem to be enjoying it too.<p class=message>Definitely. It's interesting how different Korean food is from what I'm used to cooking.<p class="message sent">That's what makes it exciting though, right? Trying out new things and expanding our cooking skills.<p class=message>Yeah, I see what you mean. Hey, did you hear about the customer who came in yesterday and asked for ketchup on their bibimbap?<p class="message sent">What?! You're kidding, right?<p class=message>Nope, dead serious. Can you imagine? Ketchup on a dish that's already perfect as it is?<p class="message sent">Haha, that's hilarious. I guess some people just have strange preferences.<p class=message>Or they're just not familiar with the food, I guess. It's our job to help them experience true Korean cuisine.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Speaking of which, we have a big table coming in at 7 pm. We need to start prepping the ingredients ASAP.<p class=message>Right, I'll start slicing and marinating the meats. You want to start on the side dishes?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll get started on the kimchi and pickled veggies.<p class=message>By the way, have you tried the soju here yet? It's pretty strong stuff.<p class="message sent">Not yet, I haven't. But I'm definitely going to after we finish up with this group.<p class=message>Haha, sounds like a plan. Alright, let's get to work.<p class="message sent">Let's do it! Today's going to be a busy night, but we got this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a45baa97-8a50-4ff6-8c2b-29ee1feeba30.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
