What do you have for sale?<p class="message received message-content">Well, I've got this old record player that I'm looking to sell. It's in great condition and still has a lot of life left in it.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds interesting. How much are you asking for it?<p class="message received message-content">I'm looking to get around $50 for it, but I'm willing to negotiate.<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, that's a bit steep, would you be willing to go lower?<p class="message received message-content">How about $40? That's the best I can do for you.<p class="message sent message-content">Alright, I think I can work with that. Do you take cash or do you have a credit card reader?<p class="message received message-content">I take cash, or if you have Venmo, we can use that as well.<p class="message sent message-content">I have Venmo, so that works. Do you have the charger for the record player?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, I do. It comes with the charger and all of the cords you'll need to set it up.<p class="message sent message-content">Great, I'll take it then. Do you have any other cool items for sale?<p class="message received message-content">Actually, I have this vintage typewriter that's still in working condition. It's a really unique piece.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds awesome. How much are you asking for that?<p class="message received message-content">I'm hoping to get around $80 for it, but I'm open to negotiations.<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, that's a bit too much for me. Maybe next time. Thank you though!<p class="message received message-content">No problem, happy shopping!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0911b906-1c8e-4772-b111-ba3070e8d332.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
