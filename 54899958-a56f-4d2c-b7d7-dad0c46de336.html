What are you reading?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm reading a novel by Jane Austen. She's one of my favorite authors.<p class=message>Oh, I love her too! Which novel is it?<p class="message sent">It's "Pride and Prejudice." Have you read it?<p class=message>Yes, multiple times! It's a classic. But I must admit, I haven't read it in a while.<p class="message sent">You should definitely give it another read. The characters are so well-developed and the dialogue is witty.<p class=message>That's true. It's not just a love story; it's a commentary on the societal norms of the time.<p class="message sent">Exactly! I also appreciate how strong-willed and independent Elizabeth Bennet is as a female protagonist.<p class=message>Agreed! Speaking of strong independent women, have you heard of Ruth Bader Ginsburg?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. She was an inspiring figure who fought for gender equality and women's rights.<p class=message>Absolutely. She once said, "Fight for the things that you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you." It's a great quote to live by.<p class="message sent">I totally agree. By the way, have you seen the latest Marvel movie? It seems to have broken box office records.<p class=message>No, I haven't yet. But I've heard it's amazing. I'm a big fan of superhero movies.<p class="message sent">Same here! The special effects in this one are out of this world.<p class=message>Alright, it's settled. We should watch it together sometime.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me! Let's plan on it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=54819c67-3bf9-481f-bcc3-22f30282ec4e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
