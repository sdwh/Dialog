I hear that the seafood here in Zhuhai is amazing.<p class=message>That's what I've heard too. I'm just trying to find the perfect lobster for tonight's dinner.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds delicious. I'm in search of some large prawns for a family gathering tomorrow.<p class=message>Prawns do sound like a great idea. Have you found any good ones yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, I'm still on the hunt. But I did come across some really good squid earlier, and I might just have to pick some up.<p class=message>Squid is wonderful too! I'm so excited to cook up a feast tonight with all of the seafood we've gathered.<p class="message sent">Me too! I think that cooking with fresh ingredients really makes all of the difference.<p class=message>Absolutely. I also heard that this market has a great selection of fish. Have you had a chance to check it out?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. There were so many different varieties, it was hard to choose. I ended up getting some red snapper.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard that's really good. I think I might have to go take a look myself.<p class="message sent">Definitely do. And if you need any recommendations, just let me know.<p class=message>Thanks, same goes for you. It's great to have another foodie to swap tips with.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I think we might just be each other's good luck charms when it comes to finding the best seafood here.<p class=message>Haha, yes, I think you might be right. Can't wait to see what we both end up going home with.<p class="message sent">Same here. Enjoy the rest of your shopping trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b0c0b521-bac9-4065-b96c-0860aee629f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
