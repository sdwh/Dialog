Could you check on it for me?<p class="message sent">Oh no, I'm so sorry about that. Let me check with the kitchen and see what's going on.<p class=message>Thank you so much. I'm starving over here!<p class="message sent">I know the feeling! Waiting for food can be tough, but I'm sure it will be worth it.<p class=message>Well, I hope so! I'm looking forward to it.<p class="message sent">Is there anything else I can get you in the meantime? Maybe some bread or a drink?<p class=message>Actually, a drink would be great. I'll take a lemonade, please.<p class="message sent">Coming right up! And I'll make sure to check on your food as soon as possible.<p class=message>Thank you. You're such a helpful server.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. We want to make sure our customers have a great experience here.<p class=message>I can tell. This place has such a nice ambiance, and the menu looks amazing.<p class="message sent">Glad to hear that! We take great pride in our restaurant. I think you'll love the food once it arrives.<p class=message>I'm sure I will. Hey, maybe the delay is a good sign! Maybe they're taking extra care to make it perfect.<p class="message sent">That's a great way to look at it. I like your positive attitude!<p class=message>Thanks! I learned a long time ago that being grumpy doesn't solve anything.<p class="message sent">Wise words, my friend. And speaking of wisdom, have you tried our dessert menu yet?<p class=message>No, not yet. But if the food is as good as I think it will be, I might have to!<p class="message sent">Ha! I like your optimism. Let's hope your food arrives soon so you can make that decision.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7f87c839-dbdf-4bc9-b59c-4302c6928b1c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
