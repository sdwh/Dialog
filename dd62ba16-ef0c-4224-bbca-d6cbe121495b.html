Are you on your way to somewhere specific or just enjoying the ride?<p class=message>Oh, I'm heading to New York for a business meeting. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm just cruising around, trying to pick up as many fares as possible. You know how it is in this business.<p class=message>Yeah, I bet. So, do you have any interesting stories from your time as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. One time, I had a passenger who left a briefcase in my cab. I opened it up to see if I could find their contact information, and inside there was a huge wad of cash!<p class=message>Wow, that must have been quite a surprise. What did you do with the money?<p class="message sent">Well, I knew it wasn't mine to keep, so I tracked down the passenger and gave it back to them. But I have to admit, it was tempting to keep it!<p class=message>I don't blame you. So, what do you like most about driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">I love the freedom of the open road and meeting interesting people like you. Plus, the extra cash is always a nice bonus!<p class=message>Haha, I can imagine. Alright, we're almost at my destination. Thanks for the pleasant conversation and safe ride.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, and good luck with your meeting!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dd5e8a00-0c0b-4ecb-bd39-b57f1b7bd366.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
