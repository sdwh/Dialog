I love a good steak, especially when it's cooked just right.<p class=message>Same here! What's your favorite cut?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a tough one. I really enjoy ribeye for its juicy and tender texture.<p class=message>I agree, ribeye is delicious. But have you tried the porterhouse?<p class="message sent">Yes I have, and it's definitely a great choice for those who prefer a bigger portion.<p class=message>That's true, but don't forget about the filet mignon. It's a classic choice for those who want a tender and flavourful steak.<p class="message sent">You're absolutely right. Oh, and don't forget about the sides! Do you prefer fries or mashed potatoes to go with your steak?<p class=message>Personally, I opt for the mashed potatoes, but I do enjoy a good crispy fries as well. What about you?<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough choice. I think I'd have to go with fries. How about sauces? Do you like yours with gravy or something else?<p class=message>I'm more of a classic steak sauce kind of person. How about you?<p class="message sent">I like to mix things up and try different sauces. Have you ever had chimichurri with your steak?<p class=message>Yes, and it's delicious! It's a great way to add some zing to your steak. Have you tried any other fun toppings before?<p class="message sent">I remember having a blue cheese butter topping once, and it was out of this world!<p class=message>Oh wow, that sounds incredible. I might have to try making that myself sometime.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b9dd19a3-9f0c-45cd-a8e2-03f7be948125.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
