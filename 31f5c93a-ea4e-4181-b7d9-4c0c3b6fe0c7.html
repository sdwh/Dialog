Seafood is delicate and can become tough if it's cooked too much.<p class=message>That's good to know. What about seasoning?<p class="message sent">Seafood generally doesn't need a lot of heavy seasoning. You want to enhance its natural flavors with light spices and fresh herbs.<p class=message>Got it. What's your favorite seafood dish to cook?<p class="message sent">I love making a seafood paella with clams, squid, and prawns. It's a classic Spanish dish that's always a big hit.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'll have to try making that at home sometime.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Cooking seafood at home is a great way to impress your friends and family.<p class=message>Thanks for the tips, chef.
