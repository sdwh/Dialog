I'm in the market for a new suit and I was hoping you could help me out.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, sir! Our selection is top-notch. Is there a particular style or color you're interested in?<p class=message>Well, I usually go for classic navy or grey. But I'm not opposed to trying something new.<p class="message sent">How about this light blue suit? It's very trendy right now and looks great with a dark tie.<p class=message>Hmm, I don't know if I'm bold enough for that. Maybe I'll stick with the navy.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Let me grab a few options for you to try on. What's your preferred size?<p class=message>I usually wear a 42 regular.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll be right back with some suits that fit the bill.<p class=message>I'm really liking this one. How does it look?<p class="message sent">That color is fantastic on you, sir. And the fit is impeccable.<p class=message>Awesome. I'll take it!<p class="message sent">Fantastic! Would you like to have it tailored, or are you good to go as is?<p class=message>I think it fits pretty well, but some minor alterations wouldn't hurt. How long does that usually take?<p class="message sent">It varies, but we can have it ready for pick-up in about a week. Is that okay with you?<p class=message>Sounds good. Thanks for all your help today.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It was a pleasure helping you find the perfect suit. And don't forget, if you need anything else in the future, we're always here to assist you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=512d450a-3dec-421d-b970-e3b79d0edd45.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
