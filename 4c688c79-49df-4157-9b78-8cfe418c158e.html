How's it going today?<p class="message sent">Hello, A! It's going great. I can smell the wonderful aroma of your freshly baked croissants already!<p class=message>Thanks! And I can see your perfectly brewed green tea. I'm so excited to try it with my pastries.<p class="message sent">Yes, they go together really well. By the way, have you ever tried adding matcha powder to your croissants? It adds a great flavor.<p class=message>Oh, that's a good idea! I'll definitely try that sometime.<p class="message sent">And have you ever tried baking some Green Tea Financiers or Matcha Macarons?<p class=message>No, but I’d love to learn how to make those. Will you teach me?<p class="message sent">Sure! It's fun to work with tea in pastry-making. Combined with your dough, sugar and butter, it makes for a delicious treat.<p class=message>That sounds so good! I also have a new pastry recipe made with raspberry that I think you'll love.<p class="message sent">Raspberry? That's ideal to pair with the freshness of green tea. I'm sure it'll be a hit!<p class=message>Let's combine our expertise and make something incredible. Perhaps we can make matcha croissants with raspberry filling? How does that sound?<p class="message sent">Perfect, that'll be amazing! People will come from far and wide just to have a taste.<p class=message>Ha! I'm sure they will. We're going to make this pastry shop the talk of the town.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We'll be the hottest duo, a successful partnership combining French and Japanese flavors.<p class=message>With your expertise in tea and my knowledge of pastry, we’re unstoppable.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Together we'll create an unbeatable menu. I can't wait to see what else we come up with.<p class=message>Me too, B. Let's get to work and make some magic!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4c620ca9-9996-454b-ae19-234b5f051772.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
