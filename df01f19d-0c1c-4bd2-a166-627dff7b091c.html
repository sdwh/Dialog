I'm excited for our rock climbing training today!<p class="message sent">Hi! Me too, it's a great day for it. Have you climbed outdoors before?<p class=message>I have, but it's been a while. How about you, Coach?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've climbed all sorts of rocks in my time. It's one of the reasons I became a coach.<p class=message>That's awesome. I'm hoping to learn some new techniques today. What do you have in store for us?<p class="message sent">Well, we'll start with some boulder problems to warm up. Then we'll move onto the sea cliffs and work on some longer routes.<p class=message>Sounds good, I'm ready to challenge myself. Do you have any tips for maintaining a good grip on the rocks?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Always remember to keep your weight over your feet and try to grip with your toes as well as your fingers. And of course, always stay hydrated so you don't lose grip strength.<p class=message>Great advice, thanks. Do you have any funny or interesting stories from your years of climbing?<p class="message sent">Sure do. There was one time I was climbing a peak and a goat came up beside me, wanting to climb too!<p class=message>(laughs) Oh my, did it make it to the top?<p class="message sent">(grinning) It only got halfway up, but it was quite an experience!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=df00fb02-e286-48de-bae1-7bc0b945e626.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
