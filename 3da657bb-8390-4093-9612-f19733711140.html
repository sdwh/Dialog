What book are you reading?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I'm reading "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Have you read it before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's a hilarious book! Did you know that the number 42 in the book represents the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?<p class="message sent">Really? I didn't know that. No wonder it keeps popping up in the book.<p class=message>Exactly! So what's your opinion on the book so far?<p class="message sent">I absolutely love it! I can't stop reading it. The book's author, Douglas Adams, had a truly unique and comic perspective on the universe.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Speaking of unique perspectives, have you read any other books by Adams?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. What do you recommend?<p class=message>I highly recommend "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul". It's a witty and clever mystery novel that also features some of Adams' humor.<p class="message sent">Sounds intriguing. I'll definitely check it out.<p class=message>Great! Oh, by the way, I just finished reading "1984" by George Orwell. Have you read that one?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's a dark and thought-provoking book.<p class=message>Yes, it definitely made me reflect on the power of language and government control. Speaking of language, have you been practicing your English recently?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been watching English movies and listening to English podcasts.<p class=message>That's fantastic! It's always good to practice listening and speaking skills. We should also try to speak more English together in class.<p class="message sent">Yes, I completely agree. That way we can improve our fluency and communication skills.<p class=message>Definitely! And that way we can also have more interesting conversations about books like "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".<p class="message sent">Haha, I'm looking forward to it! Thanks for the recommendation, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to share good books with others.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3da41fee-c451-415a-b324-f34b496ffd31.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
