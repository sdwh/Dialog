It's so boring."<p class="message sent">"I think it's a documentary about bird migration. I find it quite interesting."<p class=message>"Bird migration? Yawn. I'd rather watch a good rom-com any day."<p class="message sent">"But we watched three rom-coms last weekend. I need some variety."<p class=message>"Variety? This is about as exciting as watching paint dry."<p class="message sent">"Well, I'm still enjoying it. There's something peaceful about watching birds fly."<p class=message>"Peaceful? There's nothing peaceful about these squawking birds. They're giving me a headache."<p class="message sent">"Maybe we could compromise and watch something with both birds and romance?"<p class=message>"Is that a thing? Romantic birds?"<p class="message sent">"Of course it is. There's that Disney movie with the lovebirds. I think it's called 'Rio'."<p class=message>"That sounds cute. Let's give it a try."<p class="message sent">"Finally! Some progress. Can I make some popcorn while we watch?"<p class=message>"Sure, but don't burn it again like you did last time."<p class="message sent">"Hey, that was just a small mistake. I know what I'm doing."<p class=message>"Well, let's hope so. I don't want to waste two hours watching burnt popcorn and squawking birds."<p class="message sent">"Don't worry, I'll make sure everything is perfect. You just sit back and enjoy the show."</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a1326d36-805c-40d2-968a-926e87c3a562.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
