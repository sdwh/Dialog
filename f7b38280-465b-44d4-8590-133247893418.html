It's great to meet another data enthusiast here. What brings you to the insurance industry?<p class="message sent">Hey, glad to meet you too. I'm a BI engineer and working on analyzing insurance claims and calculating risk probabilities. How about you?<p class=message>I'm a database administrator, I manage and maintain the insurance data, including the claims data that you use. Whom do you work with more often, claims adjusting team or the underwriting team?<p class="message sent">I mostly work with the claims adjusting team. We need to figure out the risk involved in insuring a policy holder based on their claim history.<p class=message>Oh, yea. I'm familiar with that. I work with the actuaries team to perform retroactive analysis of policies and settlements.<p class="message sent">That's interesting, how do you use the data to predict the future patters and risk probabilities?<p class=message>We use different techniques such as regression analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning algorithms to derive insights from the data to predict the future trends.<p class="message sent">That's cool, what kind of software tools do you use for data management and analysis?<p class=message>We utilize various database management systems and business intelligence platforms such as Oracle, SQL server, Tableau, and PowerBI.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a lot. Which one do you prefer the most?<p class=message>For performance reasons, I prefer Oracle, but I also like the visualization options of Tableau.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I agree with you. What do you think about the future of the insurance industry in terms of data analytics and BI?<p class=message>I think there will be a huge transformation using IoT, AI and Blockchain technologies that will help us to collect, analyze and gain insights from vast amounts of data.<p class="message sent">You're right. What other industries do you think can benefit from data analytics?<p class=message>Almost every industry can benefit from data analytics including healthcare, finance, retail, manufacturing, transportation, etc. It's a fast-growing field.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It was great meeting you, we should collaborate sometime to bring more value to our clients.<p class=message>Sure, that sounds great!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f7b10f21-9b8d-4927-af26-efb9b30e741d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
