How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not bad, A. Just trying to get the hang of this beach volleyball thing. It's not as easy as it looks!<p class=message>Oh yeah, it takes some practice. But don't worry, I'll show you some tricks.<p class="message sent">Thanks, coach! So what's the first thing I need to know?<p class=message>Well, the key here is to control your body as much as the ball. Keep your feet grounded and your eyes on the ball.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. What about my arms?<p class=message>For serving, keep your arms straight and hit the ball with the heel of your hand. And remember to follow through!<p class="message sent">Wow, there's a lot to think about. But you make it sound so simple!<p class=message>It is simple, B. Just take it one step at a time. Now, let's see you try to hit it over the net.<p class="message sent">Here goes nothing! *whoops* Sorry, coach. That wasn't so great.<p class=message>No worries, B. That's why we're practicing! Try again, and this time, bend your knees slightly before you jump.<p class="message sent">*concentrating* *hits the ball successfully* Yes! I did it!<p class=message>Great job, B! You're a natural. But don't get too cocky now-- we still have a long way to go!<p class="message sent">Haha, I won't! Thanks for the great tips, coach. I'm excited to keep practicing and see how we can improve.<p class=message>You got it, B. Remember, the sky's the limit!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=209b3ffc-dd92-4c81-bca5-c2497d1927ca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
