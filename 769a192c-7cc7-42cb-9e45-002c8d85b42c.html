Why do you ask?<p class=message>I just tried it for the first time yesterday and it blew my mind. The creaminess and saltiness of the dish were spot on!<p class="message sent">Yes, the combination of eggs, parmesan cheese, and pancetta just creates magic on the plate. Did you know that the original recipe from Rome doesn't use cream?<p class=message>Really? I had no idea. But you know what? I'm not exactly a fan of keeping tradition. I'll add a drizzle of cream the next time I make it.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That is totally up to you, A. There are no rules when it comes to food! But you should try the traditional recipe first before adding anything.<p class=message>You're right, I'll give it a try. But I can't help adding my own twist on things. I might even add some chili flakes for a little kick.<p class="message sent">Hmmm, that's interesting. It could work, but you have to be careful not to overpower the flavor. The dish has a delicate balance.<p class=message>I know what you mean. I don't want to mess up this classic dish. I'm sure it will still taste great even if I stick to the original recipe.<p class="message sent">Trust me, A, you will not regret it. And once you perfect it, you'll have a new go-to meal on your hands.<p class=message>I'll take your word for it. Thanks for the tip, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=76998f12-06ca-42cf-b277-85afe9df75a8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
