How's it going? Ready to brew some delicious South African beer?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm excited to learn more about the local flavors and ingredients.<p class=message>Well, we'll be using a lot of maize in this brew, which is a staple in many traditional South African dishes.<p class="message sent">Interesting! I've never used maize in beer before. What other ingredients are we working with?<p class=message>We'll be using a good amount of hops, as well as some unique spices like rooibos and buchu.<p class="message sent">Rooibos in beer? That's wild! I'm excited to see how this turns out.<p class=message>Yeah, it's definitely a departure from the traditional beer styles we're used to brewing. But that's what makes it exciting!<p class="message sent">So, what's the plan for today's brewing process?<p class=message>We're going to start by grinding up the maize and then boiling it with some water. While that's happening, we'll steep the buchu and rooibos in another pot.<p class="message sent">Got it. And then we'll add everything together and let it ferment for a while?<p class=message>Exactly! It's going to take a bit longer than our usual brews, so we'll need to be patient. But I think it'll be worth it in the end.<p class="message sent">I'm sure it will be! This is why I love being a brewer - you never stop learning and trying new things.<p class=message>That's right! There's always something new to discover in the beer world. And who knows, maybe we'll create the next big thing in South African brewing!<p class="message sent">Hey, you never know. Let's get to work and see what magic we can create.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=92fd745f-ff15-4ddd-adff-029448ea086d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
