How about your part?<p class=message>The front-end part is pretty much done. Just working on some minor tweaks.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I'm almost done with the back-end as well.<p class=message>Awesome! Can't wait to see the final outcome of our project.<p class="message sent">Me too. By the way, have you seen the new Star Wars trailer?<p class=message>Yeah, I did. I can't wait for the movie to come out.<p class="message sent">Same here, it looks really promising. Speaking of movies, have you seen any good ones lately?<p class=message>Actually, I watched the new Spider-Man movie and it was fantastic. You should check it out if you haven't yet.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendation. I'll definitely give it a watch.<p class=message>No problem. Hey, do you have any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Nothing much, I was thinking of going on a hike. How about you?<p class=message>I might catch up on some reading and try out some new recipes. Maybe we can share some later.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a good plan. I love cooking too. What kind of dishes do you like to make?<p class=message>I'm into healthy and easy-to-make meals. Often something with lots of avocado and veggies.<p class="message sent">That's cool, I've been trying to eat healthier too. Maybe you can give me some tips.<p class=message>Sure, I'd be happy to. Let's talk about it when we meet up on Monday.<p class="message sent">Sounds great. Let's nail this system development, so we can have more time to enjoy our hobbies!<p class=message>Yeah, let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=88bf8a35-2165-48b3-ab78-a8e34a3190a7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
