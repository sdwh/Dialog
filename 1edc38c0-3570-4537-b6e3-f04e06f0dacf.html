How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thank you for asking. Where can I take you today?<p class=message>I'm going to Hiroshima, could you take me there?<p class="message sent">Sure, no problem. What brings you to Hiroshima?<p class=message>I'm visiting my sister who lives there. I heard there are some great places to eat in the city. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely! If you're looking for some authentic Japanese cuisine, try Okonomimura. The food there is delicious.<p class=message>Sounds great, I can't wait to try it out. Have you ever been there?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's one of my favourite places to eat in Hiroshima.<p class=message>Awesome. By the way, have you ever had any unusual experiences with passengers?<p class="message sent">Well, one time I drove a celebrity to their hotel and they left their phone in my car. I had to chase them down and return it to them.<p class=message>That's funny! Did they give you a reward for returning the phone?<p class="message sent">No, they didn't. But it's all good, at least I got to say hi to them again.<p class=message>Haha, that's a cool story. Thanks for sharing it with me.<p class="message sent">No problem. We're almost there, Hiroshima is just around the corner.<p class=message>Thank you for the ride, it was a pleasure talking with you.<p class="message sent">Anytime, have a great day and enjoy your visit to Hiroshima!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1edc2a00-71ad-4dd9-b3d9-ac0898d9b4cc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
