Tell me more.<p class=message>Sure! Have you heard of a cheese called Brie de Meaux? It's a soft, creamy cheese that pairs really well with red wine.<p class="message sent">That sounds deliciously tempting. What about something for a white wine?<p class=message>Of course, for white wine, you can try Comté. It's a hard cheese that tastes nutty and sweet.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I've tried that before. Do you have any other recommendations?<p class=message>Yes, I also highly recommend Roquefort. It's a blue cheese that is perfect with sweet dessert wines.<p class="message sent">Sounds adventurous! Do you have any pairings with something heavy?<p class=message>Definitely, for heavy red wines, try Cantal. It's a semi-hard cheese that has a savory, earthy flavor.<p class="message sent">This is great, but how do we know it's authentic French cheese?<p class=message>Look for the AOC label, that stands for Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée, which is a certification that the cheese is authentic and made in France.<p class="message sent">I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have any personal favorites?<p class=message>Yes, I love Munster cheese, it has a strong smell but the taste is absolutely heavenly.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. Can I try some with a glass of red wine?<p class=message>Certainly! Let me put together a cheese platter for you.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. You sure know how to sell the cheeses.<p class=message>Salesmanship is never hard when it comes to French cheese and wine.
