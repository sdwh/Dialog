I heard they have amazing opportunities for international students.<p class=message>Yeah, I've been doing some research and there are a lot of great companies to work for.<p class="message sent">Do you know if you need any special visas or permits to work in Australia?<p class=message>I'm not exactly sure, but I think you need a work permit if you plan on working for more than six months.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. Do you know what the application process is like?<p class=message>From what I've seen, it's pretty straightforward. You just need a strong resume, a cover letter, and some references.<p class="message sent">That doesn't sound too bad. Do you have any recommendations for where to start looking for internships?<p class=message>Definitely check out websites like Indeed or Glassdoor. They have a lot of listings for internships in Australia.<p class="message sent">That's good to know! Have you thought about what industry you'd want to work in?<p class=message>I'm considering marketing or advertising, but I'm also open to other industries.<p class="message sent">Nice. I was thinking about environmental science or sustainability myself.<p class=message>Oh, that's really cool! I bet Australia has a lot of opportunities in that field.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of Australia, have you ever tried Vegemite?<p class=message>(laughs) Yes, I have. I'm not a huge fan though.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, it's definitely an acquired taste. Have you been to Australia before?<p class=message>Not yet, but it's definitely on my bucket list. How about you?<p class="message sent">Same! I really want to visit the Great Barrier Reef and see all the unique wildlife.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. Maybe we can plan a trip together once we both have our internships lined up!<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do that! And hey, we'll already have an Australain work permit, so that's a perk!<p class=message>(laughs) Absolutely. I can't wait!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ff408079-e1b7-40c9-a0bb-e66648fdbbc0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
