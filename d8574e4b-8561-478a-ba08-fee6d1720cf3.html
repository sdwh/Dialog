It's been a busy day, but good. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks for asking. So, I hear you want to talk about our publishing plan?<p class="message sent">Yes, I went through your manuscript and it's terrific. I think it has great potential!<p class=message>That's great to hear! What ideas do you have in mind for the publishing plan?<p class="message sent">Well, we can start with getting it edited and proofread. Then, we can pitch it to some literary agents and try to get it published by a big house.<p class=message>Sounds great! But what if that doesn't work out?<p class="message sent">Don't worry, we can always self-publish. You can get your name out there and maybe even have a bestseller on your hands.<p class=message>Self-publishing sounds like a daunting task. Do you have any tips?<p class="message sent">Sure! Make sure you have a great cover and blurb. Hire an editor and formatter. And most importantly, market the heck out of it!<p class=message>Thanks for the great advice. I'm excited to get started on this publishing journey.<p class="message sent">Me too! Let's get this book on the shelves!<p class=message>Before that, we might want to think about an audiobook version. I've always had a voice that could melt butter.<p class="message sent">(laughs) A, you crack me up! We can definitely look into that too.<p class=message>Great! I think this could be the start of a beautiful partnership.<p class="message sent">Agreed, A. Let's work together to make this book a success!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d855e8eb-165e-4845-8f7f-0b14ab75b25d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
