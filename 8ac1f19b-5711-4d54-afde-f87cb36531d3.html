I'm the pastry chef here. What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm the tea master. I think we should start with some green tea, don't you?<p class=message>Absolutely! Our Bi Luo Chun is a popular choice. Would you like to pair it with any of our pastries?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about the Osmanthus cake? I think that would be a nice match.<p class=message>That's a great choice. It's one of my favorites too. Would you like me to heat it up a bit?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. And while you're doing that, can you tell me about your favorite tea?<p class=message>Of course! I love our Tie Guan Yin. Its floral aroma and smooth taste make it a perfect afternoon tea.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! I would love to try it. For my guests, I usually recommend our Mango Green Tea. It's a sweet and refreshing drink that pairs well with many of our desserts.<p class=message>That's a great suggestion. Have you tried our Red Bean Mooncake? It's a traditional Chinese pastry that's perfect for autumn.<p class="message sent">I haven't, but it sounds delicious! I think I'll have to try one with my tea. And speaking of autumn, have you started preparing for the Mid-Autumn Festival?<p class=message>Absolutely! It's one of the busiest times of the year for me. I've already started making mooncakes and preparing other festival treats.<p class="message sent">It sounds like you're going to be very busy. I'm looking forward to trying some of your creations.<p class=message>Thanks! I hope you enjoy them. Oh, and have you tried our Rose Black tea? It's a great option if you want something bold and flavorful.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But it sounds like it's definitely worth a try. Thank you for the recommendation!<p class=message>No problem. It's always great to share our tea and pastry expertise. I can't wait for you to try it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8abcdd51-7346-4a26-bf0e-a4637fd55ad0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
