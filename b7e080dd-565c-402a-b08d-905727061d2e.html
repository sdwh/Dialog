It's been slow, but that's how fishing goes sometimes.<p class=message>Yeah, I hear you. Speaking of fish, do you know any good spots around here to get some fresh seafood?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, my restaurant serves the freshest catch around. What are you in the mood for?<p class=message>I'm looking for something light and refreshing, maybe some grilled shrimp or fish.<p class="message sent">We have some delicious grilled shrimp and a catch of the day that I think you'll love.<p class=message>Sounds great! How do you prepare the catch of the day?<p class="message sent">We lightly season it with herbs and grill it to perfection. It's simple, but it really lets the freshness shine through.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. Do you serve it with any sides or sauces?<p class="message sent">We offer some dipping sauces on the side, but I'd recommend trying it with our fresh market vegetables.<p class=message>That sounds healthy and delicious. When are your restaurant's busiest hours?<p class="message sent">We tend to get pretty busy during dinner time, but it's always good to make a reservation just in case.<p class=message>Good advice, thanks! I can't wait to try out your restaurant's fresh seafood.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. I hope you enjoy it and I look forward to seeing you soon!<p class=message>Thank you, see you soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b7dcd934-5bb8-4c73-8325-c99c38d00f74.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
