Where are you headed today?<p class=message>I'm on my way to Brisbane for a job interview. Have you ever been there before?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've been to Brisbane quite a few times. It's a great city, very underrated.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Any recommendations for places to check out while I'm there?<p class="message sent">Well, you've got to try the famous Ginger Beer at the XXXX Brewery. And of course, a visit to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary is a must.<p class=message>Those both sound like great suggestions. Have you ever held a koala?<p class="message sent">I have, and let me tell you, they are absolutely adorable. But be warned, they have sharp claws!<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. Do you have any favorite places to eat in Brisbane?<p class="message sent">If you're in the mood for seafood, you can't go wrong with Gambaro Seafood Restaurant. They have some of the freshest seafood I've ever tasted.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. Thanks for the tip! So, do you always drive taxis or do you have any other hobbies?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm actually an amateur DJ on the weekends. I love mixing music and seeing people dance.<p class=message>That's really cool! What kind of music do you typically play?<p class="message sent">I'm into a bit of everything, really. From electronic dance music to old school hip hop.<p class=message>I might have to catch one of your gigs sometime! We're almost at my destination. Thank you for the great conversation and the helpful suggestions.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! It was my pleasure. Good luck with your interview!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8dfb8235-7ae1-43ce-b729-6fb87ca2b3b4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
