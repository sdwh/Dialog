How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there, I work for a car rental company and I was wondering if you could help me understand the process for renting a car at this airport.<p class=message>Sure, I'd be happy to help. Assuming the reservation has been made in advance, the customer can simply take a shuttle to the rental car area, present their ID and reservation confirmation, and they'll be on their way.<p class="message sent">That sounds pretty straightforward. Do you find that most people make reservations in advance, or do they often just show up and hope for the best?<p class=message>I'd say it's about 50/50. However, we highly encourage customers to make reservations ahead of time to ensure availability and avoid any delays.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. And what about returning the car at the end of the rental period?<p class=message>It's just as easy. Upon arrival, customers park the car in the designated area and return the keys to the rental desk. We'll handle the rest.<p class="message sent">Great, thanks for the information. Do you have any recommendations for places to visit in the area?<p class=message>Of course! There are lots of great restaurants and attractions nearby. The beach is always a popular spot, and we also have a fantastic shopping mall just a few miles away.<p class="message sent">Well, I'm definitely planning to check out the beach while I'm here. Thanks for the tips!<p class=message>No problem at all. Have a great day, and let us know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2443fc8b-8824-48f8-a115-7cd1a6b3487f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
