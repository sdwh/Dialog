I'm looking to book a flight from New York to London.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, I'd be happy to assist you with that. When were you looking to travel?<p class=message>I'm thinking about flying out in the next two weeks.<p class="message sent">OK, let me just check our inventory. Ah, it looks like we have a few options at different price points. Would you like me to go over them with you?<p class=message>Yes, please.<p class="message sent">Well, we have a nonstop flight that leaves at 10 am and arrives in London at 8 pm. It's a bit on the pricey side though.<p class=message>Hmm, I'm not sure if I want to spend that much. What else do you have?<p class="message sent">We have another option that has a layover in Dublin but it's more affordable. It leaves at 6 am and arrives in London at 9 pm.<p class=message>That sounds good. How long is the layover?<p class="message sent">About 3 hours. You'll have enough time to grab a coffee and stretch your legs.<p class=message>Alright, that sounds like a good plan. Let's book that one.<p class="message sent">Excellent, I just need to get some information from you. What's your name and date of birth?<p class="message sent">Great, I'll just process your payment and then we'll send your e-ticket by email. Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>No, that's all. Thanks for your help.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Have a great flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=82a932b9-c5c0-4b02-8032-2b6b7f5dcf60.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
