Then, they trap the waste inside the system and transport it back to land for proper disposal.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's amazing! Do you think it will be effective in cleaning up the oceans?<p class=message>Absolutely! It's estimated that this technology can remove up to half of the plastic waste in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in just five years.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. But, what about the marine life? Will it be safe for them?<p class=message>Yes, it's designed in a way that doesn't harm any marine life. Plus, the system also collects data on the ocean's plastic concentration, which can lead to better policies and practices in the future.<p class="message sent">That's great news! I hope more technologies like this will be developed in the future.<p class=message>Definitely, it's important for us to take care of our oceans and the life within them.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, have you heard about biodegradable packaging materials?<p class=message>Yes, I have. They're made of materials that can naturally break down over time, unlike traditional plastic that takes hundreds of years to decompose.<p class="message sent">That's right. It's also a great way to reduce plastic waste and pollution.<p class=message>Exactly! It's important for us to educate ourselves and others on ways to reduce our plastic footprint on the planet.<p class="message sent">I agree. Every little effort counts in making a difference.<p class=message>Well said. It all starts with small changes we can make in our daily lives.<p class="message sent">That's true. Let's do our part in protecting our oceans and the environment.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=51b49de4-502f-49cd-9b76-983edc9ad2b2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
