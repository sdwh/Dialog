Are you excited to learn how to make local Fukuoka cuisine and grilled fish?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A! I've always been fascinated by the different food and flavors from different regions in Japan.<p class=message>That's great to hear! So, first on the agenda is Hakata-style ramen. Have you ever tried it before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I'm excited to learn how to make it from scratch.<p class=message>Well, it's definitely a challenge, but with practice and patience, you'll get the hang of it.<p class="message sent">I'm up for the challenge! What else is on the menu for today?<p class=message>We'll also be making mentaiko, which is a spicy cod roe seasoning commonly used in Fukuoka cuisine, and grilled saba fish.<p class="message sent">Yum! I love saba. What's the secret to making it perfect?<p class=message>The key is to marinate it in a mix of soy sauce, sake, and ginger before grilling it to bring out its natural flavors.<p class="message sent">Noted. This is going to be a delicious and educational day!<p class=message>It sure is. And since it's your first time in Fukuoka, I recommend you try some local specialty foods, like motsunabe and mentaiko-flavored snacks.<p class="message sent">I'm all up for trying new things! Thanks for the suggestions.<p class=message>No problem. Oh, and don't forget to try some Hakata sake too. It's famous for its smooth and light flavors.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I can't wait to feast and explore the city!<p class=message>Me too. Let's get started on our cooking lesson and then do some sightseeing later.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'm ready to learn, cook, and eat!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2ccf521e-8a5a-46bd-bd3c-0bdf3552214e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
