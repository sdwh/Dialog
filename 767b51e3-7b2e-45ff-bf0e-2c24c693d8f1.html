How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. So, have you been driving a taxi for a long time?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been driving for almost a decade now. It's a good job and helps me pay the bills.<p class=message>That's interesting. Do you ever get bored driving around the same areas all day?<p class="message sent">Actually, no. It's always different. The scenery changes, and different people get in the car. It keeps things fresh.<p class=message>I see what you mean. So, what's the most interesting thing you've experienced while driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">Hmm, there have been a few. One time, a customer left their baby in the back seat. I had to track them down and return the baby safely.<p class=message>Oh wow! That must have been scary. You're a hero!<p class="message sent">Haha, thanks. It was definitely an adventure. So, what brings you to Kaohsiung city?<p class=message>I'm here on vacation with my family. We're planning to visit the night markets and enjoy some local food. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Ah, I highly recommend the Liuhe Night Market. It's the biggest and the most famous night market in Kaohsiung.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. Do you have a favorite food from there?<p class="message sent">Yes! The grilled squid is my personal favorite. You have to try it.<p class=message>Okay, I will definitely do that. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class="message sent">No problem. Enjoy your stay in Kaohsiung.<p class=message>Thank you. You have a good day!<p class="message sent">You too, take care.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=767897b9-6fb0-47c2-ad59-6ddfe9b9bb9f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
