I heard you're the AI guy in this self-driving car project.<p class="message sent">Hey, that's right. Nice to meet you. So, what's your role in this?<p class=message>I'm a software engineer. We're in the same boat, I guess.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'm assuming you've seen the mock-up designs for the car system?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. They look impressive. But how do we start building the AI system?<p class="message sent">Well, we have to start with the sensors first. Then, we can integrate the control algorithms, mapping software, and finally, the user interface.<p class=message>Okay, sensors. We need cameras, radar, LIDAR, and GPS?<p class="message sent">Exactly. Then, for control, we'll use a combination of Kalman filters and an extended Kalman filter.<p class=message>Got it. And for the mapping software, we can use a mix of SLAM and probabilistic approaches?<p class="message sent">You've got it. And for the user interface, we want to keep it simple, so drivers can understand the self-driving modes.<p class=message>Yes, I couldn't agree more. We need a lot of testing, debugging, and calibration, right?<p class="message sent">You're speaking my language now. We have to test the frequency responses and calibrate all the sensors correctly, so the algorithms can make good decisions.<p class=message>Yes, testing and calibration are critical. We also need to ensure the safety of our passengers.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. The safety of our passengers is a top priority. We have to account for all possible edge cases.<p class=message>Do you think we need to create a rule-base framework to handle edge cases?<p class="message sent">We could, but I think we can use deep learning to recognize complex situations and make appropriate decisions.<p class=message>You're right. Deep learning can handle all sorts of edge cases effectively. I think we should also develop a neural network that can recognize road signs and traffic signals.<p class="message sent">Yes, that would be a significant step forward. We can also use data from other cars on the road to boost the recognition accuracy.<p class=message>Awesome, I'm really excited about this project. We can change the world with this kind of self-driving car tech.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Together, we can make significant contributions to the field and create something truly revolutionary.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d15f669e-126f-486e-8fa5-98e4e3e5ebd8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
