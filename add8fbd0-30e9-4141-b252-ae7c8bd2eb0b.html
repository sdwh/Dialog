Can I start you off with some wine or champagne?<p class="message sent">Good evening. Absolutely, we would love some champagne to start our meal.<p class=message>Excellent choice! We have some of the best champagne in the region. Our most popular champagne is the Blanc de Blancs.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. We would also like your recommendation on the best dish to go with it.<p class=message>Great! Our chef's special is the pan-seared tuna with a side of risotto. It pairs perfectly with the champagne.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious. We'll definitely give that a try. Can you also tell us more about the winery and its history?<p class=message>Of course! The winery was founded in the early 1800s by a French family. They started producing champagne using traditional methods and became one of the most respected wineries in the region.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. How about some red wine to go with our main course?<p class=message>Sure thing. We have a few options to choose from such as the Château d’Epiré Savennières, Château d’Anglès Château Laffitte-Teston, and Château Larrivet Haut-Brion.<p class="message sent">We'll take the Château d’Anglès Château Laffitte-Teston, please. Can you also recommend a dish to pair with it?<p class=message>Yes, our steak frites is a classic French dish that pairs perfectly with red wine.<p class="message sent">Perfect! We'll take two. Thank you.<p class=message>You're welcome! While you're waiting, feel free to take a stroll in our garden and enjoy a glass of champagne under the stars.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea - thank you for the suggestion. We're really looking forward to the meal.<p class=message>It's my pleasure to make your dining experience memorable. Enjoy!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=add8f96e-c054-4813-b620-fdf1fbd8d71d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
