I'm so excited to explore this famous fish market. I've heard so much about the fresh seafood here.<p class="message sent">Yes, this is one of the largest fish markets in the world. It's always bustling with activity and has a great reputation for high-quality fish.<p class=message>That's awesome! I'm a fisherman myself, so I'm excited to see all the different types of fish and how they're prepared.<p class="message sent">Great, let's start our tour with the tuna auction. It's the most popular attraction here.<p class=message>Wow, that's amazing! I've never seen a fish auction before. When can we watch it in action?<p class="message sent">The auction starts early in the morning, around 5 AM. But we can still see the auction area and learn about the process.<p class=message>Sounds perfect! I'm sure there's a lot that goes into auctioning off a fish that's worth thousands of dollars.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Now, let's move on to the different stalls and see what kind of seafood we can find. Do you have any favorites?<p class=message>I love shrimp, crab, and lobster. But I'm open to trying new things too.<p class="message sent">As a guide, I always recommend trying the seasonal fish. They're usually the freshest and best-tasting.<p class=message>That's a great tip! I'm excited to try something new. How do I know which fish to pick?<p class="message sent">Look for clear eyes, bright red gills, and shiny skin. Those are signs of a healthy and fresh fish.<p class=message>Got it. And what about the different grades of fish?<p class="message sent">The highest grade is usually the most expensive, but it also has the best quality. It's up to you to decide what's worth the price.<p class=message>I see. I'll definitely keep that in mind. Thank you so much for showing me around and teaching me all about choosing the best seafood.<p class="message sent">No problem, glad to help! Don't forget to sample some sushi and sashimi while you're here. It's a must-try at the Tsukiji Market.<p class=message>Absolutely! I can't wait to taste the freshest sushi and sashimi in the world. What an amazing experience!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a6a7374d-f2f1-4c0f-9d44-1bfc2c271144.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
