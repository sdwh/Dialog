There's a trap right ahead.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. You always have my back. You know, sometimes I think you're more of a magician than a wizard.<p class=message>(laughs) I think you mean a magician, B. And I like to think of myself as a little bit of both.<p class="message sent">(grinning) Well, you certainly have a way of making those fireballs look effortless. I could use some of your magic in battle though.<p class=message>(smiling) You don't need magic, B. Your sword skills are impressive. Plus, I can always provide a little extra oomph when needed.<p class="message sent">(nodding) That's true. We make a pretty good team, don't we?<p class=message>(agreeing) Absolutely. Although, I have to say, I could use a little break from all this underground exploration. How about we take a minute to catch our breath and enjoy the view?<p class="message sent">(looking around) I agree, this is a pretty impressive dungeon. Who knew that rickety old door was hiding all of this?<p class=message>(chuckling) That's the charm of adventuring, B. You never know what you're going to find. Speaking of which, I think I see a chest over there.<p class="message sent">(eagerly) Let's go check it out!<p class=message>(warning) Hold on, B. You know what happened the last time we rushed into things...<p class="message sent">(sheepishly) Yeah, yeah, I remember. Maybe we should approach with caution this time.<p class=message>(grinning) Now that's the kind of strategy I like to hear. Let's go get our loot!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=850ea262-2ffd-42f0-9501-7b5f88088b88.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
