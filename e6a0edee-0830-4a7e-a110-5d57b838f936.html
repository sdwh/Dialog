What brings you here to the library today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I am working on a research report for my academic writing class. How about you?<p class=message>I'm looking for some reference books to teach my literature class next week.<p class="message sent">That's great. Maybe you can help me with my research report. I'm struggling a little bit with finding adequate sources.<p class=message>Of course, I would love to help. What's your report topic?<p class="message sent">It's about the impact of social media on mental health.<p class=message>Oh, that's an interesting topic. Have you checked out any academic journals or databases yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I found a few articles on JSTOR, but I'm having trouble narrowing down my focus.<p class=message>Well, it's important to stay focused on your thesis statement. Perhaps we can brainstorm some ideas together?<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. Maybe we could start by discussing the positive and negative effects of social media on mental health.<p class=message>Absolutely. Firstly, social media can provide a sense of community and support. However, it can also lead to unrealistic expectations and cyberbullying.<p class="message sent">Yes, those are excellent points. I think I have a better idea of how to structure my report now.<p class=message>I'm glad to help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your assistance. You're a great teacher and I appreciate your help.<p class=message>Anytime, happy researching!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e6a0637f-78de-425e-8505-559af0995763.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
