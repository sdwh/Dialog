How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm doing well. Excited to be interning here!<p class=message>We're glad to have you. So, have you had a chance to take a look at our research projects yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. The projects seem very interesting, especially the one about drones and their behavior.<p class=message>Ah, yes. That's my project. I'm trying to understand how drones communicate with each other.<p class="message sent">That's cool! So, how are you planning to gather data?<p class=message>Well, I have a few drones set up to fly around and observe them, but it's difficult to get close without disrupting their communication.<p class="message sent">Have you tried disguising yourself as a drone?<p class=message>(laughs) That would be funny, but I don't think that would work. Plus, drones are more technologically advanced these days.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You're probably right. Maybe we can try a stealth approach in observation.<p class=message>Hmm, that's not a bad idea. And we can attach a small camera to the drones to get a better picture of what's happening.<p class="message sent">Yes, that could be a good way to not disturb them and still gather data.<p class=message>Great idea, B! I'll definitely look into that. Thanks for your input.<p class="message sent">Of course, happy to help!<p class=message>By the way, have you had a chance to go to the coffee shop down the street? They have the best lattes.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't been there yet. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class=message>No problem. It's a great place to take a break and recharge.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. I'll check it out during my lunch break.<p class=message>Okay, let us know how it is. Anyway, back to work. We have a lot of data to collect.<p class="message sent">Got it. Let's get to it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ff6fac2-8546-4b44-b031-977670d1dcb2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
