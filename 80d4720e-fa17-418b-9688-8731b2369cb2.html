It's always busy but everyone is so friendly.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What kind of food do you recommend for first-time customers?<p class="message sent">I think the bibimbap is a popular choice. It has a variety of flavors and textures, and it's also easy to customize.<p class=message>That's a good one. What about the kimchi stew? It's my personal favorite.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, the kimchi stew is delicious too. But be warned, it can be pretty spicy!<p class=message>(laughs) I can handle the heat. Speaking of heat, how's the kitchen temperature today?<p class="message sent">It's actually cooler than usual. I guess the air conditioning is finally working properly.<p class=message>That's a relief. I hate sweating while cooking.<p class="message sent">Me too. By the way, have you seen the new sushi rolls we're offering?<p class=message>No, not yet. Are they fusion-style with Korean ingredients?<p class="message sent">Yes, exactly. They have bulgogi and pickled daikon in them. You should try them out.<p class=message>Definitely. I can't resist sushi with a twist. (pauses) Hey, B, do you know any good Korean puns?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think... How about this one? Why was the noodle soup so expensive? Because it was bowlsamyeon.<p class=message>(laughs) Oh man, that's a good one. I'll have to remember that.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=80d26be4-9ea5-48a4-ab94-c00b8cef147a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
