How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. Hey, I've been reading up on some recent network attacks. Have you heard about the IoT botnet?<p class="message sent">Of course. It's insane how they can use insecure devices to launch such massive DDoS attacks.<p class=message>Definitely. And it's not just IoT devices, but also unpatched software that's vulnerable to attacks.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's why I always advise users to keep their software up-to-date and implement strong passwords.<p class=message>Good point. Speaking of software, have you ever used a fuzzer tool for analyzing vulnerabilities?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I find that fuzzing is a great way to identify weaknesses in software and improve its security.<p class=message>That's interesting. How long does the fuzzing process usually take?<p class="message sent">It really depends on the complexity of the software and how many inputs it takes. But generally, it can take a few minutes to a few hours.<p class=message>Hmm, okay. Do you have any other recommendations for improving network security?<p class="message sent">Always practice good cyber hygiene, like not clicking on suspicious links and keeping your antivirus software up-to-date.<p class=message>That's great advice. Thanks for chatting with me about this stuff.<p class="message sent">Anytime. It's always good to exchange ideas and learn from each other in the industry.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a5cd59e5-db25-4d43-978d-01fd0792ec63.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
