So, we're here to discuss how to design a modern enterprise website. Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Hi A! Yes, I have a few ideas that I think might work. Have you seen the latest trend of using more illustrations on websites?<p class=message>Yes! I was just thinking that could be something we incorporate into the design. Do you have a specific illustration style in mind?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of using more hand-drawn illustrations as they add a personal touch to the website. What about using animations to engage visitors on the website?<p class=message>Sounds great! Animations can definitely make the website more dynamic and interactive. How about the color scheme?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of using a more monochromatic color scheme with pops of color to add some visual interest. What do you think?<p class=message>That's a good idea. It will make the website look cohesive and professional. Speaking of professionalism, we should also prioritize the usability and functionality of the website.<p class="message sent">Definitely. The user experience should be intuitive and easy to navigate. Also, we can make sure the website is mobile-friendly.<p class=message>Great point. That is very important nowadays. Do you think we should incorporate any social media features?<p class="message sent">Yes, integrating social media is important to allow users to interact and share content. We can also add a live chat feature for customer support.<p class=message>These are great ideas B! I'm excited to start working on the design. Should we schedule a follow-up meeting to go over the progress?<p class="message sent">Sounds good! Let's do it in a few days once we have some initial designs ready.<p class=message>Perfect! It's been great catching up with you and I look forward to collaborating on this project.<p class="message sent">Likewise A! Let's create something amazing together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2b75168c-c0c2-4d04-a85c-fa47e75e2795.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
