I'm A, your barista today. What can I get for you?<p class="message sent">Hi A! Nice to meet you. I'm B, the roaster. I'd like to try your café con leche - I've heard it's a hot item here.<p class=message>Great choice! We take our café con leche seriously here. Would you like to learn how to make it too?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'd love to learn from the experts. What's your secret?<p class=message>Well, the key is a strong espresso shot and steamed milk. But it's all in the ratio - 1:1 for the perfect balance.<p class="message sent">Fascinating! Do you manually steam the milk or use a machine?<p class=message>We use a steaming wand to create that creamy texture. It takes a bit of practice to get it perfect, but it's worth it.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a labor of love. Do you have any other tips for a beginner like me, A?<p class=message>Definitely! Make sure your espresso is fresh and use cold milk straight from the fridge. And don't forget to tap the steaming pitcher on the counter to eliminate air bubbles.<p class="message sent">Wow, I'm learning so much. Can I practice making one myself?<p class=message>Of course! I'll guide you every step of the way. Here's the pitcher and the espresso machine. Let's get started.<p class="message sent">(after steaming the milk) How's this, A? Did I nail the microfoam?<p class=message>Impressive, B! Your latte art could use some work, but the microfoam is spot on. Seems like you're a natural.<p class="message sent">Ha! I have you to thank for that, A. This is delicious. Can't wait to try it with my own coffee beans.<p class=message>That's music to my ears. Nothing makes me happier than sharing my coffee knowledge with fellow enthusiasts. Cheers, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=41c0d8b0-d36d-4dc6-8816-284d0d74609d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
