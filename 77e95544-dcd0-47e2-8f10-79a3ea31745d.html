Your writing is always so captivating!<p class=message>Thanks, it means a lot coming from you! Did you have any feedback?<p class="message sent">Not much, really. I just had a few minor suggestions for tweaking some of the dialogue.<p class=message>That's fair, I'm always open to suggestions. What else did you notice?<p class="message sent">Well, I think we should consider cutting the scene with the talking cat. It's a bit too... out there, you know?<p class=message>(laughs) But that's what makes it fun! You can't deny the entertainment value of a chatty feline.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I suppose you're right. But we want to make sure the story stays grounded in reality, too.<p class=message>Absolutely. I appreciate your input.<p class="message sent">Of course, that's what I'm here for. You know, sometimes I think being a book editor is more like being an archaeologist - we have to unearth the hidden gems buried within the pages!<p class=message>(laughs) I couldn't have said it better myself. But I think I'll leave the excavation to you!<p class="message sent">Ha! Well, it's a good thing I'm up for the challenge. Let's make this book the best it can be!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=77e93a63-b68f-46bc-b3e5-11b91253d157.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
