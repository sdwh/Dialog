Can I get your recommendation for a famous Swiss alcoholic drink?<p class="message sent">Of course! How about Absinthe? It's a traditional Swiss drink that's quite popular.<p class=message>Absinthe sounds intriguing. What's the story behind it?<p class="message sent">Well, it's made with wormwood and other herbs. It's said to have hallucinogenic properties, so it was banned in several countries for a time.<p class=message>Oh wow, that's interesting. Let's give it a try!<p class="message sent">Great choice. I'll prepare it for you now.<p class=message>Do people typically drink Absinthe straight or is there a specific way to enjoy it?<p class="message sent">Traditionally, it's served with a sugar cube on a slotted spoon over the glass, and ice-cold water is dripped over it to dilute it.<p class=message>That's good to know. I feel fancy just hearing about it.<p class="message sent">It's definitely an acquired taste, but many people love it. So, how's the drink? What do you think?<p class=message>Wow, it's strong but smooth! I can see why it's famous. What other Swiss drinks do you recommend?<p class="message sent">If you like sweet drinks, I recommend Kirsch, a cherry-flavored liqueur. Or for something less strong, there's Rivella, a popular Swiss soda.<p class=message>I appreciate the suggestions. This has been a great experience. Thank you!<p class="message sent">You're very welcome. It was a pleasure serving you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3fe5ae0e-f113-4967-a30f-d75d486e6a23.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
