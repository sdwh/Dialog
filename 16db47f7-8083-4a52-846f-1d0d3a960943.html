What's going on?<p class="message sent">Not much, just waiting for my interrogation with the police.<p class=message>Ah, yes. I heard you have a bit of a run-in with the law?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I guess I got caught red-handed this time.<p class=message>Well, it happens to the best of us. What exactly did you do?<p class="message sent">Honestly, it's not that serious. Just a little shoplifting.<p class=message>Shoplifting? You do realize stealing is against the law, right?<p class="message sent">Of course, I know that. But, I couldn't help myself when I saw that shiny new gadget on the shelf.<p class=message>Well, you're going to have to face the consequences for your actions now.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know. I just hope I don't end up in jail.<p class=message>Don't worry too much. If you're honest with the police and do your best to make things right, you might just get away with a warning.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the encouragement. It's nice to have someone on my side.<p class=message>No problem. Just remember, crime doesn't pay!<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm starting to realize that now.<p class=message>And, if you ever find yourself in a tough spot again, just remember to ask for help instead of turning to crime.<p class="message sent">I will definitely keep that in mind. Thanks for your words of wisdom.<p class=message>Anytime. Now, let's hope for the best and hope the police aren't too hard on you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=16d79e9f-8875-4f17-9202-bc679b61a42b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
