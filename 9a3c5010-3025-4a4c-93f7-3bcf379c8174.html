I've been reading up on it and I think it's important for our company to implement it.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Do you have any tips for getting started with the implementation process?<p class=message>Well, first we need to conduct a risk assessment to identify any potential vulnerabilities.<p class="message sent">Ah, makes sense. And then we can develop a plan to address those vulnerabilities.<p class=message>Yes, that's right. We also need to train all employees on the policies and procedures associated with ISO 27001.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of work. But I guess it's worth it to protect our company's information.<p class=message>Definitely. And it's not just about protecting our data, it's about maintaining our customers' trust.<p class="message sent">Good point. So, what are some of the specific procedures we'll need to implement?<p class=message>Well, for starters, we'll need to ensure that all workstations have updated antivirus software and firewalls.<p class="message sent">And we'll need to have measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, right?<p class=message>Yes, exactly. We'll also need to regularly review and update our security policies as technology and threats evolve.<p class="message sent">This is all really helpful. Thanks for bringing it up, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. It's important for us to stay informed and proactive about security. Plus, I like geeking out about this stuff.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, I can tell. But seriously, I appreciate your knowledge and initiative.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9a3bd00f-2ad8-4cf3-87b6-75758bada56e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
