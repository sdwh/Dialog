What's up?<p class="message sent">Hey A! Not much, just working on the latest desktop game concept. Want to check it out?<p class=message>Absolutely! I'd love to see what you've been cooking up.<p class="message sent">So, it's a game where players have to design their own theme park, complete with rides and attractions.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun! Can we have a roller coaster that goes upside down?<p class="message sent">Of course! That's the beauty of this game - the player gets to create their own perfect park.<p class=message>I love it. What other features are there?<p class="message sent">Players can also hire staff to run the park and improve their ratings. And there are different scenarios and challenges to keep things interesting.<p class=message>Wow, I can't wait to try it out. When do you think it will be ready?<p class="message sent">We're aiming for a few months from now, but we'll keep you updated. In the meantime, any other ideas or suggestions for the game?<p class=message>Hmm, maybe we could have a mini-game where players have to clean up the park after a storm?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! It adds a realism factor and a challenge for the players. Thanks, A!<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. I can't wait to play the finished product.<p class="message sent">Same here, thanks for your input. Let's catch up again soon and continue brainstorming.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a2eb94d9-48b3-48c4-bcea-ba28b51d6c19.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
