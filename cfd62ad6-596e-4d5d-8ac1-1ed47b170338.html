How is the service going tonight?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! It's going pretty well, thank you. How are you feeling about dinner service tonight?<p class=message>I'm feeling pretty confident. I have some new dishes on the menu that I'm excited to try out.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! What are some of the highlights?<p class=message>Well, we have a new salmon dish with a honey and mustard glaze, and a sweet potato mash as a side.<p class="message sent">Yum, sounds delicious! What else is new?<p class=message>We also have a vegetarian option, a portobello mushroom risotto with truffle oil.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing! I'm sure it will be a hit.<p class=message>I hope so. How's everything going with the customers so far?<p class="message sent">So far so good, everyone seems to be happy with their meals. And they're really enjoying the wine pairing recommendations.<p class=message>That's music to my ears. I always feel like we've done a good job when the customers are happy.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Speaking of wine, I have a couple of questions about the bottles we're offering tonight. Can you help me out?<p class=message>Of course, B! What do you need to know?<p class="message sent">Can you recommend a good red wine to pair with the salmon dish?<p class=message>I would suggest a pinot noir, perhaps from France or California. It would complement the flavors of the salmon nicely.<p class="message sent">Perfect, thank you! And what about a white wine to pair with the mushroom risotto?<p class=message>A chardonnay would be a good choice, particularly one with some oak aging. It would help bring out the richness of the truffle oil.<p class="message sent">Wonderful, thank you so much for your help!<p class=message>Always happy to assist, B. Let's keep up the great work tonight and make sure our customers have a memorable dining experience.<p class="message sent">Agreed, let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cfd3ec92-5c17-4181-85b6-98e61165e06e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
