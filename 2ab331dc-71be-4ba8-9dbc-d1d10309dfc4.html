Nice to meet you, the network security engineer.<p class="message sent">Hi, nice to meet you too. So, what have you been working on recently?<p class=message>Well, I'm trying to ensure maximum network security for our company. We can't afford to let hackers take advantage of any vulnerability in our system.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's essential to have adequate security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to our company's network data.<p class=message>Exactly. I have been upgrading our firewalls and intrusion prevention systems to better protect against cyberattacks and unauthorized access.<p class="message sent">That's great news. But have you considered conducting regular penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in our network?<p class=message>Yes, that's a great idea. In fact, I have scheduled an external penetration testing to be conducted next month.<p class="message sent">Excellent, prevention is better than cure when it comes to network security. We don't want to suffer from a data breach.<p class=message>Absolutely. In addition, I have also been educating our employees to be more aware of cybersecurity threats and potential phishing scams.<p class="message sent">That's crucial. Human error is the most common cause of data breaches. It's important to raise awareness among employees and keep them informed of the latest threats and scams.<p class=message>Indeed. I'm glad I have your support on this. Together, we can effectively protect our company's network from potential cyberattacks.<p class="message sent">Couldn't have said it better myself. It's always better to work together and share knowledge and best practices to ensure the highest level of network security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2aaef296-b4a5-4720-a24e-d223ea5bf35f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
