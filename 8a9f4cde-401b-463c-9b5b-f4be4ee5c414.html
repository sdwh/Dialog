Can you help me pick out a style?<p class="message sent">Sure! Do you have any preference in mind?<p class=message>Not really, I'm open to different options. Maybe something trendy but not too extravagant.<p class="message sent">Well, our slim-fit suits are very popular among younger customers. They are modern and fit well.<p class=message>Hmm, that does sound appealing. Can I see some samples?<p class="message sent">Of course, please follow me. Here we have some gray, navy, and black options. They are made of high-quality material and come in different sizes.<p class=message>Great! I think gray would be my friend's favorite color. What about accessories?<p class="message sent">You can complete the look with a white dress shirt, a tie or bow-tie, and a pocket square. It all depends on the formality of the event and your friend's personal style.<p class=message>I see. Maybe a classic white shirt and a black bow-tie would be a safe choice. Can you also recommend some shoes?<p class="message sent">Definitely. These black leather shoes are a timeless option, but we also have more colorful or textured ones if you want to add some flair.<p class=message>Wow, I didn't know there were so many details to consider. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">No problem! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you need alterations. We want you to be satisfied with your purchase.<p class=message>That's very kind of you. I appreciate it. I hope my friend will like the suit too!<p class="message sent">I'm sure he will. You have great taste. Don't forget to take advantage of our discount if you buy a full set.<p class=message>Oh, right. Thank you for reminding me. I'll definitely consider it. Have a nice day!<p class="message sent">You too. Good luck with the wedding!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8a9e4d01-425c-466a-b8eb-1d7a16e11751.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
