Just working on some system security upgrades.<p class=message>That sounds important. Anything interesting happening in the server room lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, yeah. We had a rogue access point broadcasting on our network last week.<p class=message>Yikes, that's not good. Did you track it down?<p class="message sent">Yeah, luckily it was a pretty old device and we were able to track it down and eliminate it.<p class=message>Good work. Have you ever dealt with a major security breach before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, unfortunately we had a phishing attack that compromised some employee information a few years ago. It was a huge headache.<p class=message>I can imagine. It seems like cyber threats are always evolving.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, it's a constant battle to stay ahead of the bad guys. But that's what makes it so challenging and interesting.<p class=message>Do you have any advice for our users to protect themselves?<p class="message sent">Sure, the basics like strong passwords and not clicking on links from unknown sources are always important. And keeping software up to date too.<p class=message>Thanks for the tips. I'll make sure to share them with our team.<p class="message sent">No problem. It's all about staying vigilant and being proactive about security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f1107117-59ff-4aaa-84e1-554502d9f151.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
