How's business going today?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! It's going pretty well, thanks. I just got a fresh batch of tuna in this morning.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Did you get a chance to inspect the quality of the fish before purchasing them?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I always make sure to check for any potential spoilage or damage before bringing them to the market.<p class=message>That's very responsible of you. Have you ever thought about getting a certification for the quality of your fish to attract more buyers?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. But I'm not quite sure how to go about getting certified.<p class=message>Well, there are several organizations that offer certifications for fish quality, such as the Marine Stewardship Council and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. Thanks for the tip. Do you think getting certified could help me get a better price for my fish?<p class=message>Definitely. Customers are willing to pay more for certified fish because it ensures that the fish has been responsibly sourced and of high quality.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. I'll have to look into getting certified. Thanks for the suggestion, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. It's always good to strive for a higher quality of fish to offer your customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=771f0ab7-c9ce-4d2f-9dd6-01c4fce5ebd9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
