What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent message-content">Hello! I’ve been craving some good Chicago-style deep dish pizza, what would you recommend?<p class="message received message-content">Definitely our signature pizza, the “Meat Lovers”! It’s loaded with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, and ham. It’s a fan favorite!<p class="message sent message-content">Yum, that sounds delicious! And what about drinks?<p class="message received message-content">We have a great selection of local craft beers, if you’re interested. Or we have soda, lemonade, and iced tea as well.<p class="message sent message-content">I think I’ll go with a classic Coke, and I’d like to add some mushrooms and onions to the Meat Lovers pizza please.<p class="message received message-content">Great choice! And would you like any appetizers to start?<p class="message sent message-content">How about some garlic knots and mozzarella sticks?<p class="message received message-content">Sounds perfect. I’ll put that in for you. So, are you from out of town?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I’m here on a business trip, but I’ve always heard great things about deep dish pizza so I had to try it out.<p class="message received message-content">Well I hope you enjoy it! Chicago is definitely known for its pizza.<p class="message sent message-content">Thank you, I can’t wait! So, have you always worked at this restaurant?<p class="message received message-content">This is actually my first job, but I’ve really enjoyed working here so far. The people are great and the food is amazing.<p class="message sent message-content">That’s great to hear! Maybe you’ll have to give me some recommendations for other places to try while I’m here.<p class="message received message-content">Of course! There are plenty of great restaurants and attractions in the area. And speaking of attractions, have you had a chance to see any of the sights yet?<p class="message sent message-content">Not yet, but I’m hoping to catch a Cubs game before I leave.<p class="message received message-content">Oh, nice! Are you a big baseball fan?<p class="message sent message-content">I am, and I’ve heard great things about Wrigley Field. I’m really looking forward to it.<p class="message received message-content">You’ll love it! Let me know how it goes. And speaking of which, your pizza and appetizers are ready. Enjoy!<p class="message sent message-content">Thank you so much! Everything looks and smells amazing. I can’t wait to dig in!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=09065f4f-0b57-460a-9391-2219b87b7ef4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
