How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Nurse A. I'm feeling much better, thanks for asking.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I see that you have a new prescription. Have you been taking your medication as directed?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. But I'm a little confused about the dosage.<p class=message>No problem, let's go over it together. How many pills are you supposed to take at once?<p class="message sent">I think it's two pills, three times a day.<p class=message>That's correct. So you'll take a total of six pills throughout the day. You can take them with or without food, but make sure to drink plenty of water.<p class="message sent">Got it. And what if I miss a dose?<p class=message>It's best to take your medication as close to the scheduled time as possible. But if you do forget, just take your next dose at the regular time. Don't take more than the recommended amount.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll make sure to keep that in mind. Thank you, Nurse A.<p class=message>You're welcome, B. And don't hesitate to call or come see me if you have any more questions. We want to make sure you're on the road to a full recovery!<p class="message sent">Thank you, Nurse A. You've been very helpful.<p class=message>No problem, it's all part of the job. Take care now!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3c5f2ce7-13bd-4559-be78-9b58a2e9ed23.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
