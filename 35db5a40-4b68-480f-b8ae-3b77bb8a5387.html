Everything's looking good so far.<p class=message>Great to hear! I was wondering, have you heard the one about the programmer who went to the bar?<p class="message sent">No, what's the punchline?<p class=message>He just wanted to raise a toast to functional programming!<p class="message sent">Haha, that's terrible. But you know, speaking of programming jokes, have you heard the one about the SQL query that walks into a bar?<p class=message>No, do tell.<p class="message sent">The SQL query asks the bartender for a JOIN, and the bartender replies, 'You're barred!'<p class=message>Nicely done, B. Speaking of SQL, do you have any tips on optimizing database queries? I'm running into some performance issues.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. One simple optimization is to use indexes to speed up queries. Also, try to write your queries in a way that minimizes the amount of data being fetched.<p class=message>Thanks, I'll definitely keep that in mind. By the way, have you tried any new tools or plugins lately that you'd recommend?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I just started using this VSCode plugin that auto-formats my code on save. It's been a game changer for me.<p class=message>Sounds awesome. I'll have to check it out myself. You know, B, it's always great talking shop with you. Why don't we grab a beer after work and keep the conversation going?<p class="message sent">I'm up for it! Let's make it happen.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=35d9cbb9-ed46-4881-8b00-2bcb0833a4f0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
