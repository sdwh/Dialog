But honestly, the term incident response sounds like we're talking about firefighters.<p class=message>Haha, true. Maybe they should call it cyber firefighters.<p class="message sent">Yeah, but cyber criminals would just laugh at them.<p class=message>I know right, it's like giving them a free pass for finding weak spots.<p class="message sent">And did you know that ISO 27001 focuses on the adage “prevention is better than cure”?<p class=message>Wow, so it's like getting a vaccine for your IT systems.<p class="message sent">Exactly, A. It's important to be proactive and prevent cyber attacks before they happen.<p class=message>Yeah, but what if something still goes wrong?<p class="message sent">Well, with ISO 27001, you have a well-maintained incident response plan just in case of emergencies.<p class=message>Like a superhero in standby mode, waiting to save the day.<p class="message sent">More like having a safety net for your IT systems.<p class=message>Right, I get you. It's like, even if you make a mistake, ISO 27001 has got your back.<p class="message sent">And who wouldn't want that kind of support in these challenging times?<p class=message>Yeah, it's like having a buddy to save you when you stumble.<p class="message sent">That's why ISO 27001 is the best player in the game for ensuring data security.<p class=message>Alright, I'm sold. I'll keep ISO 27001 Incident Response in mind.<p class="message sent">Good idea, A.
