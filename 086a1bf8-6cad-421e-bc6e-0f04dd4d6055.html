What's the benefit of implementing it?<p class=message>Well, it helps organizations to protect their sensitive information and mitigate security risks.<p class="message sent">That definitely sounds like something worth looking into. How does one go about implementing it?<p class=message>There are a number of steps to take, such as performing a risk assessment, establishing policies and procedures, and implementing controls to mitigate identified risks.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a lot of work. Is it worth it?<p class=message>Absolutely. Not only does it provide valuable protection for sensitive information, it also demonstrates to customers that the organization takes information security seriously.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Do you know of any organizations that have implemented it successfully?<p class=message>Yes, I've heard that IBM, Microsoft, and HP have all successfully implemented the ISO 27001 standard.<p class="message sent">Wow, those are some big names. They must take security pretty seriously.<p class=message>Definitely. It's becoming more and more important as technology advances and cyber-threats become more prevalent.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I can imagine. I think I might take a closer look at this ISO 27001 standard. Thanks for introducing me to it!<p class=message>No problem, happy to help.
