What’s on your mind?<p class=message>Well, I was hoping to get your thoughts on the overall cost.<p class="message sent">In terms of development time, labor costs, or additional expenses?<p class=message>All of the above. The quoted price seemed a bit steep to me.<p class="message sent">Hmmm, I see your point, but keep in mind that this is a complex project that requires a lot of resources.<p class=message>I hear you, but is there any room for negotiation? Maybe we can find a way to trim costs without sacrificing quality.<p class="message sent">It’s possible. Let me get back to you with my ideas after taking a closer look at the numbers.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I’ll be waiting eagerly for your feedback.<p class="message sent">Sure, just don’t expect me to work miracles overnight!<p class=message>Ha! No worries, I know you’re good, but not that good.<p class="message sent">Ouch! That hurt my ego a bit.<p class=message>Haha, sorry about that. I’m just trying to keep the mood light.<p class="message sent">I appreciate that. It’s nice to have a partner who doesn’t take things too seriously all the time.<p class=message>Likewise. So, besides the cost, did you notice anything else that’s worth bringing up in the contract?<p class="message sent">Actually, now that you mention it, there’s a clause about liability that seems a bit ambiguous. I think we need to clarify that with the vendor.<p class=message>Hmm, you’re right. Let’s make sure everything is crystal clear to avoid any potential misunderstandings.<p class="message sent">Agreed. The last thing we want is to end up in the middle of legal trouble.<p class=message>That’s for sure. Well, let’s get on with it then. I’ll schedule a meeting with the vendor and review everything with them.<p class="message sent">Great, and don’t forget to bring some snacks to sweeten the deal!<p class=message>Haha, you know me too well.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=54bfecea-ef12-4b5e-85e5-640a7dbd0150.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
