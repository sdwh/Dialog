How's everyone feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, teacher! I'm feeling great today!<p class=message>That's great to hear, B! So, today we're going to learn about idioms. Do you know what an idiom is?<p class="message sent">Yes, I think I do. It's a phrase that doesn't mean what it looks like, right?<p class=message>Excellent! That's right. Now, can you give me an example of an idiom?<p class="message sent">Sure! "Break a leg" means good luck, right?<p class=message>Yes, exactly! Give yourself a pat on the back. You've got it! Can anyone else give me an idiom?<p class=message>Wow, you guys are good. Looks like we're going to have a fun class today.<p class=message>Of course, D. What's on your mind?<p class=message>That's a great question, D. It means when you're feeling too shy or nervous to speak. Now, can anyone guess why the phrase "cat got your tongue" is used?<p class=message>That's a very good guess, E. The phrase may come from the idea that silence is often associated with cats.<p class=message>Thank you, F. I'm glad you're enjoying it. It's always fun to learn something new, especially with idioms. Now, let's get back to our lesson. Can anyone give me another idiom?<p class=message>Yes, G! You're doing a great job today. Keep it up, everyone!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c7b62bc2-f8ca-4e50-8e28-2c48fd6a669a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
