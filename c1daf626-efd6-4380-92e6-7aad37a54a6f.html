What kind of puzzles are you thinking of incorporating into the game?<p class="message sent">Hi A, great to have you onboard. I was thinking of image and code-based puzzles, and maybe even a few riddles.<p class=message>Sounds interesting! I can definitely help with coding puzzles. And I'm sure we can come up with some fun image puzzles as well.<p class="message sent">Perfect. And for the riddles, we could always turn to the classics for inspiration. What do you think?<p class=message>I think that's a great idea. Everyone loves a good brain teaser. So, what's the goal of the game? Are players trying to escape a room or solve a mystery?<p class="message sent">Yes, either one could work. I'm leaning towards a mystery theme. We could have the player be a private detective trying to solve a case.<p class=message>Awesome. That gives us a lot of room for creativity. We could incorporate clues that lead to different suspects and maybe even throw in some hidden objects for extra challenge.<p class="message sent">Exactly! And we could add a leaderboard for players to compete for the quickest solving time.<p class=message>Yes! The competitive aspect will definitely make the game more engaging. What do you think about adding a time limit for each level?<p class="message sent">I like that. It'll add to the pressure and increase the thrill of solving the puzzles. This game is going to be great!<p class=message>Agreed. Let's get to work and make it happen. I can't wait to see the final result.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c1d272da-5323-4c1e-a900-ad420cb6c5c2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
