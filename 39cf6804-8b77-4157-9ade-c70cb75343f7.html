Have you decided what you would like to eat tonight?<p class=message>Well, we have some great options, such as kangaroo steaks or barramundi. Both are very popular among our customers.<p class=message>Our mashed sweet potatoes and grilled asparagus are great options. They complement the flavour of the kangaroo perfectly.<p class="message sent">Excuse me, A? Can I make a suggestion? How about we add some bush tomato relish to the kangaroo steak? It's a native Australian ingredient and will enhance the flavour.<p class=message>That's a great idea, B! The bush tomato relish is very popular among our local customers.<p class=message>And for you, sir?<p class=message>Our roasted root vegetables and steamed greens are great options. They'll complement the fish's flavour really well.<p class="message sent">Hey, A? Can I make another suggestion? We could also add some lemon myrtle seasoning to the barramundi. It's a very Australian flavour and will add a bit of zing to the fish.<p class=message>Very true, B! Our customers love the lemon myrtle seasoning. Would you like that added to your barramundi, sir?<p class=message>Perfect, I'll go place your orders with the chef. In the meantime, would you like to try one of our signature Australian cocktails?<p class=message>Our wattleseed espresso martini is a favourite amongst our customers. It's made with native Australian wattleseeds for a unique flavour.<p class=message>Great choice! I'll have that prepared for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>It's my pleasure. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=39cf1a3c-9b46-4a8d-9492-7b2c52f7f152.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
