What are you up to today?<p class="message sent">Hi Mom! Just helping with some chores. There's so much to do around here.<p class=message>That's great. I was thinking we could tackle the garage today.<p class="message sent">Oh boy, sounds like fun! What's the plan?<p class=message>Well, first we need to clear out all the clutter. I'm sure we've got some things we can donate or sell.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been meaning to go through my old clothes and toys. Maybe we can have a yard sale.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We need to make some space for your dad's car too.<p class="message sent">Speaking of Dad, where is he today?<p class=message>He's out running some errands. Said he needed a break from all the cleaning we've been doing.<p class="message sent">Ha! Can't blame him. It's hard work.<p class=message>You're telling me! But it's worth it to have a clean and organized house.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Hey, do you remember that time we found that old photo album in the garage?<p class=message>Oh, I sure do. We spent hours looking at all the pictures and laughing.<p class="message sent">That was so much fun. Maybe we'll find some more treasures today.<p class=message>Who knows? One man's trash is another man's treasure, right?<p class="message sent">Haha, exactly! Let's get to work, Mom. This garage won't clean itself!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b5307587-58a2-4c34-b3e4-6a932aa693fd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
