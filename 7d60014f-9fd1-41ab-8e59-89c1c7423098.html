Speaking of which, have you ever had any interesting passengers?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes. One time, I had a couple who insisted on singing karaoke in the car. It was quite the experience!<p class=message>Haha, that sounds like a fun ride. Do you have any favorite destinations in Japan?<p class="message sent">For me, it has to be Kyoto.
