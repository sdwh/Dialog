You mean those snails? No, I haven't dared to try them yet. Have you?<p class=message>Oh yeah, I actually had them the other day at a fancy French restaurant. They were surprisingly delicious.<p class="message sent">Really? What do they taste like?<p class=message>They have this buttery and garlic flavor, and the texture is like a tender piece of meat. But of course, it takes some getting used to.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not sure if I'm ready for that kind of adventure yet. Maybe I'll stick to my comfort food.<p class=message>Hey, no judgment here! Comfort food is the best. But you should at least give escargot a chance someday, you might be surprised.<p class="message sent">Well, who knows? Maybe one day I'll be feeling adventurous and I'll give it a shot. But for now, I'm happy with my burger and fries.<p class=message>Hey, speaking of fries, have you had poutine before? It's a Canadian dish with fries, cheese curds, and gravy.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I've tried it before! That's definitely my kind of comfort food.<p class=message>Same here, it's so good. And I bet there are some places that serve escargot with poutine.<p class="message sent">Escargot with poutine? I don't know if I'm ready for that kind of fusion cuisine yet.<p class=message>Come on, live a little! Who knows, it might be the next big food trend.<p class="message sent">Well, if it means trying new things and having fun, count me in.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bb2b6d56-4266-4e4a-8c7f-0f94392903f8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
