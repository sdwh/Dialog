I'm making some desserts with my mom. She's teaching me how to bake today.<p class=message>That's great! What are you making?<p class="message sent">We're trying to make a pineapple cake. My mom says it's her favorite.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. Can I help you guys out?<p class="message sent">Sure! We're just mixing the batter right now. You can help us chop the pineapples.<p class=message>Alright, let me grab a knife. So, how long have you and your mom been baking together?<p class="message sent">We started a few months ago. It's one of the ways we bond and spend time together.<p class=message>That's nice. I wish I could bake with my mom too, but she's not really into baking.<p class="message sent">Maybe you can teach her! It's really fun, and you get to eat your creations afterwards.<p class=message>That's a good idea. So, how's the batter coming along?<p class="message sent">It's looking good! We just need to add some pineapples and put it in the oven.<p class=message>Sounds easy enough. Can I taste a bit of the batter?<p class="message sent">Go ahead! But don't spoil your appetite, the cake will be ready soon.<p class=message>Mmmm, this is really good. I think you guys have a talent for baking.<p class="message sent">Thank you! We're still beginners though. We're just doing it for fun.<p class=message>Well, keep it up! Who knows, you might open up your own bakery someday.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's a dream. But for now, we're just happy making cakes at home.<p class=message>And that's what matters. Enjoy your baking, guys!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! We will.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=88ee9620-6d90-434b-9b8d-2513059dc9c9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
