They're quite an interesting couple.<p class=message>Yes, they are. Apparently, they're very picky and have a lot of specific requests.<p class="message sent">Well, that's not too surprising. Buying a house is a big decision, after all.<p class=message>That's true. But I heard they're also very thorough in their inspections.<p class="message sent">Really? Well, I guess they want to make sure they're getting their money's worth.<p class=message>Exactly. They even brought along their own measuring tape and level to check things like the walls and floors.<p class="message sent">Wow, sounds like they're not messing around. But I hope they don't get too carried away and start drilling holes in the walls.<p class=message>Ha! That would be quite a sight. But I think the real estate agent might have something to say about that.<p class="message sent">Speaking of the agent, have you met them yet?<p class=message>Yes, I have. They seem really nice and knowledgeable about the area.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. Hopefully, they can find the couple their dream home.<p class=message>I hope so too. I imagine it must be quite tiring going from house to house, trying to find the perfect one.<p class="message sent">Oh, absolutely. But it's also exciting. You never know what you'll find.<p class=message>That's true. I just hope the couple doesn't get too attached to one particular house and end up getting their hearts broken.<p class="message sent">Well, fingers crossed they find the perfect house soon. And who knows, maybe we'll be invited over for a housewarming party!<p class=message>(laughs) That would be great. But I think we'll have to get in line behind the couple's parents and siblings.<p class="message sent">Fair enough. Let's just hope they have a big enough backyard for everyone!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8346188d-ae0d-4147-a3bf-fd41b212b89c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
