This is my first live show in months, it feels good to be back on stage.<p class=message>That's awesome! So, what kind of jokes do you have in store for us tonight?<p class="message sent">Well, I've got some good ones about my love life, my family, and of course, the current state of the world.<p class=message>Ha! That sounds great. I bet we could all use a laugh right now.<p class="message sent">Definitely! I'm always looking for the funny side of things. I mean, even when times are tough, you have to find the humor in the situation.<p class=message>That's a good point. So, how do you come up with your jokes?<p class="message sent">I get inspiration from my daily life, my observations, and sometimes, even the weird dreams I have at night.<p class=message>Oh wow, that's interesting. Have you ever been told that your jokes are too silly or inappropriate?<p class="message sent">A few times, but I think you just have to find the right audience. Plus, I like to think of myself as a master of self-deprecation.<p class=message>I see what you mean. So, do you have any big gigs coming up soon?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have a few lined up in different cities, but I'm also working on some new material for my next open mic night.<p class=message>Well, I'm definitely going to keep an eye out for your name. You're hilarious!<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, that means a lot coming from you. It's always great to have a supportive audience like you. Let's get this show started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=05a0e83e-22bd-4b3a-b867-154f3b340792.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
