Sure, I'm happy to help. Can I have your flight information?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, I'm flying from Taipei to Bangkok next week, and I believe my flight is with Thai Airways.<p class="message sent message-content">Great, let me check. Yes, I see your booking here. You're on Flight TG650, departing at 9:45 am on Wednesday.<p class="message received message-content">That's the one! Thank you. Do you know if the in-flight entertainment is any good?<p class="message sent message-content">Well, let's just say you won't be bored! They have a great selection of movies and TV shows. Is this your first time on Thai Airways?<p class="message received message-content">Yep, it is! I heard their food is pretty good too.<p class="message sent message-content">Oh yes, definitely. I always look forward to the meals on their flights. Any special meal requests for you?<p class="message received message-content">No, just the regular meal is fine. But I do have one more question about baggage allowance.<p class="message sent message-content">Of course, go ahead.<p class="message received message-content">I'm planning on bringing an extra suitcase, is that allowed?<p class="message sent message-content">Sure, you can purchase extra baggage allowances online or at the airport. Just make sure you don't exceed the weight limit.<p class="message received message-content">Got it, thank you for your help. I'm looking forward to this trip!<p class="message sent message-content">You're welcome, have a great flight and enjoy Bangkok!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0c0af4d8-27a6-436e-990e-095342a472c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
