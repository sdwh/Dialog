Welcome to our little barbecue joint. I'm so excited to see what kind of beer you have for us to pair with our food!<p class="message sent">Hey A! I'm glad to be here. I brought some locally crafted beer that I think will really complement your barbecue. Have you tried any of the IPAs from the brewery down the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What kind of flavors are we looking at?<p class="message sent">Well, they've got a grapefruit and citrus one that's perfect for cutting through the rich flavors of your meat. And then they've got a hoppy one that's going to really bring out the smokiness.<p class=message>Wow, I'm definitely intrigued. And I see you brought some beer glasses too. That's a nice touch!<p class="message sent">Absolutely, presentation is key. Speaking of which, how do you present your barbecue?<p class=message>We keep it simple, just a big platter on the table with all the meat and sides. We let the food speak for itself.<p class="message sent">I like that. Keeping it casual and focused on the flavors. Let's put our heads together and come up with some kind of special collaboration.<p class=message>I'm thinking a barbecue sandwich with some of your hoppy beer as a marinade for the pork. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. And for the sides, what about some beer-battered onion rings?<p class=message>Perfect. It's settled. A barbecue sandwich with beer-marinated pork and beer-battered onion rings. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!<p class="message sent">Me too. Let's get cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3dd416bb-1d41-4dfc-87d9-8b0f783b6358.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
