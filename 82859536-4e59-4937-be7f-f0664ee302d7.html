Welcome to our little corner of Japan in Shanghai.<p class="message sent">Thank you very much. I've heard great things about this place and I'm excited to try some of your sushi and sake.<p class=message>You've come to the right place. We take pride in the quality of our sushi and only use the freshest ingredients.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. I'm particularly fond of tuna and yellowtail. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>For tuna, I recommend our akami or bluefin tuna. It's very popular among our customers. And for yellowtail, our hamachi is a must-try.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious. And what about sake? I'm not very familiar with the different types.<p class=message>We have a wide variety of sake with different flavor profiles. If you're looking for something light and crisp, I suggest trying our ginjo sake.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll give that a try. So how long have you been a sushi chef?<p class=message>I've been making sushi for over a decade now. It's a very meticulous and challenging job, but I find it very fulfilling.<p class="message sent">It definitely requires a lot of skill and precision. Have you ever made any funny mistakes while making sushi?<p class=message>Oh yes, there was this one time when I accidentally flipped a piece of sushi and it landed on the customer's plate upside down. We both had a good laugh about it.<p class="message sent">Haha, that must have been quite an experience. And do you have any funny stories related to sake?<p class=message>Well, one time a customer drank a little too much sake and started singing Japanese karaoke. It was quite the performance!<p class="message sent">That sounds like a fun night. Well, thank you for the great food and hospitality. I'll be coming back soon for sure.<p class=message>It was my pleasure. We look forward to seeing you again soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8284dd36-7176-4464-a163-7296d7f09152.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
