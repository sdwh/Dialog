It's a standard for Information Security Management Systems, right?<p class=message>Yup, that's correct. I'm actually considering getting certified in it.<p class="message sent">Really? That's impressive. Any idea what the certification requirements are?<p class=message>Well, you need to have a good understanding of risk management and security controls.<p class="message sent">That sounds difficult. Have you started studying yet?<p class=message>Yeah, I'm taking an online course right now. It's pretty engaging actually.<p class="message sent">Haha, you and your geeky online courses. But in all seriousness, it's great that you're taking it seriously.<p class=message>Thanks, I'm really excited to learn more about data protection and compliance requirements.<p class="message sent">It's so important for companies these days, especially with all the data breaches happening.<p class=message>Exactly. Speaking of data breaches, did you hear about the one at Equifax?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's crazy how much personal information was stolen. That's why we need ISO 27001.<p class=message>Yes, and it's not just for companies. It can also apply to individuals who want to better protect their sensitive information.<p class="message sent">I didn't know that! Maybe I should look into it too.<p class=message>Definitely! It's always better to be safe than sorry. Plus, it's impressive to have ISO 27001 certification on your resume.<p class="message sent">You're right. I might just sign up for that online course too. It sounds pretty interesting after all.<p class=message>Awesome, we can study together and geek out over information security!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d7a30068-ba5a-43d8-b332-ef4b7e96b111.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
