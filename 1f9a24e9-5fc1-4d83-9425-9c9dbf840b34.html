How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing pretty good as well, thanks. So I wanted to talk to you about the testing process we're using right now.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. What specifically did you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, I was wondering if there are any automated testing tools that we could use to speed up the process?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We could use tools like Selenium or Appium to automate some of the repetitive tasks.<p class=message>Oh wow, those sound interesting. Could you tell me more about them?<p class="message sent">Sure. Selenium is a framework that allows us to write automated tests for web applications, while Appium is specifically for mobile applications.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. I assume they integrate well with our current testing environment?<p class="message sent">Yes, they should integrate fairly easily. We can work on setting them up together if you'd like.<p class=message>That would be great. I'm really looking forward to seeing how much faster we can test using these tools.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And they'll also help reduce the chances of human error during testing.<p class=message>Brilliant. How long do you think it'll take to get them up and running?<p class="message sent">It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe a couple of days at most.<p class=message>Alright, well let's get started then. Thank you so much for your help with this B.<p class="message sent">No problem. I'm always happy to help improve our testing process.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f963431-627c-4317-9c8f-e16a5eac2fd8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
