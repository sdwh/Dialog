I've been swamped with all these client requests lately.<p class="message sent">Hey A, doing alright. Client requests can be overwhelming, but it's part of the job!<p class=message>Yeah, I know. But with so many requests coming in, our server can't handle it all efficiently. What do you suggest we do?<p class="message sent">Hmm, have you considered load balancing? It distributes the client requests across multiple servers, so our system won't be overloaded.<p class=message>That's a good idea. But won't it take up a lot of space and slow down the system even more?<p class="message sent">Not necessarily. Load balancing can actually improve the speed and reliability of our system.<p class=message>Really? I didn't know that. How does it work exactly?<p class="message sent">It prioritizes client requests based on the server's current workload. The server with the lightest load will handle the request, ensuring that all requests get processed at optimal speed.<p class=message>Ah, I see. That makes sense. Thanks for explaining it to me!<p class="message sent">No problem. It's important to have a well-functioning system to keep clients happy, after all.<p class=message>Speaking of keeping clients happy, have you heard about that new update for our app?<p class="message sent">Yep, I have. It's supposed to be a huge improvement. Can't wait to see it in action!<p class=message>Same! It's been a while since we've had a major update like this.<p class="message sent">I'm hoping it'll make our job easier too. Less complaints means less work for us, right?<p class=message>Haha, you're not wrong there. Let's hope for the best!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5aa599b4-bdfb-4e2b-8b45-d3ebde56abe4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
