How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, how about you?<p class=message>Doing alright. I was just curious, what do you think is the most interesting project you've worked on using Ruby on rails?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough one. I would say the e-commerce platform we built for a small business last year. It was challenging, but also really rewarding to see it all come together.<p class=message>That sounds cool! I've mostly worked on building APIs using RoR.<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. APIs are super important for allowing different systems to communicate with each other.<p class=message>Definitely. Have you had any funny experiences while coding?<p class="message sent">Oh man, I remember spending hours trying to figure out why my code wasn't working, only to realize I had left out a single semicolon.<p class=message>Haha, that's the worst. My least favorite thing is when I accidentally delete a chunk of code and don't have it saved anywhere else.<p class="message sent">Ugh, yeah. Auto-save has saved me from losing work so many times.<p class=message>Speaking of saving work, have you ever collaborated with a designer or front-end developer on a project?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's always interesting to see how their work affects the functionality of the back-end.<p class=message>Definitely. It's important to have good communication between all team members.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of communication, do you have any fun plans for the weekend?<p class=message>Not yet, but I was thinking about maybe trying out that new Asian fusion restaurant we've been hearing about. Want to come with?<p class="message sent">Sounds great! Let's plan on it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=41caaf90-f3a0-4aa6-95e2-ee8edf7acb5a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
