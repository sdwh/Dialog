Nice to meet you, B! I'm excited to learn how to cook some delicious seafood dishes.<p class="message sent">Hi A, it's great to have you here! Tasmania is known for its fresh seafood, and we're going to teach you how to cook some traditional recipes with locally caught fish and shellfish today.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! What are we going to cook first?<p class="message sent">We'll start with grilled octopus. We catch them fresh right here, so they couldn't be fresher!<p class=message>Grilled octopus? That sounds interesting. Do we need any special tools?<p class="message sent">Just a good set of tongs and a grill. We'll marinate the octopus in olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice before grilling for a tender and delicious result.<p class=message>I can't wait! What's next on the menu?<p class="message sent">We'll move on to some Tasmanian salmon cakes. The salmon is freshly caught and paired with potatoes, herbs, and spices. It's a simple yet delicious recipe.<p class=message>Yum! That sounds so good. What else are we going to cook?<p class="message sent">We'll also make a seafood chowder with mussels, prawns, and fish. It's a hearty and comforting dish that's perfect for any day of the year.<p class=message>That's great! I'm already getting hungry just hearing about it.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, we'll have plenty for you to try. And if we have time, we can also make some beer-battered fish and chips.<p class=message>Oh, I love fish and chips! This is going to be such a fun and delicious class.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more, A. Let's get started and see what we can cook up!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3a80234f-692b-4afe-a947-be6f55327f82.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
