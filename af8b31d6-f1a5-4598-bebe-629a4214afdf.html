Welcome to our farm. My name is John. Are you here for the fruit picking?<p class="message sent">Hi John, yes, I am! It's my first time doing this. I'm excited to try it out.<p class=message>That's great to hear! We have a variety of fruits today. Apples, pears, and peaches are in season right now. Which one would you like to pick first?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'll go with peaches. They look delicious!<p class=message>Good choice. Just be careful not to squish them while picking. You want to choose the ones that are firm, but not too hard.<p class="message sent">Got it. This is harder than it looks. How do you make it look so easy?<p class=message>Years of experience, my friend. Plus, it helps to have a good eye for spotting the ripest fruits.<p class="message sent">I can definitely see that. Do you have any tips for me to improve my picking skills?<p class=message>Sure thing. Always use two hands when picking so you don't accidentally drop the fruit. And if you have trouble reaching, use a ladder or our picker tool.<p class="message sent">Great advice. Thanks, John. What do you do with all the leftover fruits that don't get picked?<p class=message>We usually sell them to local businesses or donate them to food banks. We don't like to waste anything here on the farm.<p class="message sent">That's really cool. It's good to know that your farm supports the community.<p class=message>Absolutely. We're proud to be a part of the local agriculture industry. Hey, look over there! You missed a peach!<p class="message sent">Oops, my bad. Thanks for spotting that, John. This is definitely a lot of work, but it's also really fun.<p class=message>I'm glad you're enjoying it. It's hard work but it's also rewarding to know that you're picking the freshest fruit. Oh, and one more thing. Don't forget to try our homemade apple cider. It's the best around!<p class="message sent">You read my mind. I was just about to ask if you had any drinks to cool off with. Thanks again, John. This has been a great experience.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=af84d1f8-c988-42b0-ba15-56d74b32275b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
