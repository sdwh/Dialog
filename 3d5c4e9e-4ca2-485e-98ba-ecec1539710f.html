What have you been up to lately?<p class="message sent">Not much, just been learning a lot about sustainable fishing.<p class=message>Really? That's cool. What's that all about?<p class="message sent">Well, you know how we love eating seafood. But with overfishing and other issues, the oceans are being seriously damaged.<p class=message>Yeah, I've heard about that. So what's the solution?<p class="message sent">Sustainable fishing practices, like using nets with smaller holes so only mature fish can be caught and limiting the amount that can be caught in a certain area.<p class=message>That makes sense. But does it affect the fishing industry?<p class="message sent">Sure, it means that there might be fewer fisherman employed, but in the long-run it will benefit everyone.<p class=message>Makes sense. Are there any other ways to help with sustainability?<p class="message sent">Definitely! Something as simple as choosing to buy seafood that's sustainably sourced can make a difference.<p class=message>That's really interesting. I'll have to start paying more attention to where my seafood comes from.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It may seem like a small thing, but every little bit counts.<p class=message>It's great to know that there are ways for us to still enjoy seafood while being environmentally responsible.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And who knows, maybe sustainable fishing practices will inspire other industries to be more sustainable too.<p class=message>I hope so. We need to take care of our planet now more than ever.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It starts with small changes like this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3d5732e5-023e-415d-b4f5-a431d2f0e4f0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
