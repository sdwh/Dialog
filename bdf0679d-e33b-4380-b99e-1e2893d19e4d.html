There's this place called "Betty's Burgers" that's pretty popular.<p class=message>Hmm, what makes it so popular?<p class="message sent">Well, they use all fresh ingredients and their burgers are cooked to perfection. Plus, their fries are amazing!<p class=message>Sounds good, but do they have any unique burger options?<p class="message sent">Actually, they do have a vegan burger option that is supposed to be really tasty.<p class=message>That's great to hear! I'm always on the lookout for good vegan options. Is there another place you'd recommend?<p class="message sent">Yes! Have you heard of "Grill'd"?<p class=message>No, tell me about it.<p class="message sent">They focus on healthy burgers made with organic, grass-fed meat. They even have a veggie patty option too.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a good balance between indulging and healthy eating.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Plus, they have really fun toppings like avocado and beetroot.<p class=message>Yum, now I'm getting hungry. Are these places only in Sydney, or are they all over Australia?<p class="message sent">I think "Betty's Burgers" is located in multiple cities across Australia, but "Grill'd" is mainly in the major cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane.<p class=message>Good to know, thanks for the recommendations! I'm definitely going to check them out next time I'm in Australia.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bde734b7-b92e-4322-b34f-9982ec3f709b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
