How about yours?<p class=message>Pretty good, I've been working on the design for our social media website.<p class="message sent">That's great, I've been working on the backend functionality. Have you thought about how we're going to handle image uploads?<p class=message>Yeah, I was thinking about using a third-party library for that. We could also set up a CDN to make sure our images load quickly.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I've also been thinking about how we're going to handle user authentication and authorization.<p class=message>Yeah, that's definitely something we need to plan carefully. I was thinking we could use OAuth2 to authenticate with third-party services like Google or Facebook.<p class="message sent">That's a good point, but we also need to make sure our own authentication system is solid. I was thinking about using JWT tokens.<p class=message>JWT tokens are a good idea. It's also important to make sure we handle password storage and encryption correctly.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We should use a hashing algorithm and maybe add some salt to the passwords.<p class=message>Agreed. Hey, have you heard about that new front-end framework that's been getting a lot of buzz lately?<p class="message sent">You mean Vue.js? Yeah, I've been hearing a lot about it. Have you tried it out yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm curious to see how it compares to React and Angular.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's always interesting to see how new technologies stack up against the old ones.<p class=message>For sure. Speaking of new technologies, have you seen any cool new back-end frameworks or libraries that we should check out?<p class="message sent">Actually, I've been hearing a lot about GraphQL lately. It's supposed to be really useful for building APIs.<p class=message>Oh yeah, I've heard of GraphQL. It's supposed to make it easier to fetch exactly the data you need from the server.<p class="message sent">That's right. I think it could be a good fit for our social media site.<p class=message>Sounds good. Let's plan on checking it out once we get our basic functionality working.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Hey, speaking of planning, have you thought about how we're going to handle QA and testing?<p class=message>Yeah, I was thinking we could set up some automated tests using something like Selenium or Cypress. We should also plan on manual testing to catch any edge cases.<p class="message sent">Good idea. It's always important to make sure our code is solid before we release it into the wild.<p class=message>Definitely. Well, looks like we've got a lot to do. Thanks for chatting, B.<p class="message sent">No problem. Let's get back to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d19b739a-bac1-4317-8436-90c9ef6e966e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
