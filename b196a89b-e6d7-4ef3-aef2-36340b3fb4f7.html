I went hiking in the Swiss mountains.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. Speaking of Swiss, we need to come up with a new menu for our high-end restaurant.<p class="message sent">I've got a few ideas already. How about we start with a classic fondue or raclette? Then move onto some grilled Swiss cheese sandwiches?<p class=message>Those both sound delicious! To add some local flair, we could also include rösti, which is a traditional Swiss potato dish.<p class="message sent">Great idea, A. And for the main course, I was thinking we could do a roasted Swiss salmon with a side of alpine herb salad.<p class=message>Yum, that will definitely impress our customers. And for dessert, we could do a chocolate fondue with fresh fruit and marshmallows.<p class="message sent">I love it. We can also do a classic Swiss cookie called Basler Läckerli, which is made with honey and spices.<p class=message>Yes, and we can also showcase some of Switzerland's famous chocolates like Lindt or Toblerone.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'm looking forward to getting started on this menu with you, A.<p class=message>Same here, B. Let's not forget to pair these dishes with some of Switzerland's best wines and beers.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Our customers will definitely be in for a treat.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b18e95eb-e137-4fa8-9b84-d2548afe0ec2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
