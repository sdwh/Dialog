Thank you for taking the time to meet with us today.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. I'm always happy to speak with the press.<p class=message>So, with the recent election results, can you tell us your thoughts on the outcome?<p class="message sent">Well, as you know, it wasn't the result I was hoping for. But as I always say, democracy must prevail and I will work with the newly-elected officials to move our country forward.<p class=message>That's a great attitude to have. On a lighter note, we heard that you have a hidden talent. Care to share it with our audience?<p class="message sent">(chuckles) Ah, I don't know if it's much of a talent, but I do enjoy singing in my free time.<p class=message>Really? What kind of songs do you like to sing?<p class="message sent">Mostly old jazz standards, like "Fly Me to the Moon" and "My Funny Valentine."<p class=message>Well, maybe we can convince you to give us a little performance at the next press conference! (laughs)<p class="message sent">(laughs) We'll see about that, A.<p class=message>Alright, one more question before we go. What advice would you give to young people who are interested in getting into politics?<p class="message sent">My advice would be to always stay true to your values and beliefs, even if they're not the popular opinion. And never forget that you are there to serve the people, not yourself.<p class=message>Wise words indeed. Thank you so much for your time, Mr. Politician.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It was a pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=300a3b75-33f1-4e4d-b204-61913e793b50.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
