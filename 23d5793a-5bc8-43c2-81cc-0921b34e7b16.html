Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I was reading about it and it seems like implementing good security practices can actually be beneficial for businesses in the long run.<p class="message sent">That's true, but it can also be hard to know where to start. Do you have any ideas?<p class=message>One thing I read is that companies can use a risk management approach to identify potential vulnerabilities and then take steps to mitigate them.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. It's kind of like wearing a seatbelt in a car - you hope you never need it, but it's better to have it just in case.<p class=message>Exactly! And with ISO 27001, companies can also get certified to show their customers that they take security seriously.<p class="message sent">I like the sound of that. Maybe we could even make a game out of it - like, "who can find the most security risks in the office?"<p class=message>Haha, that's a great idea! We could have prizes for the winners, like a gift card or something.<p class="message sent">See, who says security can't be fun? Let's get started on our scavenger hunt.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=23d502c2-4683-47ef-bfe7-6cf811f1790f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
