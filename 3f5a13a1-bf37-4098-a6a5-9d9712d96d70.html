My name’s A, and I’m headed to Delhi for a business meeting. How are you today?<p class="message sent">I’m doing great, thanks for asking. It’s a beautiful day outside, isn’t it?<p class=message>Yes, it is. I’m glad that it’s not raining like it was yesterday.<p class="message sent">Yeah, the rain can be pretty tough on the traffic here. But I’m used to it. Have you ever been to Delhi before?<p class=message>No, it’s my first time. I’m excited to explore the city and try the local cuisine.<p class="message sent">Oh, you’re in for a treat! Delhi has amazing street food, especially the chaat and kebabs.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. By the way, your car is very clean and comfortable. Do you take good care of it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. I’ve been a taxi driver for over 10 years, and I know that a well-maintained car helps me provide better service to my customers.<p class=message>That’s smart. Speaking of which, how long do you think it will take to get to Delhi?<p class="message sent">It depends on the traffic, but normally it takes about 5 hours from here. But don’t worry, I’ll make sure we get there safely and on time.<p class=message>I appreciate that. Do you listen to music while you drive?<p class="message sent">Of course! Music helps me stay calm and focused on the road. Would you like to hear some Indian music?<p class=message>Sure, why not? I’d love to learn more about the local culture.<p class="message sent">Great! I’ll put on some Bollywood hits for you. If you like them, I can recommend some Indian movies for you to watch during your stay.<p class=message>That sounds like a fun way to pass the time. Thank you, driver. You’re a helpful assistant.<p class="message sent">It’s my pleasure, A. It’s always nice to have a pleasant conversation with my passengers. We’ll be in Delhi before you know it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3f51bb90-af29-49b2-b5aa-2734bd0a9b46.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
