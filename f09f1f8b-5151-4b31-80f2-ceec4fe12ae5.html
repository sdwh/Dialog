How about yourself?<p class=message>Can't complain. It's always busy in the kitchen, but I enjoy it. What can I make for you tonight?<p class="message sent">Well, we have a table of six and they are looking to try some new dishes. Can you recommend anything?<p class=message>Absolutely. Our specials for tonight include seared scallops with a ginger glaze or grilled pork chops with a peach chutney. Both are delicious.<p class="message sent">Those both sound amazing. How spicy is the ginger glaze?<p class=message>It has a bit of a kick to it, but not too spicy. It's a nice balance with the sweetness of the scallops.<p class="message sent">Okay, great. And what sides do you recommend with the pork chops?<p class=message>Our roasted Brussels sprouts with balsamic glaze and garlic mashed potatoes are always a hit with the pork chops.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I'll let the table know. Oh, and before I forget, one of our guests is vegan. Do you have any vegan options tonight?<p class=message>Of course. We have a roasted vegetable ratatouille as our vegan option tonight. It's a mix of seasonal vegetables, roasted with garlic and herbs.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. Thank you for the recommendations. I'll go put in the order now.<p class=message>My pleasure. Let me know if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Will do. Oh, and by the way, did you hear about the new restaurant opening down the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class="message sent">It's called "Burger Bonanza". They specialize in gourmet burgers with unique toppings. I heard they are even doing a burger with peanut butter and jelly.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. Maybe we should check it out after our shift.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It might be a nice change from all the fancy plating we do on a daily basis.<p class=message>(laughs) I couldn't agree more. Let's hope they have some good fries to go along with those burgers.<p class="message sent">Fingers crossed. Alright, I better go check on those orders. Thanks again for your help.<p class=message>Anytime. Have a great shift.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f09e6a8f-a344-47ec-90b4-3c24376b08ae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
