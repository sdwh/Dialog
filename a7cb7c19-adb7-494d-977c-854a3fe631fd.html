What's up?<p class=message>I was wondering how you feel about using Razor Pages compared to other frameworks in the market.<p class="message sent">I personally prefer Razor Pages for its simplified and intuitive syntax. It also allows for easy integration with our existing technologies.<p class=message>That's great to hear. As the frontend developer, I appreciate the simplicity too. The code is much cleaner and easier to maintain.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Plus, since it's a newer framework, there are fewer security vulnerabilities and better performance.<p class=message>Speaking of security, have you implemented any security measures for the backend?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've added a few layers of authentication and authorization to make sure only authorized users have access to certain resources.<p class=message>Perfect. I'll also make sure to include some user-friendly error messages on the frontend to guide users in case of any unauthorized access.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Let's make sure to have a smooth collaboration between the frontend and backend teams to deliver a great user experience.<p class=message>Agreed. And maybe we can celebrate the launch with some pizza and beers!<p class="message sent">Now you're speaking my language! I think we deserve it after all the hard work we'll put into this project.<p class=message>Absolutely. I'll make sure to bring my appetite and we can all toast to a successful launch.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a7ca6497-fe2b-4b7f-b583-5708d6199780.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
