But I'm a bit worried about the luggage restrictions.<p class=message>Don't worry, I looked it up. We're allowed to bring one carry-on bag and one checked bag each.<p class="message sent">Okay, but what's the size limit for the carry-on bag? I don't want to have to check in my bag at the last moment.<p class=message>According to the website, it should be no bigger than 56 cm x 45 cm x 25 cm.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a little small. What if I have a really bulky jacket or something?<p class=message>You can wear it on the plane or stuff it in your checked bag. But be careful not to exceed the weight limit of 7 kg for the carry-on.<p class="message sent">Got it. And what about the checked bag size limit?<p class=message>It's usually around 158 cm (length + width + height) and 23 kg in weight. But you should double-check with the airline we're flying with.<p class="message sent">Right, good idea. And do they charge extra for overweight or oversized bags?<p class=message>Yes, unfortunately. It can be quite expensive, so we should try to stick to the limits.<p class="message sent">Yeah, let's not risk it. I don't want to pay more than the cost of the flight just for my luggage!<p class=message>Haha, I hear you. Speaking of which, have you considered investing in a lighter suitcase? It could save you a lot of hassle and money in the long run.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Well, I recently bought a suitcase made of polycarbonate material and it's been a game-changer. It's super lightweight but also sturdy, and it has a lot of compartments for organizing my stuff.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds great. Maybe I'll look into that. Thanks for the tip!<p class=message>Anytime. Do you need help weighing your bags or anything before we leave?<p class="message sent">Actually, yeah, that would be awesome. Let's make sure we're not over the limit!<p class=message>You got it. Now, have you packed your sunscreen and swimsuit for the beach?<p class="message sent">(Laughs) Yep, those are definitely in there. Can't wait for some fun in the sun!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e853596d-be15-425b-8b08-8bf5b3d0bdc5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
