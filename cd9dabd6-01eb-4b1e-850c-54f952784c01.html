There's nothing like the sound of waves crashing on the shore.<p class=message>I completely agree. Say, I've been working on a new novel, and I wanted to get your opinion.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm all ears. What's it about?<p class=message>It's a rom-com about a guy who falls in love with his boss, but she doesn't know he exists.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. What's the twist?<p class=message>Well, the guy's best friend is secretly in love with him, and he's trying to sabotage the relationship with the boss.<p class="message sent">That's hilarious! I can definitely see this being a hit.<p class=message>Thanks B, that means a lot coming from you. I was hoping to get it published soon, but I don't know where to start.<p class="message sent">Have you thought about going through a publishing house?<p class=message>I have, but I'm not sure how to get my foot in the door.<p class="message sent">I could put you in touch with some people who might be interested. Plus, we could work on a marketing plan together.<p class=message>Wow, that would be amazing! Thank you so much, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's what I'm here for.
