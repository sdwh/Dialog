How about you?<p class="message received message-content">I'm excited for my trip to Delhi. Have you driven there before?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I have. It's a busy city, but I know the roads well.<p class="message received message-content">That's great to hear. Have you had any interesting experiences as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely. One time, I had a passenger who left their phone behind. I was able to return it to them and they were so grateful.<p class="message received message-content">That's really awesome. Speaking of phones, do you have any favorite apps you like to use?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I love using navigation apps to help me get around the city. What about you?<p class="message received message-content">I like using language learning apps. I'm trying to improve my Hindi before I arrive in Delhi.<p class="message sent message-content">That's impressive. I actually speak Hindi fluently. Do you want some tips?<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely! What are some common phrases I should know?<p class="message sent message-content">Well, "Namaste" is a common greeting, and "shukriya" means thank you. And if you want to bargain at a market, "kitna" means how much.<p class="message received message-content">Thank you for the tips. This is going to be a great trip!<p class="message sent message-content">I agree. Delhi is a wonderful city to explore. Do you have any plans while you're there?<p class="message received message-content">I'm planning on visiting the Red Fort and trying some delicious street food. What about you?<p class="message sent message-content">If I have some free time, I like to visit the Lotus Temple and try some chaat, which is a popular snack in Delhi.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds amazing. I can't wait to try it. We're almost there, thank you for the great conversation.<p class="message sent message-content">No problem, thank you for keeping me company on the drive. Have a great trip in Delhi!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0038e317-fd52-4bdc-9fa3-abfe0d1136b5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
