How long have you been a taxi driver in this city?<p class="message sent">Good morning, sir! I've been driving a taxi in Beijing for about ten years now. It's a great city.<p class=message>That's amazing! What do you like most about driving a taxi here?<p class="message sent">I love meeting people from all walks of life and learning about their stories. Plus, I get to explore different parts of the city every day.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. How do you deal with difficult customers?<p class="message sent">I always try to stay calm and patient. Most of the time, they just need someone to listen to them.<p class=message>That's very wise. Do you have any favorite spots in Beijing that you like to take tourists?<p class="message sent">Yes, I always recommend the Great Wall and the Forbidden City. They're both amazing places to visit.<p class=message>I've been to the Forbidden City before, but I haven't had a chance to visit the Great Wall yet. Maybe you could take me there one day?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'll be happy to take you there. It's a breathtaking sight to see.<p class=message>Great, I'm looking forward to it. So, what do you like to do when you're not driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">I enjoy spending time with my family and playing mahjong with my friends. It's a great way to relax and unwind.<p class=message>Mahjong sounds like fun. I've always wanted to learn how to play.<p class="message sent">You should definitely give it a try. It's not as complicated as it looks.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the advice. Oh, it looks like we're almost at my destination. Thanks for the ride!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, sir. It was my pleasure. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aaa9f8cf-0193-43f7-81a2-60295a5915de.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
