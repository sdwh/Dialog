What's up with that?<p class=message>Well, it's just weird that they're doing the interview in the middle of nowhere.<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah, that does sound a little odd.<p class=message>I mean, what kind of story warrants an interview miles away from civilization?<p class="message sent">Maybe they're interviewing a hermit who lives in a cave or something.<p class=message>(laughs) That would be interesting. But seriously, can you imagine being a journalist and having to go to such remote locations for an interview?<p class="message sent">Not to mention the preparation that must go into it. You'd have to pack food and supplies and make sure you have all your equipment ready.<p class=message>Yeah, and dealing with the elements can't be easy either.<p class="message sent">I bet they have some crazy stories to tell, though. Maybe we should become journalists and do our own on-site interviews.<p class=message>(laughs) Yeah, because packing snacks and making small talk with a hermit is exactly what we need in our lives.<p class="message sent">Hey, you never know. It might make for a great story.<p class=message>True. But for now, let's just stick to our day jobs and leave the extreme journalism to the pros.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2d897ea9-06b3-4507-a819-bac7f06ffb7d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
