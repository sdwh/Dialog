It's basically a set of guidelines for creating a secure system, right?<p class=message>That's right. And it's becoming more and more important these days with all the cyber threats out there.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, have you ever implemented it before?<p class=message>Yeah, at my previous job we followed the framework and it worked really well.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I'm thinking of implementing it in my company too. Do you have any tips for me?<p class=message>Sure. Start by identifying the assets you want to protect, and then conduct a risk assessment.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. And what about the actual architecture design?<p class=message>That's where you'll need to bring in your IT team to actually build out the system according to the guidelines.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. But how do you ensure that it stays secure over time?<p class=message>That's where continuous monitoring and improvement comes in. You need to constantly review and update your security measures as the technology and threats evolve.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So it's an ongoing process.<p class=message>Exactly. And it's better to get started sooner rather than later, so you can avoid any potential breaches.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I definitely don't want to have to deal with that. Thanks for the advice!<p class=message>No problem. Remember, it's always better to be safe than sorry.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3568554e-2e30-42ed-8ce4-e180823dd12c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
