Are you handling the procurement for it?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct A. It's our priority right now. Would you happen to know how many licenses we need?<p class=message>Based on the current number of users and servers, I would say we need around 20 licenses to cover everything.<p class="message sent">Okay, that's manageable. I'll look into the options we have and see which one suits us best.<p class=message>Don't forget to consider the pricing too. We want to make sure we're getting our money's worth.<p class="message sent">Of course, I'll try to negotiate with the vendors to see if we can get a good deal. Do you have any idea how long it will take to implement the new licenses?<p class=message>It shouldn't take too long. I can help with the installation and configuration. We just need to make sure that everything is compatible with our current system.<p class="message sent">That would be great A. I appreciate your help. Do you think we should go for the standard or enterprise edition of SQL Server?<p class=message>I think the standard edition should be enough for our needs, unless we are planning to expand and add more users or servers in the future.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. We can always upgrade in the future if the need arises. Thanks for your input A.<p class=message>No problem at all B. I'm always happy to help. Let me know if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Sure thing A. Thanks again for your assistance. Let's touch base tomorrow to discuss the progress. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=45a0bfa7-a023-40e0-8ed5-bb4a76ed6f0b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
