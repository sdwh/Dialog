How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey there, A! Not bad, not bad. Just getting psyched up for a busy shift today.<p class=message>Yeah, it's Saturday so we're going to see a lot of customers for sure. But that's okay, we're up for the challenge!<p class="message sent">You bet! By the way, have you heard about the new cut of meat we're serving today?<p class=message>No, what cut is it? I'm always up for trying something new.<p class="message sent">It's called a beef clod, apparently. The chef says it's like a cross between brisket and chuck roast.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting! I'll have to sneak a taste later.<p class="message sent">For sure! And speaking of trying new things, have you checked out the craft beer list lately?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely try the local IPA from that new brewery down the road. It's got a great hop flavor without being too bitter.<p class=message>Sounds good, thanks for the tip. Hey, did you see that table of kids over there? It looks like they're all having a birthday party.<p class="message sent">Yeah, they're so cute! I might have to swing by and sing "Happy Birthday" to them later.<p class=message>Haha, that would be awesome. I bet they'd love it.<p class="message sent">Oh, and have you seen how many people have been taking pictures of their food and posting them on Instagram?<p class=message>Yes, it's insane! But hey, if it means more business for us, I'm all for it.<p class="message sent">Good point. And speaking of business, we better get back to work before we get too chatty and fall behind on orders.<p class=message>Right you are, B. See you out there!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9c5c0758-e47e-4294-a7c2-a91a8f0e7b9d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
