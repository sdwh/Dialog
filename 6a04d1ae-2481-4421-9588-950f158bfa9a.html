Are you also checking out the room amenities?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I just want to make sure I have everything I need for my stay here.<p class=message>Same here! I've learned that when it comes to traveling, it's better to be prepared than sorry.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Have you seen the fancy coffee maker they have here?<p class=message>Yes, I did! But I don't even know how to use it. Do you?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have no clue. But we can experiment and hopefully not burn the place down.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! I'll bring some coffee and we can be our own baristas.<p class="message sent">Haha, great idea. By the way, have you tried the cookies they put in that jar?<p class=message>No, not yet. Are they good?<p class="message sent">They're awesome! But I learned my lesson when I ate too many on my first day here.<p class=message>Oh no, did you get a sugar rush?<p class="message sent">Worse. I fell asleep in the middle of the day and missed my tour. Crazy jet lag.<p class=message>Aww, that's too bad. But at least you got some rest.<p class="message sent">True that. And now, thanks to those cookies, I don't even need an alarm clock. The sugar will wake me up.<p class=message>Haha, you're funny. I hope we get to explore the city tomorrow and try some local food.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's the plan! But for now, I'm gonna go make some coffee and taste those cookies again. See you around, fellow traveler!<p class=message>Bye for now! Enjoy your snack time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6a00edea-369d-4990-a8b0-1f3dfa4830fd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
