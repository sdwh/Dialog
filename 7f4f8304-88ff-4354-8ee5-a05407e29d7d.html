I heard you're interested in learning ASP.NET Core. It's a great choice!<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been doing some research and it looks like a useful skill to have in the tech industry.<p class=message>Absolutely. What's your background in programming? Do you have any experience with C# or .NET Framework?<p class="message sent">I have some basic knowledge of C# but I haven't worked with .NET Framework before.<p class=message>That's okay. ASP.NET Core is actually a different framework altogether, although it does share some similarities with .NET Framework.<p class="message sent">Really? What makes it different?<p class=message>Well, for one thing, ASP.NET Core is cross-platform, so it can run on Windows, Linux, or macOS. It's also more modular and lightweight than .NET Framework.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. How should I go about learning it?<p class=message>I recommend starting with some online tutorials to get a feel for the basics. Then you can try building a small project on your own. There are also plenty of books and courses available if you want to dive deeper.<p class="message sent">Do you have any tips for someone just starting out?<p class=message>Sure! Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Programming is all about trial and error. And make use of online resources - Stack Overflow is your friend!<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice. I'm looking forward to learning more about ASP.NET Core.<p class=message>No problem. It's a fun framework to work with. And who knows? Maybe you'll become a seasoned ASP.NET Core developer like me someday!<p class="message sent">Haha, I hope so! Thanks again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7f4f6f44-9edc-4f2e-96e1-8972fbd480ce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
