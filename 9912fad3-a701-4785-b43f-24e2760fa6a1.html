Have you eaten yet?<p class="message sent">Yup! I've had some chicken with rice for lunch. How about you?<p class=message>Me too! But I prefer my rice with some veggies.<p class="message sent">That's healthy, but I like my rice with some spice. Have you tried it with curry?<p class=message>Oh yeah, curry rice is my favorite! But have you tried a rice bowl with all the toppings?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! It's like a mini meal in a bowl.<p class=message>And have you ever heard of sushi rice? It's a special kind of rice you use to make sushi.<p class="message sent">I've heard of it, but I've never tried making sushi at home. Have you?<p class=message>Yes I have! It's actually easier than it looks. You just need the right type of rice and some patience.<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe I'll try it someday. But have you ever had those cute little rice balls called onigiri?<p class=message>Yes! They're so cute and delicious. I love them filled with tuna and mayonnaise.<p class="message sent">Me too! But have you tried ones with pickled plum inside? It's a bit sour but tasty.<p class=message>Oh, I haven't tried those yet. I'll have to give it a go! Rice is so versatile, don't you think?<p class="message sent">Definitely! It's amazing how many different dishes you can make with it. Got any other recommendations?<p class=message>Hmm, have you tried sticky rice with mango for dessert? It's a popular Thai dish.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But that sounds like a perfect way to end a meal. Thanks for the suggestion!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=991196a0-afd5-4d7e-8ca9-4e7ee111b9ab.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
