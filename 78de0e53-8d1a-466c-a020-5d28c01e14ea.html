Did you get the report from our vulnerability scanner?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm good! Yes, I did. There were quite a few findings this time. Have you had a chance to go through them?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. Some of them are pretty serious. We need to prioritize and make sure we patch them ASAP.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. But first, can we take a moment and appreciate the creativity of these hackers? I mean, how do they even think of these stuff?<p class=message>Haha, yeah. It's like they're playing a game of "find the weakest link" with our system.<p class="message sent">Speaking of games, did you know that one of the most common passwords used is "password123"? I mean, do people even try anymore?<p class=message>It's mind-boggling! It's like they're just asking to be hacked.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's get serious again. Any updates on the patching process?<p class=message>We've identified the most critical vulnerabilities and have started working on the patches. It might take a while, but we'll get there.<p class="message sent">Great, thanks for the update. By the way, have you ever thought about trying out ethical hacking?<p class=message>I have considered it. It sounds like it would be both challenging and rewarding.<p class="message sent">Imagine being able to hack into a system but with the purpose of identifying and fixing vulnerabilities rather than causing harm. It's like being a cyber superhero!<p class=message>Haha, I like the sound of that. We should form a league of cyber superheroes!<p class="message sent">That's genius! We can wear capes with the code of conduct printed on the back.<p class=message>I am totally on board with this. But for now, let's focus on patching those vulnerabilities and keeping our system safe.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=78d8d94b-8c3a-4f0a-9ccb-704a5c46d491.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
