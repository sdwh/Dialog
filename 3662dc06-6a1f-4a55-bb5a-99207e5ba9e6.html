Have you seen our friend at the library lately?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I saw her there the other day. She was deep in a book.<p class=message>What book was she reading?<p class="message sent">She was reading "The Silent Patient" by Alex Michaelides.<p class=message>Oh, I heard that's a really good book. Did she like it?<p class="message sent">Yes, she loved it. She said it was a complete page-turner which she couldn't put down until she finished it.<p class=message>That sounds great. What have you been reading recently?<p class="message sent">I just read "Little Fires Everywhere" by Celeste Ng. It was amazing! I loved the plot and the characters were so well-developed.<p class=message>Hmmm, I've heard of that book. Maybe I'll have to give it a read.<p class="message sent">Definitely! It's worth adding to your reading list.<p class=message>Have you read anything else by Celeste Ng?<p class="message sent">Yes, I also read "Everything I Never Told You" and it was also really good.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation! I'll definitely have to check out both of those books.<p class="message sent">No problem! Let me know what you think when you're done reading them.<p class=message>Absolutely, I'll be sure to give you my thoughts.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Do you have any other books on your reading list?<p class=message>I just picked up "Educated" by Tara Westover.<p class="message sent">That book is incredible. It's one of my favorites. You won't be disappointed.<p class=message>I can't wait to dive in.
