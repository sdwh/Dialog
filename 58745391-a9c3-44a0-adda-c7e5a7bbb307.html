What are they?"<p class=message>"They're these yummy cookies made with oatmeal, coconut, and golden syrup. Have a taste!"<p class="message sent">"Wow, these are really good! Do you know the history behind Anzac biscuits?"<p class=message>"Yes, I do. They were originally made by wives and mothers of Australian and New Zealand soldiers during World War I. They were sent to the front line because they lasted long without spoiling."<p class="message sent">"That's really interesting. I can see why they're called 'Anzac' biscuits."<p class=message>"Yeah, they're quite popular in Australia and New Zealand."<p class="message sent">"I can see why! Do you have a recipe for them?"<p class=message>"Yes, I do. It's actually really simple. Just combine rolled oats, desiccated coconut, flour, sugar, butter, and golden syrup. Then bake for about 15 minutes."<p class="message sent">"Thanks! I might have to give that a try."<p class=message>"Definitely do! They make a great snack."<p class="message sent">"I can see how these would be perfect to take on a hiking trip or a picnic."<p class=message>"Oh, definitely. They're also great with a cup of tea or coffee."<p class="message sent">"I'm definitely going to have to try that. Do you want to make some together sometime?"<p class=message>"Sure! That sounds like a fun idea."<p class="message sent">"Great! Let's plan for next weekend."<p class=message>"Sounds like a plan.
