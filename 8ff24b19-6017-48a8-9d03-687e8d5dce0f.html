How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Hi! I've been driving a taxi for 10 years. What brings you to Beijing?<p class=message>I'm here for a business trip. How about you, do you live in Beijing?<p class="message sent">Yes, I was born and raised in Beijing. It's a great city! Have you tried any of the local food yet?<p class=message>Yes, I tried some Peking duck last night. It was delicious!<p class="message sent">Ah, Peking duck is one of my favorites. Did you have any trouble finding a good restaurant?<p class=message>Actually, I just asked a local for a recommendation. Do you have any other recommendations for good restaurants?<p class="message sent">Sure, there are many great places to eat in Beijing. Have you ever tried hot pot before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's that?<p class="message sent">It's a Chinese specialty where you cook different types of meats and vegetables in a boiling pot of soup. It's very popular in the winter.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting! Maybe I'll have to try it before I leave.<p class="message sent">You definitely should! So, where are you from originally?<p class=message>I'm from Los Angeles. Have you ever been there?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But I hear it's a beautiful city. Have you ever been to the Great Wall of China?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm hoping to go this weekend. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Many times! It's a must-see attraction if you're in Beijing. Just make sure to wear comfortable shoes.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice! I'm looking forward to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8ff22282-3859-4821-8ed3-a10cbb0036cf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
