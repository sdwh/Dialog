I noticed you're a chef. Do you have any tips for me as a diver on how to get the freshest seafood?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! As a chef, I can tell you the quality of seafood affects the taste of our dishes. The fresher the better!<p class=message>That makes sense. So, how do I know which fish to choose?<p class="message sent">Look for fish with clear eyes and a shiny skin. They should also smell of the sea, not fishy.<p class=message>Okay, got it! What about shellfish?<p class="message sent">For shellfish, make sure their shells are tightly closed. If they're open, they might not be alive.<p class=message>Interesting, I never knew that. Do you have any favorite seafood dishes?<p class="message sent">I love making seafood risotto with fresh scallops and shrimp. It's delicious and easy to make.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! As a diver, I always wondered how my catch would taste in a dish. I'll have to try that recipe.<p class="message sent">Definitely give it a go! It's a great way to showcase the freshness of your catch.<p class=message>Speaking of freshness, do you have any other tips for me to keep my seafood fresh?<p class="message sent">Keep your catch cold and out of sunlight as soon as you catch it. This will help preserve its freshness.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice! I'll keep that in mind for my next dive.<p class="message sent">No problem. It's important to respect the sea and the creatures that live in it. Good luck with your next catch!<p class=message>Thanks, I'll do my best! And thanks for chatting with me, it's been great getting tips from a chef.<p class="message sent">Anytime! It's always fun to talk about seafood with someone who loves it just as much as I do!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7819aa23-de0c-44bd-80fe-22db716703cc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
