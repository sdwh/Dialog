I'm the bento chef for today. Nice to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Hi! Nice to meet you too. I'm the tea master. It seems like it's going to be a busy day.<p class=message>Yes, we have a lot of orders today. What's your most popular drink?<p class="message sent">Our matcha latte is quite popular these days. How about your bento?<p class=message>Our salmon teriyaki bento is always a hit! But our custom-made bento is becoming more popular too.<p class="message sent">Custom-made bento? How does that work?<p class=message>We offer a selection of ingredients, and customers can choose what they want in their bento. It's all made fresh to order.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting! Maybe I'll try one for lunch today.<p class=message>Sure, give it a try! We also have vegetarian and gluten-free options for those with dietary restrictions.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's really considerate. How long have you been working here?<p class=message>I've been working here for about a year now. I love making bento, and it's always great to see our customers enjoying their meals.<p class="message sent">Same here! Tea is my passion, and I love creating new and interesting drinks for our customers.<p class=message>That's great! Maybe you can come up with a new drink to pair with our custom-made bento.<p class="message sent">I have a few ideas already! How about a refreshing lemon green tea to go with a vegetarian bento?<p class=message>That sounds perfect! We can even add some citrus flavors to the bento to complement the tea.<p class="message sent">Yes, let's collaborate on this. I think our customers will love it.<p class=message>Absolutely! It's always fun to work together and come up with something new.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And it looks like we have a lot of happy customers today. Let's keep up the good work!<p class=message>Yes, let's do our best to provide a delicious and satisfying lunch experience for everyone.<p class="message sent">Cheers to that!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d4a34780-1f68-45ea-95b3-066716f6102c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
