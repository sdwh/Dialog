I needed a break from all the writing.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. So what's on your mind? Did you want to talk about your book?<p class=message>Yeah, actually. I've been thinking about getting it published soon.<p class="message sent">That's great! What's the plot about?<p class=message>It's about a time traveler who gets stuck in different eras and has to navigate his way back to the present day.<p class="message sent">Interesting. Have you sent it to any publishers yet?<p class=message>Not yet. I've been trying to make sure everything is perfect before I start submitting it.<p class="message sent">Well, it's important to polish it up before sending it off. Have you thought about self-publishing?<p class=message>I have, but I'd rather go for traditional publishing first. That way, I can get a wider audience.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Have you created a query letter and synopsis?<p class=message>Yes, I have. But I'm still nervous about pitching it to publishers.<p class="message sent">It's understandable to feel nervous, but remember that rejection is part of the process. Keep trying and you'll eventually hit the jackpot.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I really appreciate your encouragement.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. And when you do get published, don't forget us little people!<p class=message>Haha, I won't. I'll be sure to mention you in my acknowledgements.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Now, let's enjoy the rest of the day at the beach!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=128f9066-0a79-4d7f-8125-0e40952c7ca2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
