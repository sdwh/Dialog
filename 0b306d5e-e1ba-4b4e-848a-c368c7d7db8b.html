I think it's a great way to encourage teamwork and collaboration. What are your thoughts on using social media in the classroom?<p class="message received message-content">Interesting question. Social media has become a powerful tool in today's world. However, it is important to use it cautiously and responsibly in the classroom.<p class="message sent message-content">I agree. Social media could help increase student engagement, but it is also important to ensure privacy and safety.<p class="message received message-content">True. Have you also tried using videos for flipped classrooms?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I have. I create videos to explain topics and assign them as homework. Then, we discuss it in class.<p class="message received message-content">Great idea! You could also incorporate Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality tools to make the classes more interactive and engaging.<p class="message sent message-content">Wow, I didn't think of that! That could surely enhance my lessons. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class="message received message-content">You're welcome.
