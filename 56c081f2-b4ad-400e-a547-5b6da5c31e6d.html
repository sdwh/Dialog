How's it going with the back-end development of our new social media website?<p class="message sent">Good day A, it's going well. I've finished the user login and registration system. How's the front-end coming along?<p class=message>Great to hear that! I've just finished designing the UI for the homepage. What do you think?<p class="message sent">It's awesome! It looks very clean and user-friendly. Have you decided which back-end framework to use?<p class=message>I'm still considering some options, but I prefer using Ruby on Rails. It's perfect for building web applications and websites.<p class="message sent">I heard great things about Ruby on Rails. I agree with you, we should give it a try. By the way, what features do you plan to add to the site?<p class=message>Well, aside from the basic social media functions, I'd like to integrate some cool features like instant messaging and an online marketplace.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting! I think instant messaging is definitely a must-have. As for the marketplace, we need to research more on that.<p class=message>Sure, let's talk about it more later. For now, I'll start working on the landing page. Do you mind if I ask for your help about some of the APIs?<p class="message sent">Not at all. I'm here to help. Just let me know what APIs you need.<p class=message>Thanks, B! You're the best back-end developer I've ever worked with.<p class="message sent">Aww, that's too kind of you. You're also an amazing front-end developer. We make a great team.<p class=message>Yes, we do! I can't wait to see the finished product of our website.<p class="message sent">Same here. I'm excited to work on this project with you. Let's make it awesome!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=56bdcd5e-4250-4d58-ba2e-ad38ffd8783d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
