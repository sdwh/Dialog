My name is A.<p class="message sent">Hi A, my name is B and I'm part of the HR team. Nice to meet you. Can you tell me a little bit about your experience in the hospitality industry?<p class=message>Sure! I have worked as a bellhop at another hotel for the past year, so I have experience helping guests with their luggage and providing them with information about the hotel.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Are you comfortable working in a fast-paced environment and handling multiple tasks at once?<p class=message>Absolutely. I know that as a porter, I'll need to be able to handle many different requests from guests and ensure that their stay is comfortable and enjoyable.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Can you give me an example of a time when you went above and beyond to assist a guest at your previous job?<p class=message>One time, I noticed that a guest's luggage had accidentally been sent to a different room. I located the luggage and brought it back to the guest myself. They were really grateful and left a positive review for me on the hotel's website.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! Finally, do you think you have good communication skills, as this is a vital part of the role?<p class=message>Definitely. I'm a friendly and approachable person, and I know how to communicate with guests in a professional and courteous manner.<p class="message sent">Thank you for your answers, A. I believe we have everything we need for now. We will contact you soon to let you know if you've been selected for the next round of interviews.<p class=message>Thank you for considering me for the position! I hope to hear back from you soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b06a5d7d-5fc0-4540-9e9a-6f5be263c5df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
