How's everything going with the machine repairs?<p class="message sent">Not too shabby, A. Just trying to figure out what's causing this darn tractor to stall.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Let me take a look. Hmm, looks like the fuel filter needs replacing.<p class="message sent">Nice catch, A. I was about to rip apart the carburetor looking for the issue.<p class=message>Haha, always good to check the simple stuff first. Hey, have I ever told you about the time I accidentally ran the combine into a pond?<p class="message sent">(laughing) No you haven't, but I'm all ears.<p class=message>Well, I was cutting a field that was a bit too close to a small pond, and I lost control for just a second. Next thing I knew, half the combine was submerged!<p class="message sent">(chuckling) That's a pretty epic mistake, A.<p class=message>Oh, you have no idea. I had to call the boss to bring out a crane to lift it out. Needless to say, I was the laughing stock of the farm for a while after that.<p class="message sent">(still laughing) That's definitely a story to remember. Hey, do you want to grab a cold one after we finish up here?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan, B. I think we've earned it after these repairs.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Plus, I want to hear more stories of your combine mishaps.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=34ae51b3-13cb-483c-998c-0b1dd8dbbf94.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
