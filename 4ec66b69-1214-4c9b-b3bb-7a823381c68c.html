How's the server management going?<p class="message sent">Hey! It's going well, just ensuring everything is running smoothly and securely.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm here for the ISO 27001 audit. Are you ready to go through some security protocols?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm always glad to have an extra set of eyes looking at our security measures.<p class=message>Perfect, let's start with access controls. How do you ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information?<p class="message sent">We have a strict password policy and use multi-factor authentication. We also regularly review access permissions and remove any unnecessary privileges.<p class=message>Excellent. I see you also have a backup and disaster recovery plan in place. Can you walk me through it?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. We have multiple backups that are stored offsite and test our recovery process regularly to ensure it works in case of an emergency.<p class=message>That's very thorough. Have you ever had to use the recovery plan in an actual disaster situation?<p class="message sent">Thankfully, we haven't had to use it yet, but we're confident that it will work if needed.<p class=message>Great job. Let's move on to physical security. How do you protect your servers from unauthorized access or theft?<p class="message sent">We have 24/7 surveillance cameras, biometric access controls, and limit physical access to only authorized personnel.<p class=message>You've definitely covered all the bases. Do you have any questions or concerns about the audit process?<p class="message sent">Not at all. We take security very seriously and welcome any feedback or recommendations you may have.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. You're doing a fantastic job here. Keep up the good work!<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate your kind words. It's always great to have our efforts recognized.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4ec5761b-4423-4d70-833d-8ee7b609cede.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
