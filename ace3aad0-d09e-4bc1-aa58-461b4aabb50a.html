How's it going with our Node.js project?<p class="message sent">Not too bad. Just dealing with some minor bugs here and there. But it's all good, how about you?<p class=message>Same here, just making sure everything is running smoothly. Have you tried the new coffee machine in the break room?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I actually had a cup this morning and it was pretty good. Have you tried it yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm planning to. Do you want to grab a cup together later?<p class="message sent">Sounds good, I could use another cup anyways. Say, have you watched any good shows or movies lately?<p class=message>I just finished watching Squid Game on Netflix. It was pretty intense, but definitely worth the watch. You?<p class="message sent">I actually just started watching it last night! Looks like we have similar taste in shows.<p class=message>Nice! Let me know what you think when you finish it. Oh, by the way, have you heard about the upcoming company retreat?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Where are we headed?<p class=message>We're going to a resort in Bali! It's going to be really fun.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing! I can't wait to go. Have you been there before?<p class=message>Nope, this will be my first time. I've heard great things though.<p class="message sent">Same here. Do you have any plans for what you want to do while we're there?<p class=message>Not yet, but I heard there are some great surfing spots nearby. I might give it a try.<p class="message sent">I'd love to try that too! We should definitely plan a surf lesson together.<p class=message>That sounds like a plan! Our project is coming along nicely, and now we have something to look forward to after it's finished.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ace1693c-cf57-42fd-a46c-acae8a3765ab.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
