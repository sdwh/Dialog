It's all about keeping our passwords safe and sound, right?<p class=message>Correct! And it's important to follow it to maintain data security.<p class="message sent">Definitely, I wouldn't want anyone hacking into my account!<p class=message>Me neither! So, what are the key points of the policy?<p class="message sent">Well, we need to use strong passwords, change them frequently, and not share them with anyone else.<p class=message>That sounds easy enough, but I struggle to remember all my passwords.<p class="message sent">Same! But with a password manager, we can store them all in one safe place.<p class=message>Good idea! And what about the length of our passwords?<p class="message sent">They should be at least 12 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.<p class=message>Wow, that's quite a mouthful. I'll have to get creative with my password choices!<p class="message sent">Haha, yes, maybe try using a favorite song lyric or quote. Just be sure to mix it up a bit.<p class=message>Got it. And what about sharing passwords with coworkers?<p class="message sent">We should avoid it as much as possible. Each person should have their own individual password for their accounts.<p class=message>Makes sense. We don't want to be held responsible for each other's mistakes.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! So, have you updated all your passwords yet?<p class=message>I'm on it. Can't wait to feel like a secret agent with all these complicated passwords!<p class="message sent">Haha, it'll be worth it to keep our company's sensitive information secure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dcc188ca-b822-441a-a3bf-cc452c8bf87b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
