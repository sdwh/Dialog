How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks. So, let's get started on your financial report. Have you been keeping track of your expenses?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. But I'm a bit worried about some of the numbers.<p class=message>That's understandable. But don't worry, we'll go through everything together. Do you have any questions before we begin?<p class="message sent">Actually, I was wondering if we could make this a little more fun somehow.<p class=message>Fun, you say? Well, I do have a game we can play. It's called "Guess the Expense." I give you a category and you have to guess how much you've spent on that category this year.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Let's try it!<p class=message>Alright, first category is "Office Supplies."<p class="message sent">Hmm...I'd say around $500.<p class=message>Close! It's actually $750. Okay, next category: "Travel Expenses."<p class="message sent">I'm pretty sure this one is around $3,000.<p class=message>You're good! It's exactly $3,000. Alright, last one: "Meals & Entertainment."<p class="message sent">I think I've spent around $1,500 on this one.<p class=message>Almost! It's actually $1,200. Great job, B! That was a fun way to go through your expenses.<p class="message sent">Thanks for making it a little more interesting, A. I'm feeling better about this report already.<p class=message>No problem, B. It's always good to have a little fun while crunching numbers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1e5d1072-bb7c-4dc1-847a-e2003cd42800.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
