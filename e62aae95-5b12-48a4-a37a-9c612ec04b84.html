What's up?<p class="message sent">Hey A! I'm good, thanks. How's everything going with you?<p class=message>It's going pretty well. Just working on some front-end coding.<p class="message sent">Nice. So, I wanted to talk to you about a new product we are thinking of designing.<p class=message>Sure, I'd love to hear about it. What's the idea behind it?<p class="message sent">We want to create a platform that enables people to order food from multiple restaurants in one go.<p class=message>That's interesting. What would be our unique selling point?<p class="message sent">The availability of different cuisines and the convenience of ordering from several restaurants at one time.<p class=message>I see. Have you studied the market thoroughly?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have, and there is good potential for such a product.<p class=message>Alright. Should we begin with creating a wireframe or do you have any design inspirations in mind?<p class="message sent">I think we should start with a wireframe and take it from there.<p class=message>Sounds good. Do you have any specific functionalities in mind that we should incorporate?<p class="message sent">Yes, I was thinking of a user-friendly interface with a search bar, filters, and easy payment options. What do you think?<p class=message>Those are great ideas. We could also consider incorporating location-based services and recommendations.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'll make a note of that. We should also think about scalability and how we can accommodate future growth.<p class=message>Yes, that's a good point. We can think about using cloud-based technologies to make the platform more scalable. What do you think?<p class="message sent">I completely agree with you. So, what's our timeline and how long do you think this project will take?<p class=message>We can aim to finish the wireframe in a week and then move onto the coding phase. The whole project should take around 2-3 months, provided there are no major delays.<p class="message sent">That sounds doable. Let's work toward that timeline. Thanks for your insights and suggestions, A!<p class=message>Thanks, B! It was great discussing it with you. Let's make this product a success!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e623d50c-c223-4885-b6d1-e00b12e33080.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
