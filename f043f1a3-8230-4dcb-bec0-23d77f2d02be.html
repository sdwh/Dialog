I think about them all the time. How about you?<p class=message>Yeah, it's tough being away from them, especially during the holidays.<p class="message sent">I know what you mean. I always try to video call or send a care package to show them I'm thinking of them.<p class=message>That's a good idea. I should really do that more often.<p class="message sent">It's the little things that make a big difference. Have you heard from your mom lately?<p class=message>Yeah, she called me last night. She always makes sure to check up on me and asks if I need anything.<p class="message sent">Gotta love moms. How about your friends?<p class=message>I've been keeping in touch with my closest friends through social media. It's not the same as seeing them in person, but it's better than nothing.<p class="message sent">Agreed. I had a long chat with my best friend on WhatsApp the other day, and it made me feel so much better.<p class=message>Yeah, talking to them always puts a smile on my face. I just wish I could give them all hugs right now.<p class="message sent">Me too! But for now, we'll just have to settle for virtual hugs.<p class=message>*sends a virtual hug* There, one for you!<p class="message sent">*sends a virtual hug back* And one for you too! It's not the same, but it's the thought that counts.<p class=message>Definitely. So, what's the first thing you're going to do when you see your family and friends again?<p class="message sent">Oh, I don't even know where to start! Probably just give them all hugs and catch up on everything I've missed.<p class=message>Same here. And maybe have a big family dinner together.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I can't wait.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f0421968-9924-403b-94f3-1f480e8f7912.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
