It's a process to help organizations identify and manage information security risks, right?<p class=message>Yup, that's correct! And it's not just for big companies, small businesses can benefit from it too.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. But the whole idea of risk assessment sounds a bit serious and boring.<p class=message>I see your point, but think of it this way. You get to play detective and identify potential threats to your company's information. Kind of like solving a puzzle!<p class="message sent">Oh, I like puzzles! But what's the benefit of doing this?<p class=message>Well, it helps prevent any sensitive data from getting into the wrong hands. Plus, it can save the company from costly breaches in the long run.<p class="message sent">Ah, I get it now. It's like being a superhero, protecting the company's information from evil hackers!<p class=message>Exactly! And who wouldn't want to be a hero? Plus, it's a great line to add to your resume.<p class="message sent">Well, if it makes me a hero, count me in! But honestly, I think we should take this seriously.<p class=message>Oh yeah, no doubt about it. But hey, why not make it fun while we're at it?<p class="message sent">Agreed! Let's gather the team and turn this into a game. Who knows, we might even end up enjoying it.<p class=message>I like the way you think, B. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9560a7af-369f-45e5-955f-a87311685fee.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
