How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was pretty good, A. How about yours?<p class=message>It was really relaxing. Did you check out that new teahouse that opened up in town?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't yet. Was it any good?<p class=message>I think you would love it. They have a great selection of teas and the atmosphere is so serene.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Maybe we can go after work sometime.<p class=message>Speaking of work, we have quite a few orders to fill today. What do you say we get started?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm excited to make some delicious bento boxes and tea combos.<p class=message>Me too! I love how we can come up with endless combinations of flavors with all these fresh ingredients.<p class="message sent">It's like being an artist, but with food and tea.<p class=message>Haha, I totally get that feeling. Do you have any recommendations for our special of the day?<p class="message sent">How about a chicken katsu bento with a side of hojicha tea? It's a classic combo that never disappoints.<p class=message>I like the sound of that. And for our vegetarians, we could do a tofu and vegetable stir fry bento with a matcha latte.<p class="message sent">Great idea, A. Let's get started and make some satisfying lunches for our customers!<p class=message>Agreed. I have a feeling today is going to be a busy one.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=834c544d-fed1-4cb4-89b6-9cfee820aa74.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
