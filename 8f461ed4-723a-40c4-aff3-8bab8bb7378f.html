How are you doing today, B?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm doing well too. I'm excited for another day of selling our delicious Thai sticky rice desserts and teas.<p class="message sent">Yes, me too! Our customers always seem to leave satisfied and happy.<p class=message>Definitely. It's great to see people enjoy our products. What's your favorite type of sticky rice dessert?<p class="message sent">That's a tough one. I love them all, but I have to say the mango sticky rice is probably my go-to.<p class=message>Oh, that one is definitely a crowd pleaser! Personally, I love the durian sticky rice. It has such a unique flavor.<p class="message sent">Really? Durian is hit or miss for some people, but I'm glad you enjoy it. And speaking of unique flavors, have you tried the butterfly pea tea yet?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's so interesting how it changes colors with the addition of lemon juice. But my absolute favorite is the Thai milk tea.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. I do love the Thai milk tea as well. If only we could serve it with some delicious Thai food!<p class=message>That would be amazing. Maybe we can collaborate with a local Thai restaurant one day.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. In the meantime, let's keep making people happy with our tasty treats and refreshing drinks.<p class=message>Agreed. It's always satisfying to see people smile after taking a bite of our sticky rice desserts or sipping on our teas.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Well, let's get to it - we have some hungry customers waiting for us!<p class=message>Right you are. Let's have another successful day of sales.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8f40502e-7da9-44e4-99de-651e7b543859.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
