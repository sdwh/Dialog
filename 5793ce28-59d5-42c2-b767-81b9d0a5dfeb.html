What kind of music do you like?<p class=message>I'm into a variety of genres, but my favorites are jazz and Broadway show tunes. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm actually a performer in tonight's show. I specialize in musical theater.<p class=message>That's awesome! What's your favorite Broadway show?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a tough one. There are so many great ones. But if I had to choose, it would be "Hamilton".<p class=message>I love "Hamilton" too! Have you ever seen it on Broadway?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It was an incredible experience. The energy in the theater was electric!<p class=message>I bet! So, what role do you play in tonight's musical?<p class="message sent">I'll be playing the lead character in "Chicago". It's a challenging role, but I love it.<p class=message>That's amazing. I've always wanted to see "Chicago" live.<p class="message sent">Well, you're in luck. You're going to see it tonight!<p class=message>I can hardly wait! Do you have any pre-performance rituals?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do some vocal warm-ups, stretch, and have a cup of hot tea. What about you? Do you have any rituals as an audience member?<p class=message>Not really. I just make sure to silence my phone and get comfortable in my seat.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. I hope you enjoy the show tonight. Break a leg!<p class=message>Thank you! I'm sure it will be fantastic. Good luck to you too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5792f980-321d-4b61-9180-5fc2277d71f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
