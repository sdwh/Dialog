How's it going with the development of the marine database website?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It's going great, but I can't seem to find a suitable font for the website.<p class=message>Oh, that's no problem. Have you tried using Arial or Calibri? They work for most websites.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I tried those but they just don't seem to match the theme of the site.<p class=message>Hmm, have you considered using a font that looks like waves or bubbles? That could add a nice touch to the site's theme.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I'll start looking for some wave-like font options. Thanks, A!<p class=message>No problem. By the way, have you heard that dolphins were found swimming in Venice canals during the lockdown?<p class="message sent">Wow, really? That's amazing!<p class=message>Yeah, it's pretty cool. They were probably enjoying the cleaner waters.<p class="message sent">Speaking of marine life, have you ever been scuba diving before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Have you?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. It's a whole other world down there. You should give it a try sometime.<p class=message>Maybe I will! But for now, let's focus on getting this website up and running.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We've got work to do.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d1970211-1ed3-4205-81e4-d67d80b1570c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
