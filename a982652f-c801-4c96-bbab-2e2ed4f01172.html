What's that about?<p class=message>It's all about ensuring information security in organizations. It sets standards for managing and protecting sensitive information.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. That sounds important. What kind of information are we talking about here?<p class=message>Any information that an organization wants to keep confidential, like personal data, financial information, or trade secrets.<p class="message sent">Got it. So, why is it called 'ISO 27001'?<p class=message>ISO stands for International Organization for Standardization. The number 27001 refers to the specific standard for information security management.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds official. Do you need a degree to understand it?<p class=message>Not at all, B. It's a practical approach that any organization can use. It's just like putting a lock on your front door to protect your home.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. So, what are the benefits of using this system?<p class=message>Well, it helps organizations to identify and manage risks to their information, ensure legal and regulatory compliance, and improve overall security management.<p class="message sent">And I bet it helps gain customer trust as well, right?<p class=message>You nailed it, B! It shows that organizations take their security seriously and are committed to protecting their customers' information.<p class="message sent">I like that. Do you think we can get certified in ISO 27001?<p class=message>Absolutely! It takes time and effort, but it's definitely worth it. Plus, it'll give us something fun to talk about at parties!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Count me in, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a97ee0ce-2875-4331-9c09-20a398389fbc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
