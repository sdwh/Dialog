Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hey, I'm the network security expert. Good to meet you too.<p class=message>So, we're here to figure out how to protect our country's confidential data. Where should we start?<p class="message sent">Well, first off, we need to make sure all employees have strong passwords. No "abcd1234" nonsense.<p class=message>Ha! Yeah, let's hope no one's using that. We should also encrypt any sensitive data before storage.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And we need to limit access to certain information to only those who need it.<p class=message>Definitely. We don't want any curious employees snooping around where they don't belong.<p class="message sent">And we should have regular security training for everyone in the agency. Make sure they're aware of common phishing scams and whatnot.<p class=message>That's a great idea. We could even make it into a game or competition to make it more engaging.<p class="message sent">Speaking of games, have you heard of those escape rooms? We could create a security-themed one to test our employees' knowledge.<p class=message>Ooh, I like it! But we should also regularly test our actual security systems to make sure they're working correctly.<p class="message sent">Yes, like a simulated attack. We could hire professional "hackers" to try and break into our systems and expose any weaknesses.<p class=message>And we should have backup systems in case of any data loss. Maybe even a separate physical storage facility.<p class="message sent">Good thinking. And let's not forget about physical security too. We need security cameras and access control measures in place to prevent any unauthorized access to sensitive areas.<p class=message>Absolutely. We should do everything we can to protect our nation's secrets. Thanks for your ideas, B. This has been a great discussion.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always a pleasure to collaborate on such an important topic. Let's continue to work together to keep our country safe.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8bf39f5c-e089-481e-8edd-7cc4be87c061.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
