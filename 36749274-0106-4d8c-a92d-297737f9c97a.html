How's business today?<p class="message sent">It's pretty good, thanks! The heat is bringing in a lot of customers.<p class=message>Yeah, that's true. Speaking of which, have you had one of my hot dogs yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but they smell really good. Which one is your favorite?<p class=message>Oh, that's a tough one. I love them all, but if I had to choose, I'd say the classic Chicago-style is my go-to.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious, I'll have to try it. So, what do you recommend from my side of the shop?<p class=message>Definitely the mango sorbet. It's been a hot seller these past few days.<p class="message sent">I'll take your word for it. So, how did you get into the hot dog business?<p class=message>Well, I've always loved grilling and experimenting with different toppings. Eventually, I decided to start my own business and here I am!<p class="message sent">That's awesome! I've always been interested in opening up my own shop someday.<p class=message>It's definitely a lot of work, but it's also really rewarding when you see people enjoying your food.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. Hey, do you think we can collaborate on a special summer combo deal?<p class=message>Absolutely! That's a great idea. We can offer a hot dog with a small cup of your famous mango sorbet for a discounted price.<p class="message sent">Perfect, let's do it. I knew partnering with you was a good idea.<p class=message>Same here! It's great to have a friendly neighbor in the business. Speaking of which, we should plan a street-wide block party sometime.<p class="message sent">I'm in, let's make it happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3672b5e8-13de-4f90-8da9-b11ac3d5221b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
