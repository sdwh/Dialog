How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, thank you. So, what do we have on the agenda for today's meeting?<p class="message sent">Well sir, we've got a few things to discuss. First, we need to review the budget for the upcoming quarter. Then, we have a project update from the marketing team.<p class=message>Sounds great. But first, can I interest you in a cup of coffee or tea?<p class="message sent">That would be wonderful, thank you.<p class=message>So, did you hear about the new assistant we hired last week?<p class="message sent">Yes sir, I did. She seems to be doing a great job so far.<p class=message>Yes, she is. Plus, she brings in some very tasty baked goodies every now and then. Have you tried any yet?<p class="message sent">I haven't yet sir, but I'll make sure to grab one the next time she brings some in.<p class=message>Definitely do, they're worth it. Okay, let's start with the budget review. How are we looking for the next quarter?<p class="message sent">It seems that we have some room to play with, but we need to be careful with our expenses.<p class=message>Agreed. And how is the marketing team's project coming along?<p class="message sent">They're on track and should be able to deliver on time. However, there are a few areas that need some extra attention.<p class=message>Okay, let's discuss those areas and see how we can help. But first, let's take a quick break and enjoy our drinks.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e98e9ce-9df3-45c6-a1f4-bff746127c06.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
