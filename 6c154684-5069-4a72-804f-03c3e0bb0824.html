What's new with the latest role-playing game you're developing?<p class="message sent">Not much, A! Just trying to add new features and characters that players can enjoy.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. What kind of characters are you adding?<p class="message sent">Well, we're still in the planning phase, but we're looking at adding a few magical creatures and warriors.<p class=message>Cool! Can players customize their own characters too?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We're working on a character creation system that allows players to choose their own race, class, and abilities.<p class=message>Nice! What kind of classes are you including?<p class="message sent">We're looking at the usual classes like warrior, mage, and rogue, but also adding some unique ones like alchemist and druid.<p class=message>That sounds awesome! Are the graphics going to be top-notch?<p class="message sent">Of course! We're working on some really detailed 3D models for the characters, monsters, and environments.<p class=message>I can't wait to try it out. When do you think it'll be ready?<p class="message sent">We're still in the early stages, so probably not for a few more months. But I'm excited to see how it turns out!<p class=message>Same here. Thanks for chatting with me about the game, B. Good luck with the development!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A.
