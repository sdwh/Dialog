Can you help me?<p class="message sent">Of course! Let's see. Can you describe your luggage for me?<p class=message>It's a black suitcase with yellow stripes. It's pretty easy to spot.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll check to see if it's turned up yet. In the meantime, can I offer you a complimentary drink or snack?<p class=message>Oh, that's very kind. I could go for a cup of coffee, if that's possible.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And if your luggage doesn't arrive soon, we can give you a complimentary toiletry kit to tide you over.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. I hope my stuff turns up soon, though!<p class="message sent">Don't worry, we'll do our best to locate it. Is there anything else I can assist you with in the meantime?<p class=message>Actually, I was hoping to find some good restaurants in the area. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Well, we have a great Italian place just down the road. But if you want a really unique dining experience, you could try the sushi bar around the corner.<p class=message>Sushi bar, huh? That sounds adventurous. I think I'll give it a shot. Thanks!<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Is there anything else you need help with?<p class=message>No, I think that's all for now. Thanks again for your help.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, and don't hesitate to let us know if you need anything else. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ba54312a-7a99-42c1-8a03-ced1a1af3738.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
