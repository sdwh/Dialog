Thank you for taking the time to sit with me for this interview.<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to chat over some coffee.<p class=message>So, tell me about your background. Where did you grow up?<p class="message sent">I was born and raised in New York City. A true city kid.<p class=message>That's interesting. Did you always know what you wanted to do when you grew up?<p class="message sent">Not exactly. I went through a few different career paths before finding my niche.<p class=message>What do you do now?<p class="message sent">I'm a comic book artist. It's a dream come true.<p class=message>That sounds like so much fun. Who is your favorite superhero to draw?<p class="message sent">Definitely Spiderman. There's just something so dynamic about his movements.<p class=message>I can imagine. What's the most challenging part of being a comic book artist?<p class="message sent">Probably the deadlines. It can be stressful trying to get everything done on time.<p class=message>I bet. So, let's switch gears a bit. What's your favorite coffee drink?<p class="message sent">I'm a simple guy - just give me a good old-fashioned cup of black coffee.<p class=message>Can't go wrong with that. Lastly, what advice would you give to someone who wants to pursue a career in the arts?<p class="message sent">Keep creating. Don't let anyone discourage you. And don't forget to enjoy the process.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=77940765-5d8f-4808-bec1-9de2dc74beb6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
