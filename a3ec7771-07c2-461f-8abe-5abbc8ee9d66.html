I'm kind of freaking out.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been through a few times. It's not as bad as you think.<p class=message>Really? I heard they ask a bunch of questions and search through all your stuff.<p class="message sent">Sometimes they do, but only if they suspect something. Just be honest and confident when you answer their questions and you'll be fine.<p class=message>What kind of questions do they usually ask?<p class="message sent">They'll ask where you're coming from, what the purpose of your visit is, and how long you're staying. It's pretty basic stuff.<p class=message>I'm just worried about forgetting something important. Like a visa or passport.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, as long as you have all your documents in order, it should be a smooth process.<p class=message>Should I dress up or just wear my regular clothes?<p class="message sent">Just wear what you normally wear. They don't care about fashion.<p class=message>What about gifts or souvenirs? Can I bring those in?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Just make sure they're not prohibited items like fruits or plants.<p class=message>Okay, that makes sense. What if they don't speak English?<p class="message sent">They'll most likely have a translator on hand, or use a translation app on their phone. Don't worry about the language barrier.<p class=message>Thanks for the tips. I feel a lot better now.<p class="message sent">No problem. Traveling can be stressful, but once you get through customs, it's smooth sailing.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a3e817ec-764c-4b30-aa65-8f7ba425489e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
