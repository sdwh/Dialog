It's great to meet you. I'm A, the musician.<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you too, A. I'm B, the manager. I've listened to your music and I think it's amazing.<p class=message>Thank you. That means a lot to me.<p class="message sent">So, let's talk business. What's your plan for your next album?<p class=message>I've been working on a concept album about space travel. Each song is based on a planet in the solar system.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Do you have any singles we can release beforehand?<p class=message>Yes, I have a song about Mars called "Red Planet" that I think would be a good single.<p class="message sent">Great. We can work on that. How about the album release date?<p class=message>I was hoping for a summer release.<p class="message sent">Okay, we can work on that timeline. Have you thought about any collaborations for the album?<p class=message>Yeah, I've been talking to a few other musicians about some features. I don't want to give anything away just yet.<p class="message sent">Of course, we can keep that under wraps for now. What about the album artwork?<p class=message>I have some ideas for that. I've been working with a graphic designer to create a space-themed cover.<p class="message sent">That's exciting! We can't wait to see it.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I'm really excited about this album.<p class="message sent">So are we. We'll start working on the marketing plan and promotion schedule as soon as possible.<p class=message>Sounds great. I can't wait to see what we come up with.<p class="message sent">Me neither. It's always fun to work with talented musicians like you, A.<p class=message>Thanks, B. It's a pleasure working with you too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7412f2a1-5a4d-4302-85ca-246dd67857f6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
