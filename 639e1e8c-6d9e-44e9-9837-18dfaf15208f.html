How long have you been driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">Oh, I’ve been behind the wheel for nearly a decade. What about you? Is this your first time in Guangzhou?<p class=message>No, actually, I’m a regular visitor. I come here quite often for business trips. What’s the most interesting place you’ve ever driven to?<p class="message sent">Well, I’ve had some pretty wild adventures on the job, but I have to say that driving along the Great Ocean Road in Australia was the most breathtaking experience of my life. Have you ever been there?<p class=message>No, I haven’t. But I’ve seen some incredible beach resorts in Thailand. The water there was so clear and blue, it was like paradise.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! I’ve always wanted to go to Thailand. Maybe I’ll take some time off and go explore the beaches there.<p class=message>You should definitely go. So, what do you like to do in your free time?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I spend most of my free time with my family. I have two kids and a lovely wife at home, and we all love to cook together and play board games on weekends.<p class=message>That sounds really wholesome. I love playing board games too. What’s your favorite game?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that’s a tough one. I’d say my all-time favorite game is probably Monopoly. It’s a classic for a reason.<p class=message>Oh, I love Monopoly too! I always like to choose the car as my game piece. What’s your favorite game piece?<p class="message sent">Ha, that’s funny. My favorite game piece is definitely the top hat. It’s stylish and makes you look like a gentleman.<p class=message>(laughs) That’s true. You should wear one of those top hats while you’re driving the taxi.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I’d love to, but I think it might get in the way while I’m turning the wheel.<p class=message>(laughs) Yeah, that might be a problem. Well, we’ve arrived at my destination. Thanks for the conversation, and have a great day!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Thanks for keeping me company on the drive, and I hope you have a wonderful time in Guangzhou. Take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=63998cdd-9e97-4d4d-9011-a6ef0254cd4e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
