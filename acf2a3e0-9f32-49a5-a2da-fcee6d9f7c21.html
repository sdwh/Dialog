Have you dined with us before?<p class="message sent">Hi there, no, this is actually my first time here. I've heard great things about your pizza though, so I'm excited to try it out.<p class=message>Fantastic! You're in for a treat. What can I get for you tonight?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'll start with a Caesar salad and then maybe a classic pepperoni pizza. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Oh, the pepperoni pizza is definitely a customer favorite. And our Caesar salad is always fresh and delicious. Great choices!<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect, thank you. Can I also get a glass of your house red wine, please?<p class=message>Of course, coming right up. What brings you to Chicago? Business or pleasure?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm on a mini-vacation. I've always wanted to visit the city and try all the famous foods here.<p class=message>That's great! Chicago definitely has a lot of tasty options. Besides deep-dish pizza, what else is on your foodie list?<p class="message sent">I'm planning on trying Chicago-style hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. Any recommendations?<p class=message>Definitely try Portillo's for their Italian beef. And for hot dogs, you can't go wrong with Superdawg Drive-In.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tips, I'll add those to my list. So, how long have you been working here?<p class=message>I've actually been working here for three years now. It's a great place to work with a lot of friendly customers.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. I can see why people keep coming back for your amazing pizza. Can't wait to dig in!<p class=message>Glad to hear it. Your salad and wine are ready. Enjoy your meal, and let me know if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! This looks amazing. I definitely made the right choice coming here tonight.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=acf20c70-5e01-442c-88be-955f165244de.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
