How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, but I'm a little stuck on a design problem. Can I get your opinion?<p class="message sent">Yeah, sure. What's up?<p class=message>I'm trying to make this website more visually appealing, but I'm not sure what direction to go in. I know you're great at UI/UX design, so I thought I'd bounce some ideas off of you.<p class="message sent">Of course! I'd love to help. What kind of website is it and who is the target audience?<p class=message>It's for a local restaurant and the target audience is mostly families and young adults. I want to make it easy for them to find the menu and make reservations while also having a creative and fun design.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great challenge! Have you considered using colorful images of the food and using playful fonts to attract their attention?<p class=message>That's a great idea! I was thinking of incorporating some animations too to make it more interactive. But I don't want it to be too overwhelming.<p class="message sent">I think that's a good call. You don't want to give them sensory overload. Maybe using subtle animations on the menu items can work.<p class=message>That could be perfect. Do you have any good resources for finding great fonts and images?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I have a few websites bookmarked that I can send your way.<p class=message>Awesome! Thanks so much. This is really helpful.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help! Do you want me to take a look at your wireframes to make any suggestions?<p class=message>Yes, please. It's always good to get an outside perspective.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll take a look tonight and get back to you tomorrow.<p class=message>Perfect. Thanks again, B. You're a lifesaver.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. That's what friends are for.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ba050616-12a9-4c19-b981-6091daff299c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
