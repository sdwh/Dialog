What's on the menu today?<p class="message sent">Morning! Today we have our specialty iced fruit tea and freshly baked sesame balls. They are amazing!<p class=message>Sounds great! We also have some new savory buns filled with pork and vegetables if you're interested.<p class="message sent">Wow, those sound delicious! I'll have to try them. How do you make the sesame balls?<p class=message>It's a secret family recipe, but I can tell you that we use glutinous rice flour, black sesame paste, and brown sugar as the main ingredients. Then we fry them until they turn golden brown.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds amazing. And what fruits do you use for your iced tea?<p class=message>We use freshly sliced watermelon, honeydew, and dragon fruit, mixed with jasmine tea and a touch of honey. It's very refreshing!<p class="message sent">I'll definitely have to get one of those as well. How long have you been making these delicious treats?<p class=message>I've been a dim sum chef for over 20 years, and my family has been in the business for generations. It's a family tradition to make these delicious treats.<p class="message sent">That's amazing! I've always loved baking and mixing drinks, but I'm still fairly new to the business.<p class=message>Don't worry, it's all about practice and passion. And if you ever need any help, just let me know.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I appreciate that. And likewise, if you want to learn some new drink recipes, I'm happy to share my expertise.<p class=message>That's great to hear! It's always fun to collaborate and learn from each other. Let's keep that in mind for the future.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! So, what do you recommend I try for breakfast today?<p class=message>I would suggest our pork and vegetable buns, paired with our freshly brewed jasmine tea. It's a classic combination that never gets old.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I'm sold. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class=message>No problem, enjoy your breakfast! And let's catch up soon to exchange some recipes and tips.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Looking forward to it.
