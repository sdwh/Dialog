Could you tell me which medication you're currently on?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's for my allergies. The medication is helping, but it's giving me some unpleasant side effects like drowsiness and dizziness.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Those are common side effects with allergy medication. Have you considered trying a non-drowsy alternative?<p class="message sent">I haven't, but that sounds like a good option. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Definitely. We have a number of non-drowsy allergy medications available in store. Have you tried any nasal sprays or eye drops?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Are they effective?<p class=message>They can be very effective in treating allergy symptoms, and they're often much less likely to cause drowsiness or dizziness. Plus, they're easy to use and don't require any swallowing.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good strategy. Thanks for your help!<p class=message>Of course, happy to help. Is there anything else you need assistance with today?<p class="message sent">No, I think that's it for now. Thanks again.<p class=message>You're welcome. Take care and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3c5fd4a6-26bd-444f-8927-794583c8f3c4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
