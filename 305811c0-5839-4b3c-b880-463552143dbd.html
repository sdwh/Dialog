How's the back-end development coming along?<p class="message sent">Hey A, everything's going great. I'm working on implementing the new database schema we discussed last week. What about you, how's the front-end coming along?<p class=message>I just finished redesigning the user interface, it looks much cleaner now. I was also able to optimize the page loading speed by compressing some of the images.<p class="message sent">That's great news. Have you integrated the new design with the existing codebase yet?<p class=message>Not yet, I want to run some tests first to make sure everything works smoothly. By the way, have you tried the new coffee shop down the street yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had a chance yet. Is it any good?<p class=message>Yeah, it's great. The coffee is really good, and they have some amazing pastries too.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious, I'll have to check it out sometime. So, have you been to any concerts lately?<p class=message>Actually, yeah. I went to see a band last weekend, they were really good. What about you, have you gone to any shows recently?<p class="message sent">Not really, I've been more focused on work lately. But I am looking forward to the summer music festivals.<p class=message>Oh yeah, me too. I'm thinking of going to a couple myself. We should compare schedules and see if we're going to any of the same ones.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Well, I should get back to work now. Catch you later?<p class=message>Sure thing. Good luck with the back-end!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3053e948-c1b6-4191-8c12-1f096df6a2dc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
