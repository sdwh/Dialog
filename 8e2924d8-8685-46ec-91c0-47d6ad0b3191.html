But I'm not really familiar with Razor Pages. Can you give me an overview?<p class=message>Sure! Razor Pages is a new way of building web pages with a simplified and more intuitive coding structure than traditional ASP.NET MVC.<p class="message sent">I see. Does it have any advantages over other frameworks?<p class=message>Yeah, one of the major benefits is that it allows you to create a single-page application with ease and speed.<p class="message sent">That's great, but it also sounds like it might take some getting used to.<p class=message>Definitely. But it's worth investing some time to learn the new syntax and features because Razor Pages can provide a much cleaner and more efficient codebase.<p class="message sent">OK. Let's start with a simple mockup and try to build it out gradually.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Plus, we can use JavaScript libraries like Knockout.js and Angular.js to add more functionality.<p class="message sent">Nice! I haven't had much experience with those, but it will be fun to learn new things.<p class=message>Absolutely. And let's not forget the importance of good design and user experience. Our new site needs to be visually appealing and easy to navigate.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's not just about the code, but also about creating a great experience for our users.<p class=message>Exactly. And with Razor Pages, we have the flexibility to easily customize the UI and add responsive design elements.<p class="message sent">This is going to be quite the challenge, but I'm excited to take it on!<p class=message>Me too. And if we get stuck, there's always online resources and forums we can turn to for support.<p class="message sent">As they say, teamwork makes the dream work! Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8e23d9ef-2387-42bc-8029-d19e0caba110.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
