I hope you're doing well.<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too. Yes, I am doing well. Thank you for asking. Where can I take you today?<p class=message>I would like to go to Paris please. Can you take me there?<p class="message sent">Sure. Paris is beautiful this time of year. Have you been there before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. But I always find something new to explore every time I visit.<p class="message sent">That's so true. Paris is full of surprises. What's your favorite thing to do when you're there?<p class=message>I love visiting the Eiffel Tower. It's such an iconic landmark.<p class="message sent">Yes, I know what you mean. Did you know that the Eiffel Tower was originally meant to be taken down after the 1900 World’s Fair?<p class=message>Really? I had no idea. That would have been a shame.<p class="message sent">Yes, it definitely would have been. But luckily it's still standing and we can still enjoy its beauty. Have you tried eating the French cuisine?<p class=message>Absolutely! French food is incredible. I can't wait to have some freshly baked croissants and coffee.<p class="message sent">You're making my mouth water just thinking about that. You know, it's funny looking back, I used to think the Eiffel Tower was actually built by Gustave Eiffel. But it turns out that he only owned the company that designed it.<p class=message>That's interesting. There's always something new to learn when we travel.<p class="message sent">Yes, that’s for sure. We're almost there, just a few more minutes.<p class=message>Wow, that was a quick journey. Thank you for driving me here safely.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Have a great time in Paris and don't forget to try some delicious French cheese!<p class=message>I won't forget. Thank you and goodbye!<p class="message sent">Goodbye, have a wonderful time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=852aa11f-5cfd-4f2a-bb50-f709984d8883.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
