How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, A! Just trying to keep up with all these orders.<p class=message>I hear you. It's been pretty busy today. What's been the most popular drink so far?<p class="message sent">Definitely the matcha latte. I think we've made about 20 of them already.<p class=message>Wow, that's a lot of matcha. Did you know that it's supposed to have some health benefits?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've heard that it's packed with antioxidants.<p class=message>That's right. And speaking of health benefits, have you tried our new smoothie with kale and spinach?<p class="message sent">I haven't, but it sounds like something I should try. Is it good?<p class=message>It's actually really tasty. I was a bit skeptical at first, but now I'm hooked.<p class="message sent">Well, I guess I'll have to give it a try then.<p class=message>Definitely. Hey, do you know how to make a dirty chai latte?<p class="message sent">I do. Why, do you want me to make one for you?<p class=message>Actually, I have a customer who requested it, but I'm not entirely sure what goes into it.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. It's just a regular chai latte with a shot of espresso.<p class=message>Ah, got it. Thanks for the info.<p class="message sent">No problem. Hey, have you seen that new bubble tea place down the street?<p class=message>I have. It looks pretty popular.<p class="message sent">Yeah, but I think we have a few tricks up our sleeve that they don't.<p class=message>Oh? Like what?<p class="message sent">Like our homemade syrups and fresh fruit toppings. Plus, we have you as our charming and knowledgeable cashier.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, I do try my best.<p class="message sent">No doubt about that. Hey, looks like we have another order. You ready?<p class=message>Ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fc5a6f43-ab30-444d-af77-92e52ec187ca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
