Thank you for giving us the opportunity to interview you today. How are you feeling?<p class="message sent">It’s my pleasure, A. I’m feeling great. The weather is perfect for our interview, too.<p class=message>Yes, it’s a beautiful day. So, can you tell us a little about your background and how you got into your current profession?<p class="message sent">Certainly. I actually started out as a clown in a circus. But after a while, I wanted to do something a bit more serious. That’s when I stumbled upon acting.<p class=message>Wow, that’s quite a diverse career path. So, in terms of acting, what type of roles do you usually take on?<p class="message sent">I actually enjoy playing villains. There’s just something about being able to let loose and play an evil character that’s so satisfying.<p class=message>That’s interesting. Is it hard to switch from playing a villain to a more sympathetic character?<p class="message sent">It can be a bit challenging, but that’s what makes acting so fun – the ability to step into different roles and challenging ourselves.<p class=message>Definitely. So, I have to ask, what’s the most difficult scene you’ve ever had to film?<p class="message sent">It was probably a scene where I had to run and scream at the same time. It sounds easy, but it was actually quite difficult to get the timing right.<p class=message>I can imagine. So, aside from acting, what else do you enjoy doing in your free time?<p class="message sent">I love playing board games with friends and family. There’s just something about the competitive nature that’s so exhilarating.<p class=message>That’s great. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today, B. It’s been a pleasure.<p class="message sent">It’s been my pleasure as well, A. Thank you for having me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=81b1a3c6-9f1a-48e9-a159-719e7db6d495.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
