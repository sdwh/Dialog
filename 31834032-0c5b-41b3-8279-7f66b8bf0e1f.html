How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi! It's going pretty well, thanks. What can I make for you today?<p class=message>I was hoping to try one of your freshly baked cakes. Which one would you recommend?<p class="message sent">Well, our chocolate cake is always a popular choice, but if you're feeling adventurous, we also just made a matcha chiffon cake that's been getting some great reviews.<p class=message>Hmm, tough decision. I think I'll go for the matcha chiffon cake. Could I also get a cup of hand-drip coffee to go with that?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I take it black?<p class=message>Yes, please.<p class="message sent">Alright, coming right up!<p class=message>So, how long have you been a barista?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm fairly new to the job. I used to work as a pastry chef, and I still love to bake at home. What about you? How did you get into baking?<p class=message>I've always had a sweet tooth and loved to bake with my grandma. Eventually, I decided to turn my love of baking into a career.<p class="message sent">That's really cool! What's your favorite thing to bake?<p class=message>Definitely pies. I love experimenting with different fruit combinations and pastry crusts.<p class="message sent">Yum! That sounds delicious. *hands over the coffee*<p class=message>Thanks for the coffee! Wow, this is really good!<p class="message sent">Glad you like it. I take pride in getting the brewing process just right.<p class=message>And this cake...it's incredible! You guys really know how to bake.<p class="message sent">Thank you! It's always gratifying to hear that our customers enjoy our creations.<p class=message>Do you guys ever experiment with new flavors for your cakes and coffee?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's one of the things that keeps our job interesting. We want to keep surprising our customers with new and unique flavors.<p class=message>Well, I'm definitely going to have to come back and try more of your creations.<p class="message sent">We look forward to having you back!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3182fdbc-a936-4412-8d03-fd308428f617.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
