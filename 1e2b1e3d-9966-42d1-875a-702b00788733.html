Have you tried any new tools or techniques?<p class="message sent">Well, I've been looking into automated testing. It seems like it could be really helpful in catching bugs early on.<p class=message>Automated testing can definitely speed things up. But it's important to make sure we're covering all the important scenarios.<p class="message sent">Right, I agree. I've also been reading up on exploratory testing. It seems like a good way to catch anything that falls through the cracks.<p class=message>I definitely think we should do more of that. Sometimes the most unexpected bugs can be the most damaging.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And I think we should also make sure we're getting feedback from our users. They're the ones who really know what they want and need.<p class=message>Good point. We should make sure we have a process in place for gathering feedback and triaging issues. That can really help us stay on top of things.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and I think it's also important to be proactive about testing. We shouldn't wait for bugs to crop up – we should be constantly trying to break things ourselves.<p class=message>Ha, yeah – we're the experts at breaking things, right? But you're right, it's better to find issues ourselves than to have our users discover them later.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And if we can catch bugs early and often, we'll be able to provide a much higher quality product.<p class=message>Agreed. Quality is key, and it's something we should always be striving for. Thanks for the discussion, B – I think we've got some good ideas to work with.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. Let's get cracking on improving our testing processes!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1e2ad32d-b4e8-4695-94b1-21551507bb18.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
