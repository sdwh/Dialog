Are you ready for today's experiment?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Yes, I'm excited to see what we will discover today.<p class=message>Excellent attitude! Today, we will be experimenting with a new formula for sunscreen. Have you ever thought about what makes sunscreen so effective?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. I know that it has to do with the chemical compounds that absorb the UV rays before they can penetrate the skin.<p class=message>Very impressive! You're right, it's all about the chemistry. Today, we will be trying a new, all-natural formula that uses zinc oxide instead of chemicals.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. I'm curious to see how it compares to traditional sunscreens.<p class=message>Me too! Let's get started by measuring out the ingredients. Can you pass me the beaker?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Here you go.<p class=message>(after carefully measuring out ingredients) Okay, let's mix this up and see what happens.<p class="message sent">(as the mixture starts to change color) Wow, it's turning into a creamy white color. That's so cool!<p class=message>(laughs) It's like we're making a potion, right? Okay, now let's do a small test on a piece of paper to see how well it works.<p class="message sent">(watching as the paper turns dark) Whoa, it's working really well! The paper is turning black. I bet this will be an effective sunscreen.<p class=message>(smiling) I think you're right! We'll have to do some more testing, of course, but so far, so good. Thanks for your help today, B.<p class="message sent">(grinning) Thank you for letting me be a part of this experiment. I can't wait to see what we'll discover next.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=386391b1-a345-42e7-9387-13af55483df1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
