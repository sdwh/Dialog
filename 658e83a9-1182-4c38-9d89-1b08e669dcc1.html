Are you from that ocean energy company?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. My name is Tom. How can I help you, sir?<p class=message>I am a fisherman and I work in this harbor. I’m concerned about how the development of ocean energy might affect the fishing industry.<p class="message sent">I understand that completely. The good news is that my company has done a lot of research on how we can avoid negative impacts on fishing.<p class=message>That’s encouraging. What kind of measures can your company take to minimize the impact of ocean energy development on fishing?<p class="message sent">We can consult with fishermen like you during the planning stages to find out where the most important fishing areas are. We can also design our energy infrastructure in a way that does not disrupt the fishing activities.<p class=message>That’s great. Another issue is that if marine species were injured or affected by energy development, it could have a serious impact on the catch. What can your team do to prevent this?<p class="message sent">My team takes several measures to prevent harm to marine species. One of these measures is to use acoustic deterrents that help to keep renewable energy devices away from sensitive marine areas.<p class=message>That sounds like a good solution. I appreciate your company’s dedication to protecting the environment.<p class="message sent">Thanks! Our company is committed to sustainable development and we want to make sure that both the energy industry and the fishing industry thrive.<p class=message>Wow, it's really nice to hear that. I think we can work together to find a balance between sustainable energy development and the preservation of marine life.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We need to consider the interests and needs of all stakeholders in this.<p class=message>I agree. Hey Tom, do you have any idea what kind of fish is the biggest catch around here?<p class="message sent">Haha, I'm afraid I'm not an expert in fishing, but I'm always eager to learn about it. Can you show me how to fish in this harbor?<p class=message>Sure thing! Would love to take you out on a fishing trip. Maybe you can teach me more about ocean energy development in return.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great deal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=658b3341-efe4-4d01-876c-8ce71c6451a2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
