Do you have your license and registration handy?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. Here you go.<p class=message>Thank you. So, where are you headed today?<p class="message sent">Just heading home from work. It's been a long day.<p class=message>I understand that, but you must obey the rules of the road for everyone's safety. Have you had any alcohol to drink today?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I don't drink and drive.<p class=message>That's good to hear. So, have you been in any accidents or received any traffic violations in the past?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. This is my first time being pulled over, officer.<p class=message>Well, you're lucky it's only a speeding violation then. I'll just need you to sign this citation, please.<p class="message sent">Alright, I understand. Can I ask how much the fine will be?<p class=message>The fine for this violation is $150. Please make sure you pay it on time or you may face further penalties.<p class="message sent">Thank you, officer. I'll take care of it right away.<p class=message>Alright, sir.
