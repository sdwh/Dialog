How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! It was great! I went to the beach with some friends, and we had a lot of fun.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! Did you do any water sports?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we tried paddleboarding and kayaking. It was my first time doing those, but I think I did pretty well.<p class=message>Wow, I'm impressed! You must be a natural athlete.<p class="message sent">Haha, not really. But it was nice to try something new and challenge myself.<p class=message>Absolutely! And speaking of challenges, how are you doing with your studies?<p class="message sent">I'm doing okay, I think. The math class is a bit tough, but I'm getting help from a tutor.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you have any tips for staying focused during class?<p class="message sent">Well, I try to take breaks and stretch my legs every hour or so. And I also like to doodle in my notebook to help me concentrate.<p class=message>Interesting! I used to do the same thing when I was a student. What kind of doodles do you make?<p class="message sent">Mostly abstract designs or little cartoons. It helps me relax and tap into my creative side.<p class=message>Very cool! You should show me sometime. And speaking of creativity, have you decided what you want to do for the school talent show?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I was thinking about singing a song. Maybe something by Ed Sheeran or Ariana Grande.<p class=message>That would be awesome! I can't wait to see it. And speaking of music, have you heard the new album by Taylor Swift?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! I love it. My favorite song is "Cardigan." What about you?<p class=message>Same! I also really like "The 1" and "August." Taylor is such a talented songwriter.<p class="message sent">Totally agree! She always knows how to tell a story through her lyrics.<p class=message>Well, speaking of stories, we should probably get back to the lesson. But thanks for chatting with me, B. It was nice to catch up.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A! Have a great day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9f2b5182-b150-424a-a9db-2170ea07d1cb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
