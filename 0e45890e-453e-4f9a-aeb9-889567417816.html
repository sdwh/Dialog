Are you a fisherman?<p class="message sent">No, I am a fishmonger. And you?<p class=message>I am a fish quality inspector. I am here to ensure that the fish you are selling are of the highest quality.<p class="message sent">That's great. I always want to make sure that my customers are happy with their purchase.<p class=message>Yes, quality is important. How do you keep your fish fresh?<p class="message sent">I have a special refrigeration system on my boat that helps keep the fish cold until I can sell it. I also make sure to clean the fish properly to avoid any contamination.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Have you considered using ice to keep the fish fresh?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. But sometimes, it's difficult to get enough ice especially during peak season when there is high demand.<p class=message>I understand. Well, using ice can greatly improve the quality of the fish once it reaches the market.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I might have to reconsider then. Thank you for your advice.<p class=message>You're welcome. Another thing to consider is sustainable fishing practices. Have you heard of it?<p class="message sent">Yes. It means we need to fish responsibly and ensure that we are not harming the environment for future generations.<p class=message>That's right. It also helps to improve the value of your fish in the market since consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious.<p class="message sent">I see. Thank you for sharing that information with me. I will definitely look into that.<p class=message>No problem at all. It's always best to work towards improving the quality and value of our fish.<p class="message sent">You're right. I appreciate your help and advice.<p class=message>Of course, anytime. Have a great day and good luck with your sales!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0e4283ea-2319-41c8-b2d8-0fce14f21c91.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
