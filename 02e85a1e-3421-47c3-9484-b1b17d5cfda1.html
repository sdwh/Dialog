Like the phishing emails that try to trick you into giving away your personal info?<p class=message>Exactly! This standard provides measures to avoid those types of attacks.<p class="message sent">Wow, I should implement those measures in my personal life too.

Maybe you could teach her some of these measures so she stops getting scammed.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's a great idea. It's so important to protect your personal information nowadays, you never know who could be trying to steal it.<p class=message>Absolutely! And this standard also covers other types of social engineering, like phone scams, impersonation, and physical theft.<p class="message sent">It's crazy how creative scammers can be in finding ways to trick people.<p class=message>That's why it's important to always be alert and cautious. And by following guidelines like ISO 27001 Social Engineering, we can protect ourselves and our information.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely look into it.
