What can I do for you?<p class=message>Can you check on table three? They've been waiting for their drinks for a while now.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll go check on them right away.<p class=message>Also, make sure you ask Table Four if they want some salsa with their chips.<p class="message sent">Got it. By the way, have you tried the enchiladas we added to the menu?<p class=message>Not yet, but I heard they're really good. Maybe I'll get some for dinner tonight.<p class="message sent">You should! They're amazing, and the spiciness is just right.<p class=message>That's good to hear. How's the new chef working out so far?<p class="message sent">Really well, the customers have been raving about the new dishes. And he keeps the kitchen clean and organized.<p class=message>That's great to hear. We needed someone like him to step up.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and he's a fun guy to work with too! Always cracking jokes and making us laugh.<p class=message>That's important, especially when things get stressful during a busy night.<p class="message sent">Speaking of stress, let me go check on table three and make sure their drinks are on their way.<p class=message>Thanks B, you're a lifesaver. Keep up the great work!<p class="message sent">Will do, A.
