Today, we have B with us, who's a software engineer to talk about the latest ASP.NET Core technology. Hi B, how are you doing?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm doing great. Thanks for having me on the show.<p class=message>No problem. So, can you tell us a little bit about the new ASP.NET Core technology?<p class="message sent">Yeah, sure. ASP.NET Core is a new open-source web framework from Microsoft that is designed to build modern, cross-platform web applications. It has a lot of great features like a modular architecture, built-in dependency injection, and high-performance.<p class=message>That sounds really interesting. Can you give us an example of how ASP.NET Core can be used?<p class="message sent">Sure. Let's say you're building an e-commerce website.

This allows you to build a secure, high-performance website with ease.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds really impressive. How easy is it to learn ASP.NET Core?<p class="message sent">It's actually pretty easy to learn. Microsoft has provided great documentation and there are a lot of resources on the internet. Once you understand the basics, you can start building your own applications pretty quickly.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, is ASP.NET Core suitable for small businesses as well?<p class="message sent">Definitely. ASP.NET Core is scalable, so it can be used for small businesses or larger enterprises. It's easy to set up and get started, and you can customize it to fit your specific needs.<p class=message>I'm sure our listeners will find this information very helpful. Is there anything else you'd like to add?<p class="message sent">Yes, I would like to mention that ASP.NET Core is constantly improving and evolving. Microsoft is always adding new features and updates, so it's worth keeping an eye on for the future.<p class=message>Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with us today, B. It was really great having you on the show.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, A. It was my pleasure to share my insights on ASP.NET Core.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=80d5728a-04fa-4fd0-bdcc-e29cfcf124b1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
