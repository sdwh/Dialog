Have you had a chance to take a look at the project timeline I sent over?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Yes, I did. Overall, it looks good, but I have a concern about the deadline that's been set.<p class=message>What's your concern?<p class="message sent">Well, it seems like there's not enough buffer time. We might run into some unforeseen roadblocks along the way.<p class=message>I see your point. Do you have any suggestions for how we can adjust the timeline?<p class="message sent">How about we add a week or two to the end date? That way, we can account for any unexpected issues that may arise.<p class=message>That's a good idea. Let me take a look at the schedule and see where we can make some adjustments.<p class="message sent">In the meantime, I'll start working on the project requirements documentation so we can get started as soon as possible.<p class=message>Sounds great. Just let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything I can do to help.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. It's always good to have you on the team. Oh, and by the way, how was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was good. I spent some time working on a personal coding project.<p class=message>Nice! What kind of project?<p class="message sent">It's a small game. I'm trying to improve my coding skills and make something fun that I can play in my spare time.<p class=message>That's awesome! I've always wanted to learn how to code. Maybe you can teach me one of these days.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A. I'd be happy to help. It's always good to have more coders on the team.<p class=message>Haha, I'll do my best to keep up with you. Anyway, let's get back to work. We have a project to plan!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1580dcdf-ded8-4b8a-b749-a3d215dbe3a0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
