How are you today?<p class="message sent">Morning, A! I'm doing great, thank you. Just got here at the market and picked some fresh seafood for you.<p class=message>That's wonderful! We always appreciate your dedication to quality. What have you got for us today?<p class="message sent">I have some fresh crabs, prawns, and clams that were just caught this morning. They are all locally sourced.<p class=message>Sounds amazing! We could definitely make some delicious dishes with those. Have you noticed any changes in the market recently?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. With the pandemic, the demand for seafood has decreased a bit, but we are still able to find some great products for you.<p class=message>Yeah, we are definitely feeling the effects of the pandemic as well. But we try to keep our quality consistent and continue to provide great food for our customers.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I'll keep bringing in the best seafood I can find. So, what are you planning to make with the seafood I brought today?<p class=message>Hmm, how about we make some crab cakes, grilled prawns, and steamed clams with garlic butter? That should be a hit with our customers.<p class="message sent">That all sounds delicious! I can't wait to come back and try them sometime. Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help you out.<p class=message>Will do, B. Thanks again for providing us with the freshest seafood. We appreciate it.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. Anytime. Have a great day!<p class=message>You too!
