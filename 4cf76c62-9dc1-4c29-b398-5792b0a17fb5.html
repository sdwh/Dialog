Welcome to our farm. Are you here to pick some fruits?<p class="message sent">Hi, yes! I've never been on a farm before, so I'm really excited.<p class=message>That's great. We have plenty of fruit trees around here. Which fruit would you like to pick?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about apples? I love them.<p class=message>Perfect! We have a section of the orchard dedicated to apple trees. Follow me.<p class="message sent">Wow, these apple trees are huge. How do you pick the apples?<p class=message>You just twist the apple and it should come right off. Don't worry about the ones that fall down, they're probably already overripe.<p class="message sent">I see. Are there any specific types of apples I should look for?<p class=message>Well, we have a few different types of apples here. The red ones are sweeter and the green ones are more tart. It's all up to your preference.<p class="message sent">I think I'll pick some red ones then. How many should I aim for?<p class=message>I suggest filling up a few bags, maybe 10-15 apples. That should be a good amount for personal consumption.<p class="message sent">Okay, sounds good. Is there anything else I can pick?<p class=message>Well, we also have pears and peaches if you're interested.<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. Can you show me where they are?<p class=message>Follow me this way, I'll take you to the peach and pear orchard.<p class="message sent">Wow, this is amazing. I can't believe how much fruit there is.<p class=message>It's definitely a lot of work maintaining these orchards, but it's worth it when we see happy customers like you enjoying the fruits of our labor.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. Thank you so much for showing me around, A. It's been a great experience.<p class=message>It was my pleasure, B. I hope you come back and visit us again soon. Have a safe trip back!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4cf617c4-7ca9-472e-9be8-85a529f536e6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
