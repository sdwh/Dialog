I think we need to adjust some dates.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I’ve been checking out the dates and it’s definitely a tight schedule. Which tasks do you think we need to adjust?<p class=message>Well, I think the QA testing phase needs a bit more time. As you know, we can’t afford any bugs slipping through our fingers.<p class="message sent">Agreed. But what about the development phase? Do you think we can speed that up a bit?<p class=message>I'm not sure if it's possible, but we can give it a try. We can also make sure that we have a clear plan to avoid any unnecessary delays.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. How about the review process? Do we have enough time for that?<p class=message>I think we’re good on that. We’ve carved out enough time for it, and we can always adjust later if we need to.<p class="message sent">Okay, so we’ll adjust the QA testing phase and see if we can speed up the development. I think that should help us meet the deadline without sacrificing quality.<p class=message>Yes, that's our goal. Hey, by the way, have you seen that new pizza place that just opened down the street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Have you tried it yet?<p class=message>Yeah, I went there yesterday, and it was delicious! We should go there sometime after work.<p class="message sent">I'm always down for some good pizza. Let's plan for it next week when we're feeling less swamped with work.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. By then, we'll have made some progress on our tight deadline too.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Here's to hoping! Thanks for the chat, A. Let's get back to work now.<p class=message>Yeah, thanks, B. Catch you later.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f1ca8c3-f23c-4b72-9474-307df200e9e9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
