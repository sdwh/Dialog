My name is A, and I'm a fisherman here in Tasmania.<p class="message sent">Hi there! My name is B, and I'm a chef. It's great to meet you, A.<p class=message>Likewise, B. So, what's on the menu for today's cooking lesson?<p class="message sent">We'll be making Tasmanian seafood chowder, using locally caught fish and shellfish.<p class=message>Ah, that sounds delicious! I catch plenty of fish and shellfish in these waters, so I'm excited to see how they're used in cooking.<p class="message sent">Fantastic, A! Let's get started then. First, we'll need to prep the fish and shellfish by removing any bones or shells.<p class=message>No worries, B. I'm used to handling fish and shellfish, so I can help with that.<p class="message sent">Fantastic. Now, we'll need to saut√© some garlic and onion in a large pot before adding the seafood and other ingredients.<p class=message>Sounds easy enough. Do you always use garlic and onion in your chowder recipe?<p class="message sent">Yes, it adds a great depth of flavor to the dish. Then, we'll add some diced potatoes and fish stock.<p class=message>Yum, I can almost taste it already! Can we add a bit of chili flakes for an extra kick?<p class="message sent">Definitely, A! We encourage you to add your own spin to the recipe to make it your own.<p class=message>Perfect, I'll add just a pinch then. How long do we need to simmer the chowder for?<p class="message sent">About 20-30 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and the fish is cooked through.<p class=message>Got it. I can't wait to try this out back home and impress my family and friends with my new cooking skills.<p class="message sent">I have no doubt that you will, A! Cooking is all about experimenting and trying new things.<p class=message>Thanks for the lesson, B. I can't wait to see what other traditional Tasmanian dishes we'll learn next time!<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, A. Until next time. Cheers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8b343f69-2793-43df-a34b-010e6810488e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
