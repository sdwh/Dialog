Thanks for catching those.<p class="message sent">No problem, it's all part of the job. So, did you hear about the new coffee machine in the break room?<p class=message>No, what's different about it?<p class="message sent">It's got a fancy latte maker and a hot chocolate dispenser. I'm thinking of using my break to try it out.<p class=message>That sounds awesome! I might have to join you.<p class="message sent">Definitely, we can discuss our testing progress over yummy drinks.<p class=message>Speaking of progress, how's your side of the development going?<p class="message sent">It's coming along nicely, just need to run some more tests on the new feature.<p class=message>Great, I'll make sure to check my code too. We don't want any more bugs slipping through the cracks.<p class="message sent">Agreed, let's make sure this release is a success.<p class=message>Hey, did you hear about the company picnic next weekend?<p class="message sent">Yes! I'm so excited. I heard there's going to be a BBQ and games.<p class=message>I'm definitely going to participate in the sack race. I have a feeling I'll win this year.<p class="message sent">Haha, we'll have to see about that. But I'll definitely join in on the pie-eating contest.<p class=message>That's always a fun one. I can't wait to bond with our colleagues outside of the office.<p class="message sent">Same here, it's always great to see everyone in a more relaxed environment.<p class=message>Alright, back to work for now. Let's finish testing and get ready for the release.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Thanks for your hard work on this project, A.<p class=message>Thank you, B. It's great to work on a team with such awesome testers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=792308d0-ab10-474d-a4e1-31556e8709a4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
