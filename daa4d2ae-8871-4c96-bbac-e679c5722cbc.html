Thanks for coming in to help us with our investigation.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Officer. Happy to assist in any way I can.<p class=message>So, I understand you were seen in the area of the crime scene around the time of the incident.<p class="message sent">Yes, but I assure you, I had nothing to do with it.<p class=message>Can you tell me where you were prior to and after that time?<p class="message sent">I was at the local coffee shop before and then went to my friend's house after. I have witnesses who can confirm my whereabouts.<p class=message>That's great to hear. We just need to do our due diligence and gather all the necessary information. Do you mind if we take a few fingerprints and DNA samples?<p class="message sent">Not at all, go ahead.<p class=message>Great, thank you. So, on a lighter note, I hear you're quite the basketball player.<p class="message sent">Ha, yes. I used to play in college.<p class=message>Well, we have a little court outside. Would you like to challenge me to a game after we're done here?<p class="message sent">Sure, why not? It'll be a nice break from all this seriousness.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let's get back to business for now, but we'll definitely play later.<p class="message sent">Deal! Also, can I get a bottle of water? All this questioning is making me thirsty.<p class=message>Of course, no problem at all. Thanks again for your cooperation.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=daa0eded-5803-40f5-87f0-49947a3e1a91.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
