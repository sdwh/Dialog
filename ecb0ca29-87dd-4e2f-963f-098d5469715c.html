How was your morning?<p class="message sent">It was good, thanks for asking. How about yours?<p class=message>It was a bit hectic. I spilled coffee on my shirt and had to change before leaving the house.<p class="message sent">That's too bad. Did you have to rush to get here on time for lunch?<p class=message>No, I made it with plenty of time to spare. Speaking of lunch, have you decided what you want to order?<p class="message sent">Not yet. I can't decide between the chicken Caesar salad or the bacon cheeseburger.<p class=message>Hmm, tough choice. I'm leaning towards the salad, but I'm always a fan of a good burger.<p class="message sent">Maybe we could split them and get the best of both worlds?<p class=message>That's a great idea! We could also get a side of sweet potato fries to share.<p class="message sent">Yum, I love sweet potato fries. So, have you seen any good movies lately?<p class=message>Actually, I just went to see the new Avengers movie. It was amazing!<p class="message sent">Oh, I heard that was really good. I haven't seen any superhero movies in a while.<p class=message>You should definitely check it out. The graphics and storyline were phenomenal.<p class="message sent">I'll add it to my list. So, do you have any plans for the weekend?<p class=message>Yes, I'm going to a concert on Saturday. My favorite band is playing.<p class="message sent">Sounds fun. I'm going to a picnic with some friends and then maybe catch a movie.<p class=message>That sounds like a great weekend. Okay, our food is here.
