I couldn't help but notice all the delicious seafood you have here in the fish market.<p class="message sent">Yes, we're lucky to be right by the ocean. What brings you here?<p class=message>Well, I'm a scuba diver and I'm always interested in finding the best and freshest seafood for my meals.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Well, you've come to the right place. We have a wide variety of fish and shellfish that were caught earlier today.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Do you have any recommendations for what's particularly fresh today?<p class="message sent">Definitely the lobster and the clams. We just got a fresh shipment from our local fishermen this morning.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I'll take a few of each.<p class="message sent">Great choice! And if you have any other seafood preferences, don't hesitate to ask.<p class=message>Actually, do you have any tips for how to cook lobster?<p class="message sent">Easy! Just boil them for a few minutes and serve with melted butter and lemon. It's a classic dish for a reason.<p class=message>Sounds perfect. And how about clams? Do you have a preferred recipe for that?<p class="message sent">I'd recommend steaming them with white wine, garlic, and butter. It's a bit more complex, but the flavor is worth it.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. One last question, if you don't mind. How do you ensure that your seafood is fresh and high-quality?<p class="message sent">We have a close relationship with our fishermen and buy directly from them. That way, we know exactly where and when the fish was caught.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Thank you for all the advice and for providing such fresh seafood!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Enjoy your meal and come back anytime!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8ca7c1be-35c0-4e1f-9f93-b6fa90a31225.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
