My heart was in my throat the whole time.<p class=message>It definitely got my adrenaline pumping! Did you see the view from up there though?<p class="message sent">Absolutely stunning! I'm glad I took the risk and gave it a go.<p class=message>Me too! Although, I have to admit, waiting in that long line did make me a bit nervous.<p class="message sent">I feel you on that one. But when we finally strapped in and took off, it was worth the wait.<p class=message>Definitely worth it. Have you been on any other rides here?<p class="message sent">Just a couple of the tamer ones. I'm not sure I'm ready for the Tower of Terror just yet.<p class=message>(laughs) Yeah, that's definitely not for the faint of heart. But who knows, maybe by the end of the day we'll be brave enough to try it!<p class="message sent">I don't know about that, but I'm definitely up for trying some of the food stalls. I heard they have some amazing churros here.<p class=message>(smiling) Now that sounds like a great idea! Food always makes everything better.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's go find some, and then maybe we can work up the courage to tackle some of those scarier rides together later.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! This is turning out to be a really fun day at the amusement park.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b1a61ae7-c5c8-442c-af5a-dd12bfbe3336.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
