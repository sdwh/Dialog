But as an engineer with an ocean energy company, I'm always thinking about how our work could impact the fishing industry.<p class=message>I appreciate that consideration. What do you suggest we do?<p class="message sent">Well, I think we should work together to find a way to minimize any negative impact. Perhaps, we can collaborate on the use of sustainable energy sources without damaging the fish's habitat.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea! But, you should also consider that fishing is one of the oldest ways of life here, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, I understand that people's livelihoods depend on it. I think we should ensure that our community benefits from renewable energy while still taking care of our fishermen.<p class=message>Yes, we need an agreement that both industries can live with. We can partner with researchers and environmentalists to find a way to benefit all parties and our planet, right?<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. I think we can do something great that will be a model for other industries to follow.<p class=message>Fantastic! This is what we dream of-- a sustainable future for our community & the world.<p class="message sent">Yes, we can make this partnership work, and we can proudly say we did something for the greater good. Thanks for your time & conversation, it was great talking to you.<p class=message>My pleasure too, speak to you soon.
