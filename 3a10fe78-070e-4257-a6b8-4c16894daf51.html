How's everything in the pastry department?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Everything's great. We have a lot of orders today for our mini pastries and cakes.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I noticed that our guests really love our desserts. Which one is the best seller today?<p class="message sent">Our chocolate lava cake is always a hit, but today our lemon tart seems to be catching up in popularity.<p class=message>That's interesting. Maybe it's because of the weather. Speaking of weather, have you seen the forecast for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's supposed to be sunny with a light breeze. Perfect for outdoor dining.<p class=message>That's great news. Maybe we can come up with some new summer-inspired desserts to add to our menu.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. I was actually thinking of adding a strawberry shortcake and a mango panna cotta.<p class=message>Those sound delicious. I also heard that our guests are requesting more gluten-free options. Can you come up with some ideas for that?<p class="message sent">Of course! I can make some gluten-free chocolate chip cookies and a flourless chocolate cake.<p class=message>That's perfect. Thank you for being so creative, B. By the way, how do you come up with new dessert ideas?<p class="message sent">Inspiration can come from anywhere! I love browsing food blogs and experimenting with new ingredients. It's all about trying new things.<p class=message>That's great to hear. You're very passionate about your job, and it shows in the desserts you create. Keep up the good work, B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It's always a pleasure working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3a0f3ad3-28d2-4593-ad88-92dd5d0f714d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
