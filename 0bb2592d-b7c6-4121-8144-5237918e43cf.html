Looks like we're both gonna be busy tonight.<p class="message sent message-content">Yep, lots of meat and fish to grill. I'm excited!<p class="message received message-content">Me too! This is my first time working in Osaka. How about you?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, I've been here for a while now. It's a great city to work in.<p class="message received message-content">I agree. The people here are so friendly! By the way, have you tried the local food yet?<p class="message sent message-content">Of course! Takoyaki, okonomiyaki, sushi- you name it!<p class="message received message-content">Sounds amazing! What's your favorite dish?<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, that's a tough one. But I'd have to say kushikatsu. It's like deep-fried skewers.<p class="message received message-content">Nice! I'll have to try that. But for now, let's get started with the grilling. You go ahead and start with the fish.<p class="message sent message-content">Sure thing! It's important to get the timing just right with the fish.<p class="message received message-content">And I'll start with the beef. Gotta make sure it's cooked to perfection.<p class="message sent message-content">Agreed. We're lucky to work with such high-quality ingredients.<p class="message received message-content">Definitely. Hey, do you have any funny stories from your time as a griller?<p class="message sent message-content">Oh, I've got a few. One time, a customer asked me to make their steak well-done. I told them, "Are you sure? That's a crime in Japan!"<p class="message received message-content">Haha, that's hilarious! I'll have to remember that one.<p class="message sent message-content">And how about you? Any funny moments?<p class="message received message-content">Well, once a customer asked me for the rarest steak possible, so I simply gave them an uncooked piece of beef.<p class="message sent message-content">That's a good one! You and I are quite the jokesters.<p class="message received message-content">It's all in good fun! Now, let's make sure these dishes are ready for our hungry customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0bb16413-3608-47fa-8de5-e25f37385588.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
