How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey! Not bad, busy as always. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. We've got a lot of orders to fill today.<p class="message sent">Yeah, looks like it's going to be another busy day. What would you like to have for breakfast?<p class=message>I think I'll have the chicken teriyaki bento today. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'll go for the salmon bento. And could I also have a cup of green tea?<p class=message>Sure thing! We've got some really good sencha green tea today.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. I always enjoy a good cup of sencha in the morning.<p class=message>Yeah, it's definitely a great way to start the day. So, how's your tea-making going?<p class="message sent">It's going well! I've been trying out some different blends lately and I think they've been going over well with customers.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've been experimenting a bit too with some new marinades for the meats in our bentos.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah? Anything particular you'd recommend trying?<p class=message>I've been using miso a lot more lately, it really adds a nice flavor to the chicken and beef dishes.<p class="message sent">Ah, good idea. I'll have to try it out sometime.<p class=message>Definitely! And speaking of trying things out, have you ever thought about expanding to other types of teas or drinks?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have been doing some research on matcha lately. It's becoming more popular with younger generations.<p class=message>Oh, that's interesting. I might have to try it out myself sometime.<p class="message sent">I'll make sure to prepare you a cup next time we have a chance to chat.<p class=message>Sounds great! Thanks, I appreciate it.<p class="message sent">No problem. Hey, we should probably get back to work. Those orders aren't going to fill themselves!<p class=message>Right, back to work it is. Enjoy your bento and tea!<p class="message sent">Same to you!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f4e3d0a4-9a23-4d5a-8323-dbca97dcf226.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
