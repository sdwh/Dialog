How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm just passing through this cute little town and thought I'd stop by to check out your store. What kind of local specialties do you have here?<p class=message>Oh, we have plenty of them! You should definitely try our Hokkaido milk candies, they're a best-seller. We also have fresh seafood from the nearby harbor and some handmade crafts by the locals.<p class="message sent">Wow, the milk candies sound delicious! And what about the seafood? Is it really fresh?<p class=message>Absolutely! We get it fresh every morning from the fishermen at the pier. You can't get any fresher than that.<p class="message sent">That sounds great! And what about the crafts?<p class=message>Oh, they're lovely. We have some beautiful wooden carved sculptures, handmade pottery, and even some knitted items like scarves and hats.<p class="message sent">That's so cool! I think I'm going to take some of these candies with me, they look too tempting to resist.<p class=message>You won't regret it, sir! Just be careful, they can be quite addictive.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for your help, I'm glad I stopped by.<p class=message>It was my pleasure! Safe travels, sir, and come back anytime.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=95f3195a-0242-4fa0-ad52-b60d0f27cc0b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
