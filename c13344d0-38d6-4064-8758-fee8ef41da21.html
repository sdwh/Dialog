Could you assist me?<p class="message sent">Of course! What kind of games will you be running on the server?<p class=message>Mostly online games like Fortnite and WoW.<p class="message sent">Great! We have a variety of parts that would be perfect for your needs. Do you have any specific requirements in mind?<p class=message>I'd like to make sure the server runs smoothly, even with a lot of players online.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. How about we start with some high-performance RAM?<p class=message>That sounds good. And what about a good processor?<p class="message sent">I would recommend the Intel Core i7 or i9. They're robust enough to handle the load.<p class=message>Perfect, let's add that to the list. What else would you recommend?<p class="message sent">An SSD for faster loading times and a strong graphics card to ensure good quality graphics.<p class=message>Alright, let's go with those. Could you give me a breakdown of the costs?<p class="message sent">Sure, the RAM will cost about $200, the processor is around $400, the graphics card is $300, and the SSD is $150.<p class=message>Sounds good. Let's get those ordered.<p class="message sent">Fantastic! Have you considered anti-static equipment to prevent damage while assembling the parts?<p class=message>I hadn't thought about it. Do you sell those tools?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We have a kit for $30 which includes everything you'll need.<p class=message>That's a great suggestion. Thank you! Can't wait to experience lag-free gaming.<p class="message sent">We're glad we could help. Let us know if you need any other assistance. Have fun gaming!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c1324084-cf4f-4b2e-8e67-23426631d28d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
