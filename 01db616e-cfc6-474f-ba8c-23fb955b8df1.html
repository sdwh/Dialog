I have a few things that might just catch your eye. What are you looking for?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not sure yet. I guess I'll know it when I see it.<p class=message>Fair enough. How about this vintage record player? It still works great and has a really cool retro look to it.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's really neat! How much are you selling it for?<p class=message>I can let it go for $50. It's a steal, considering how much these things can go for online.<p class="message sent">That sounds reasonable. I'll definitely consider it.<p class=message>Great! And if you're into books at all, I have a really interesting sci-fi novel that you might enjoy.<p class="message sent">I do like sci-fi. What's the book about?<p class=message>It's about a parallel universe where humanity has been enslaved by giant alien creatures. The protagonist has to find a way to unite different factions of humans and overthrow their oppressors.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds really compelling. How much are you selling it for?<p class=message>Just $5 for the paperback.<p class="message sent">Sold! I'll take it.

Want to check it out?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! I haven't played that game in years.<p class=message>It's a classic for a reason. And for just $10, it's all yours.<p class="message sent">Deal! Thanks for being such a helpful seller.<p class=message>No problem, happy to make a few bucks and spread some joy along the way.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=01d200f3-13cc-4f64-a4c5-ea6cfc15d2d8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
