How's everything going in the pastry kitchen today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Everything is going well! We had a busy morning with all the prep work for today's high tea service.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I heard reservations for high tea have been increasing lately. What do you have on the menu today?<p class="message sent">We have a variety of delicate pastries like macarons, cream puffs, and mini tarts, along with freshly baked scones and finger sandwiches.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! One thing I always wonder about is how you come up with new pastry ideas. Where do you get your inspiration?<p class="message sent">I draw inspiration from many things - seasonal ingredients, fashion trends, and even everyday objects that catch my eye. Recently, I made a dessert inspired by a famous Shanghai landmark!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds innovative. Speaking of Shanghai landmarks, have you tried any local delicacies since you arrived here?<p class="message sent">Of course! I love the xiaolongbao (steamed soup dumplings) and the shengjianbao (pan-fried buns). They're simple yet tasty!<p class=message>Yes, those are must-tries. Have you ever considered incorporating local flavors into western pastries?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I've experimented with using green tea and red bean paste in pastries before, and they were a big hit with our guests. I'm always looking for ways to bring a unique twist to classic desserts.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Keep up the good work, B. Our guests love the beautiful and delicious pastries you create.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It's a pleasure working here at this beautiful hotel and being able to serve our guests with the best of both worlds - Western and local flavors!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c268e9be-0143-4cce-898c-20b49f72c54d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
