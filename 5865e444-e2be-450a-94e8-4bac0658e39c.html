Look at the new snack products on display. What do you think of the market trend?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Yeah, they seem really interesting. I think the market trend is moving towards healthy snacks.<p class=message>Yes, you're right. Many people are becoming more health-conscious, so they're looking for healthier options.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! That's why we need to make sure our product fits that trend, but at the same time, also offers a unique selling point.<p class=message>For sure. I'm thinking about adding some exotic flavors to our products, like wasabi or sriracha. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That sounds great! Unique flavors definitely catch consumers' attention. We should also think about packaging, as that plays a huge role in attracting consumers to pick up our products.<p class=message>You're absolutely right. The packaging has to be eye-catching and easy to distinguish. Maybe we can use bright colors and bold font on the packaging.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we can also include some fun facts about the product on the packaging. That could make our product stand out even more.<p class=message>That's a fantastic idea! We can appeal to consumers' curiosity and make them want to try our product.<p class="message sent">Exactly! And we should also make sure to have a good balance of price and quality. Consumers are looking for value for money.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's make sure our product is reasonably priced but also maintains a high quality. That way, we can cater to a wider range of consumers.<p class="message sent">This will surely help us win the race in the market. Combining innovative flavors, catchy packaging, and affordable pricing will get us a lot of customers.<p class=message>I'm excited to put all these ideas into action. Thanks for your help in brainstorming, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Always happy to collaborate and come up with great ideas.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=585f2d46-bf92-4faa-bea9-1a3b4945c4d2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
