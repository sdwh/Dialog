How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing great, thanks. How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. So, what new desserts have you come up with recently?<p class="message sent">I've been experimenting with a durian-flavored ice cream. It's been quite popular with our customers.<p class=message>Durian? That's a unique flavor. I'm sure some people love it and others hate it.<p class="message sent">That's true, but it's always worth trying new things. What about you, A? Have you thought of any new dim sum dishes?<p class=message>Actually, we just started serving a new dish called "Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf". It's been getting great reviews so far.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds delicious. I'll have to try it sometime. Do you need help with anything else in the kitchen?<p class=message>Actually, could you make some more of your famous egg tarts? We're running low on those.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A. I'll get right on it. By the way, have you seen the new restaurant that just opened up down the street?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I heard it's a Korean barbecue place.<p class="message sent">That's right. We should check it out one of these days. It's always good to try different cuisines.<p class=message>I absolutely agree. Maybe we can even collaborate and create a fusion dish together.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I can't wait to see what we can come up with. Speaking of collaborations, do you have any plans for the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival?<p class=message>Yes, we're actually planning on hosting a mooncake-making workshop for our customers. Would you like to be a part of it?<p class="message sent">That sounds like so much fun! Count me in.<p class=message>Great! Let's make it happen. And while we're at it, let's grab a cup of tea and taste test some of our new creations.<p class="message sent">I'm always down for a cup of tea and some dessert. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e3630224-6709-42f3-b601-4e1c66b4e16d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
