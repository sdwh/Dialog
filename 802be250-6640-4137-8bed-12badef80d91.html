They're so funny!<p class=message>Yeah, cartoons are always hilarious. When I was your age, I loved watching Tom and Jerry.<p class="message sent">Tom and Jerry? I think I've heard about that show. Is it still on TV?<p class=message>No, it's not aired anymore. But it's a classic. You should watch it someday.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll try to find it online. But right now, I love watching these new cartoons.<p class=message>That's great son. Some of these new cartoons are really good. Which ones do you like the most?<p class="message sent">I really like this one about a group of animals who live in a forest. They always have adventures together.<p class=message>Oh, you mean the one with the bear, the rabbit, and the squirrel? That's a great one. I love watching it with you.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's so much fun to watch together. Hey dad, can we make some popcorn and watch a few more episodes?<p class=message>Of course we can! Let's make it a movie night. We can watch some of my old favorite movies too.<p class="message sent">Awesome! I can't wait. Let me go get the popcorn and you can pick out the movies.<p class=message>Alright, sounds like a plan. Let's go make some memories together.<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it! Thanks, dad!<p class=message>Anytime, son. I love spending time with you.<p class="message sent">I love spending time with you too, dad.
