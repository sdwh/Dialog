How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Oh, we're feeling good. How about you, A?<p class=message>I'm feeling great, thanks. Let's get started with today's rehearsal.<p class="message sent">Yeah, let's do it. What are we working on first?<p class=message>I was thinking we could start with "Sweet Caroline" and then move on to "Livin' on a Prayer."<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Can we also work on "Don't Stop Believin'"?<p class=message>Of course. It's one of our classics. Let's get the instruments set up.<p class="message sent">Hey, while we're at it, can we add "Bohemian Rhapsody" to the list too?<p class=message>Absolutely. It's a challenging one, but we're up for it. Alright, let's start with "Sweet Caroline."<p class="message sent">Hey, A. Do you think we should add some new tunes to our repertoire?<p class=message>Yeah, I was actually thinking the same thing. Any suggestions?<p class="message sent">How about "Uptown Funk"?<p class=message>Oh yeah, it's a fun one. Let's jot that down. What about "Shape of You"?<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's a crowd-pleaser. And how about "Girls Like You"?<p class=message>Yes, let's add that too. Alright, let's try "Livin' on a prayer" again.<p class="message sent">Hey A, did you hear that the bar down the street is looking for a band to perform on their anniversary?<p class=message>Oh, that's great news. Let's make sure we're prepared for that gig. Alright, let's wrap up for today.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. We made good progress today.<p class=message>No problem. See you guys next time.
