Is this your first time visiting the Statue of Liberty?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! I'm so excited to be here.<p class=message>Great! You picked a fantastic day to come. The weather is perfect for photos with the statue in the background.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I can't wait to take a bunch of photos to show my family and friends.<p class=message>Well, you're in luck. The line for the crown is shorter than usual today, if you'd like to go up for a bird's eye view.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing! How many steps do we have to climb?<p class=message>Just over 350 steps, but it's definitely worth it for the views.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's do it!<p class=message>Great, let me lead you over to the entrance. And after that, we can take some awesome photos at the base of the statue.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! Thank you so much for your help and for being a great guide.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. I love showing people around the city, especially when they're as excited as you are.<p class="message sent">You've been amazing so far. Do you have any recommendations for other spots we should check out while we're in New York?<p class=message>Sure do! Have you been to Central Park yet? It's a must-see and perfect for a relaxing picnic.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't been yet. That sounds like a great idea!<p class=message>Glad to hear it. And if you're looking to do some shopping, I highly recommend browsing the Chelsea Market.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for the tips. I can't wait to explore even more of this amazing city!<p class=message>My pleasure! And remember, if you have any more questions or need any help, don't hesitate to ask me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1ad878fb-dac4-45d1-9b55-edab46b3ea6f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
