It's all about evaluating and managing security risks in an organization, right?<p class=message>That's right. And did you know that getting certified in this can increase a company's reputation for security?<p class="message sent">Really? I need to let my boss know about this. So, how does it work?<p class=message>Well, it follows a structured approach for identifying and assessing risk, and then implementing controls to manage them.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a lot of work...<p class=message>It can be, but it's definitely worth it. I mean, who doesn't want stronger security measures for their business?<p class="message sent">True, especially with all the cyber attacks happening. Do you know what kind of risks they assess?<p class=message>They look at things like unauthorized access, hardware and software failures, and natural disasters, just to name a few.<p class="message sent">Yikes, it's scary to think about all the ways our data could be compromised.<p class=message>It is. But with the ISO 27001, companies can be confident in their risk management practices and protect themselves from threats.<p class="message sent">Do you know if there are any specific requirements for getting certified?<p class=message>Yes, there are certain policies and procedures that need to be in place, as well as regular audits to ensure everything is up to date.<p class="message sent">Got it. Well, I'm definitely going to bring this up to my team. Thanks for the info!<p class=message>No problem. Always happy to talk about security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7f1f90bd-f9cf-4ab6-93de-f966cb3216b5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
