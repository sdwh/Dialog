It's a great way to explore the city and hear different stories.<p class=message>That's very interesting. How long have you been driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">I've been a taxi driver for about 5 years now.<p class=message>Wow, you must have some crazy stories to tell. Any favorites?<p class="message sent">One time, I picked up a woman who was heading to the airport but forgot her passport. We had to turn around and rush back to her apartment to get it. We made it just in time for her flight!<p class=message>Haha, that's quite the adventure. Thanks for sharing. We're almost in Madrid now.<p class="message sent">Yes, we are. It was a pleasure meeting you, Sarah. Have a great time in Madrid!<p class=message>Thank you, Tom. I appreciate the ride and the conversation.
