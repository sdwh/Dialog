I'm your driver today. Where would you like to go?<p class=message>I'm off to Perth, Australia for vacation. Have you been there?<p class="message sent">Oh, I haven't, sir. I've only been to Melbourne and Sydney. How about you? Is it your first time?<p class=message>No, actually, I've been there a couple of times. I love the beaches there.<p class="message sent">That sounds lovely, sir. I'm a devout fisherman myself. Would you mind me asking if you've ever tried fishing there?<p class=message>Yes, I've tried it once. But to be honest, I'm really not good at it.<p class="message sent">No worries, sir! Fishing is all about enjoying the experience. Maybe you can try again next time you'll be visiting.<p class=message>That's a great idea. By the way, do you have any good local restaurant recommendations?<p class="message sent">Oh, there's this one seafood grill place that I would highly recommend. The food is amazing!<p class=message>Really? Can you give me the name and address?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, sir! It's called "Grill'd & Fried" and it's located just a few blocks off the beach.<p class=message>Thanks a lot! I'll have to check it out. By the way, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for about 15 years now. It's a tough job, but I really enjoy meeting new people like you.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Any tips you can give me for my trip to Perth?<p class="message sent">Of course, sir! Just be prepared for sunny days and lots of outdoor activities. And make sure to visit the Perth Zoo, it's a must-see!<p class=message>Awesome. Thanks again for the suggestions, and for being so friendly!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, sir! It's always a pleasure to have a nice conversation with a passenger. Have a great trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=85fccc11-0c04-4740-8d74-6a3c04d4d5e9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
