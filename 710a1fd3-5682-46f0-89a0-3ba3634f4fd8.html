What game are you playing?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I'm playing Chinese Chess. Do you wanna join me?<p class=message>I haven't played this game before, but I am willing to give it a try.<p class="message sent">Great! Let me teach you how to play it. Do you know how the pieces move?<p class=message>Not really. I only know that there is a king, a queen, and some soldiers.<p class="message sent">That’s correct. The game is played on a 9x10 board, and each player has 16 pieces. The king, also known as the general, is the most important piece as the goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent's general.<p class=message>I see. So how do the pieces move?<p class="message sent">The pieces all move differently. For example, the general moves one space at a time within the palace walls, and the pawns can only move one step forward after the first move.<p class=message>Ah, I think I'm starting to get it. This seems like a really strategic game.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. It's a game where you have to think ahead and anticipate your opponent's moves.<p class=message>That sounds like it could be challenging. But, it also sounds like a lot of fun.<p class="message sent">Definitely! It's a great game to test your skills.<p class=message>I’m feeling a bit nervous, but let's start the game. You can go first.<p class="message sent">Sure. Let's see who's the better player!<p class=message>Haha, alright! May the best player win!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7105798d-802e-47de-9c16-6797801dd3f4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
