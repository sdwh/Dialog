Nice to see you on Steam.<p class="message sent">Hey, glad to have you as a friend. What game are you playing?<p class=message>I'm currently playing Among Us. Have you played it?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've played it a few times. It's pretty fun. Do you want to play together?<p class=message>Sure, let's give it a go. Have you been imposter yet?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. It's really tough trying to convince everyone you're innocent.<p class=message>Haha yeah, it definitely takes some skill. So what's the craziest thing that's ever happened to you in this game?<p class="message sent">Well, I remember I was the imposter once and I accidentally killed someone in front of another crewmate. I started panicking but somehow I was able to talk my way out of it.<p class=message>That's impressive. I'm still trying to master the art of deception in this game.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. Have you tried any other games on Steam?<p class=message>I've played a ton, but my all-time favorite has to be Stardew Valley. It's such a relaxing game.<p class="message sent">Oh, I've heard of that one. I might have to check it out. You have good taste in games.<p class=message>Thanks! I try to discover hidden gems whenever I can. Have you found any lately?<p class="message sent">Yeah, actually, there's this game called Hades that I recently started playing. It's been really addictive.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard great things about that one. I might have to give it a try myself.<p class="message sent">Yeah, definitely check it out. It's great to have you as a Steam friend, by the way.<p class=message>Likewise! It's always nice to connect with fellow gamers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=75598f94-e0e6-4e1d-89f8-6d721cfcc3c3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
