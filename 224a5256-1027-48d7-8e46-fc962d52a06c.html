I’m a cargo representative from XYZ Airlines. Are you in charge of the cargo handling here?<p class="message sent">Yes, nice to meet you! I’m a cargo handler at this airport. How can I assist you today?<p class=message>We’ve recently upgraded our cargo operation system and we were wondering if we could work with your team to streamline the cargo handling process at this airport.<p class="message sent">That’s great to hear! We’re always looking for ways to improve our efficiency. What changes have you made to the system?<p class=message>We’ve improved our tracking and tracing system, and now we even have e-airway bills. It’ll save time and reduce the need for paperwork.<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic! Having electronic documentation can definitely reduce the potential for human errors. How does it work?<p class=message>It’s pretty simple. Our cargo team would send an electronic airway bill to your system beforehand. Then, your cargo handlers can just scan the barcode on the bill and that would pull up all the necessary details.<p class="message sent">I see, that definitely makes things a lot smoother. Do you have any more upgrades planned for the system?<p class=message>We’re also looking into incorporating AI technology to help with sorting and loading the cargo. The idea is to have automated systems that can optimize the space and weight distribution.<p class="message sent">Wow, that’s impressive! I can see how that would save a considerable amount of time and effort. Do you think that’ll happen anytime soon?<p class=message>We’re still in the research stage, but we hope to implement it in the next year or two. We’ll definitely keep you updated!<p class="message sent">Please do! It’s always exciting to learn about new technologies and improvements we can make to the cargo handling process. Thanks for sharing this with me today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=224922ee-480b-41c4-9749-255b30c71741.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
