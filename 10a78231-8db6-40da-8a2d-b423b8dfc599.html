How about your hotdog stand?<p class=message>Can't complain, people are always up for a good hotdog! Say, want to try one out?<p class="message sent">Actually, I've been eyeing that chili cheese dog all day. Mind if I grab one?<p class=message>Of course not! I'll even throw in a free soda for you.<p class="message sent">Thanks so much! Hey, do you have any recommendations for a good ice cream flavor?<p class=message>Personally, I like the classic vanilla, but our strawberry and chocolate are also popular.<p class="message sent">I think I'll go for a scoop of strawberry. You know what they say, "strawberry in the summer keeps the heat away!"<p class=message>Ha, that's a good one! You should put that on a sign.<p class="message sent">Maybe I will! So tell me, how did you end up running a hotdog stand?<p class=message>It's a family business actually. My grandfather started it years ago and it's been passed down to me. I just love seeing people's faces light up when they take that first bite.<p class="message sent">I can imagine! I feel the same way when someone takes a scoop of my ice cream. There's something about food that just brings people together and makes them happy.<p class=message>Absolutely! That's why I think our businesses work so well together. We provide that perfect pairing of savory and sweet.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Speaking of which, I think I'll grab another hotdog to go with my ice cream. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. And thanks for being such a great partner in this street block. Here's to a delicious summer!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=109fc40e-2358-4e83-a373-12d222aecb3e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
