How's the audit going?<p class="message sent">All good so far. Thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I think we're on track. By the way, what's your favorite part about being a database manager?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough question. I guess it's the satisfaction of solving problems and optimizing data access.<p class=message>That sounds challenging and exciting at the same time. Speaking of excitement, have you ever encountered any funny or bizarre data entries?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We once found a record where the password was set as "12345678." Not the best practice, right?<p class=message>(laughs) Definitely not. It's funny how some people think that's a secure password.<p class="message sent">Indeed. And another time we found a record with a customer's name listed as "Mickey Mouse." I wonder who that was.<p class=message>(laughs) Maybe someone with a good sense of humor. Hey, have you ever accidentally deleted a database?<p class="message sent">Oh, no. Knock on wood! But it's a common nightmare among managers.<p class=message>(laughs) Yeah, it's definitely something to avoid. By the way, I heard you're a big fan of superhero movies. Who's your favorite superhero?<p class="message sent">Oh, I love Iron Man. He's intelligent, confident, and has a great sense of humor.<p class=message>Nice choice. Do you think he'd make a good IT manager?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Definitely. With his technological expertise, he could be a great asset to any company.<p class=message>(laughs) I couldn't agree more. Well, let's get back to our audit. Keep up the good work, my friend.<p class="message sent">Same to you. Let's keep this database secure and optimized!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=68ace8ef-511b-4633-9eb7-3c0eb2b339b8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
