How's it going with the grill?<p class="message sent">It's going well, sir. The meat is cooking nicely.<p class=message>That's great to hear. How's the stir-fry coming along?<p class="message sent">We're making good progress there too, sir. The vegetables are almost done.<p class=message>Wonderful! We're going to have some really happy customers today.<p class="message sent">Speaking of customers, have you seen those two guys in the corner? They look like food critics.<p class=message>Oh no! I hope we're doing everything right.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, sir. We're doing great. And it's not every day you get a chance to impress some critics.<p class=message>You're right about that. Maybe we'll end up in the newspapers.<p class="message sent">Or on social media. Everyone loves to share their opinions these days.<p class=message>(chuckles) That's true. But let's focus on the cooking for now. We don't want to disappoint anyone.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, sir. We'll make sure everything is perfect.<p class=message>By the way, have you tried the new grill seasoning we got in?<p class="message sent">Not yet, sir. Is it any good?<p class=message>It's amazing! I tried it on some chicken last night and it was so flavorful.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious. I can't wait to try it on some beef.<p class=message>You'll love it. Just make sure you don't overdo it.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I'll keep that in mind, sir.<p class=message>You're a great chef, B. I'm lucky to have you on the team.<p class="message sent">Thank you, sir. I'm honored to work here. It's always a pleasure to cook for our happy customers.<p class=message>That's the spirit! Let's keep up the good work and make today a success.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e546093-9ca0-415b-89db-6e22c9cfec84.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
