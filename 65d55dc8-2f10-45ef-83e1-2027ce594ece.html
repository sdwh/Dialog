It's so nice to see our little dessert shop looking so lovely today.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A! Your cakes are amazing. I'm always impressed by your creativity.<p class=message>I have to admit, it's the customers who inspire me! Speaking of which, have you tried our new lemon-lavender cake?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't! How is it?<p class=message>It's light and refreshing, with just a hint of floral flavor. The lemon frosting is the perfect complement.<p class="message sent">That does sound tempting. I should try a slice for myself.<p class=message>You absolutely should. And speaking of tempting treats, have you made any new additions to your menu lately?<p class="message sent">As a matter of fact, I have. I just introduced a new peach cobbler that's been flying off the shelves.<p class=message>Oh, I love peach cobbler. Is it a family recipe?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's been in the family for generations. We use fresh peaches and a flaky crust that crumbles in your mouth.<p class=message>You're making me hungry just thinking about it. Do you think we could have a dessert exchange sometime? You bring your cobbler and I'll bring my lemon-lavender cake.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea, A! I think our customers would love it. And maybe we could even do a collaborative dessert in the future.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's always fun to collaborate with other dessert enthusiasts. We could call it "The Sweet Alliance."<p class="message sent">I like it! We'd be unstoppable. And who knows, maybe one day we could open up a chain of dessert shops together.<p class=message>Now you're talking! Our little shop in Olympia is just the beginning. The world is our oyster. Or should I say, our lemon-lavender cake?<p class="message sent">(laughs) The possibilities are endless, A. Let's keep dreaming and making delicious desserts together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=65c915cc-20f1-46a3-89bc-e8e9c6518efa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
