Looks like you're new to these parts. Here for some fishing?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I heard there are some amazing fish species in these waters.<p class=message>You bet there are! Have you tried your luck yet?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. I was waiting to see if any locals could give me some tips.<p class=message>Well, you're in luck. I've been fishing these waters for years. What kind of fish are you looking to catch?<p class="message sent">I was hoping to catch some barramundi or maybe a mackerel.<p class=message>Excellent choices! The secret to catching those is to use some live bait. I usually use sardines, they seem to work well.<p class="message sent">Great, thanks for the advice. By the way, what's the best time of day to fish here?<p class=message>Early morning or late afternoon seem to be the best times. But don't take my word for it, fishing can be unpredictable sometimes.<p class="message sent">I see what you mean. So, have you caught any big fish recently?<p class=message>Actually, just last week I caught a huge barramundi, weighed about 40 pounds!<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive! Have you won any fishing competitions?<p class=message>I've won a few local ones. But I mostly fish for fun, not for the trophies.<p class="message sent">That's great. It's important to enjoy the experience of fishing. And by the way, how's the weather looking for the rest of the day?<p class=message>It should be good, plenty of sunshine and a gentle breeze. Perfect fishing weather, if you ask me.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. Thanks for all the tips and advice, I'm looking forward to trying my luck now.<p class=message>No worries mate, happy fishing! And don't forget to enjoy the scenery, this beach is one of the prettiest in Queensland.<p class="message sent">Will do, thanks again for everything. Catch you later.<p class=message>Cheers, have a good one!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6caaa92f-4ed6-418e-8895-ab8da9b7637f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
