I heard you're working on a new puzzle game. Can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Sure thing. It's called 'The Great Escape.' Players have to solve a series of escape room puzzles to unlock the exit door.<p class=message>Sounds exciting! Can you give me an example of one of the puzzles?<p class="message sent">Sure! One of them involves finding hidden objects and using them to unlock a safe that contains a key to the next room.<p class=message>That sounds challenging. I love challenging games though. What kind of graphics are you using?<p class="message sent">We're going for a vintage, steampunk vibe with a lot of brass, wood, and gears. We want players to feel like they're in an old-fashioned escape room.<p class=message>I love that aesthetic! What platforms will it be available on?<p class="message sent">It will be available on mobile devices and desktop computers.<p class=message>Sweet! What's the target audience for the game?<p class="message sent">It's aimed at anyone who loves puzzle games and escape rooms, but we're hoping it appeals to a wide demographic.<p class=message>What's the storyline behind the game?<p class="message sent">There isn't a storyline per se, but players will feel like they're trapped in a mysterious, Victorian-era mansion and have to use their wits to escape.<p class=message>That sounds intriguing. When will it be released?<p class="message sent">If all goes well, we're hoping to release it in about six months.<p class=message>I can't wait to try it out! Thanks for telling me about it.<p class="message sent">No problem, thanks for your interest, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=482c7654-31f3-4a39-ae2b-25599d2a1c89.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
