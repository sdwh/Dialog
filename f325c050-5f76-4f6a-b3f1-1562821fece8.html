Let's get cooking.<p class="message sent">Yes, chef! What's on the menu tonight?<p class=message>We have a selection of grilled salmon, roasted chicken, and vegetarian lasagna.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! What do you recommend?<p class=message>The roasted chicken is definitely our specialty, but the grilled salmon has been a hit lately.<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough decision. Maybe I'll have to try both!<p class=message>Now that's what I like to hear. Let's get started on the chicken first.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. What can I do to help?<p class=message>Could you prep the vegetables for the side dish? And maybe start boiling some potatoes?<p class="message sent">On it. How many servings do we need?<p class=message>We have reservations for 20, so let's prep for 25 just in case.<p class="message sent">Got it. This chicken smells amazing. How much longer until it's done?<p class=message>About 10 more minutes in the oven. In the meantime, let's get started on the salmon.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Do you want me to start marinating the fish?<p class=message>Yes, please. Here's the recipe. And while you're at it, could you put some bread in the oven?<p class="message sent">Of course. This is going to be a feast!<p class=message>Agreed. And it's all thanks to you, my trusty assistant.<p class="message sent">Happy to help, chef. Anything else you need me to do?<p class=message>Just keep an eye on everything and let me know if there's anything we're running low on.<p class="message sent">Will do. Can't wait to see the customers' reactions!<p class=message>Me too. Let's make tonight a night to remember!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f324742b-0584-48bc-825f-b9ae770ec398.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
