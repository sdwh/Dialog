How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey! Everything's great. I'm excited to be here and see the progress on our building.<p class=message>Yes, we've been making some great strides. I'm really excited about the direction we're headed.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. So, let's get down to business. What do you have in mind for the exterior design?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of incorporating some greenery onto the facade. Maybe a living wall or some hanging plants.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! It would definitely make the building stand out.<p class=message>Exactly! And it's also environmentally-friendly.<p class="message sent">I like that. And what about the interior? Any ideas on how to make it more inviting?<p class=message>I was thinking of adding some natural light sources, like skylights or more windows. And maybe some comfy seating areas for people to relax.<p class="message sent">I'm on board with that. We want our tenants to feel comfortable and happy.<p class=message>Definitely. Oh, and speaking of tenants, have you thought about any potential art installations or murals for the lobby?<p class="message sent">Yes! I was actually just talking to a local artist who I think would be perfect for the job.<p class=message>That's amazing. Connecting with the local community is really important to me.<p class="message sent">I agree. We want our building to be a part of the community, not just another structure.<p class=message>Yes, and speaking of community, have you thought about any amenities for the tenants? Like a rooftop garden or fitness center?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I was thinking about incorporating a rooftop garden with a bar and grill area.<p class=message>That sounds fantastic. Our tenants will love that.<p class="message sent">Yes, and it will also be a great way to bring people together.<p class=message>Definitely. I'm really excited about this project and the potential it has.<p class="message sent">Me too. I think we're going to create something special here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4eccf1a7-1306-47ca-9c5e-461113b5ffdd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
