Nice to meet you, B. So, how are things going with the car?<p class="message sent">Hey A! Nice to meet you too. Yeah, we have a few issues to take care of. But nothing too serious. Just some minor adjustments.<p class=message>Great to hear that. I hope we can get this car back on track as soon as possible.<p class="message sent">No worries, mate. We're quite the dream team, aren't we? By the way, did you catch the game last night?<p class=message>Of course, I did! What a thriller, huh? I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.<p class="message sent">Tell me about it! What a game! My team won though. How about yours?<p class=message>Sadly, mine lost. But, we'll bounce back stronger.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit! Same goes for our car, we'll fix it up and make it even better.<p class=message>Yeah, can't wait to get back on the race track. So, what exactly is the issue with the car?<p class="message sent">Well, the transmission seems to be a bit off, and we need to replace the suspension. But, I assure you, it'll be good as new in no time.<p class=message>You're a lifesaver, B. I couldn't have asked for a better mechanic.<p class="message sent">Aw, thanks A! I'm flattered. You're not too bad yourself, you know. The way you handle the car, it's like it's an extension of your body.<p class=message>Ha ha! That's quite the compliment, coming from someone of your expertise.<p class="message sent">Well, it's true! We make a great team.<p class=message>Absolutely! And, once we win this race, we'll celebrate like there's no tomorrow!<p class="message sent">You bet! Let's get the work done first, and then we'll party hard!<p class=message>Sounds like a plan, my friend. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=774b2a89-63ce-4495-bf1f-34b20ada0369.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
