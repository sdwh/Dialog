Thanks for joining me for this interview. Can I offer you a coffee?<p class="message sent">Thank you. I'll have a cappuccino please.<p class=message>Great choice. So, what made you decide to start your own business?<p class="message sent">Well, I've always had a passion for entrepreneurship and I saw a gap in the market for my product.<p class=message>That's interesting. What's the biggest challenge you've faced so far?<p class="message sent">Managing my time effectively. There's always so much to do and never enough hours in the day.<p class=message>I know the feeling! So, what's the most rewarding part of running your own business?<p class="message sent">Seeing my vision become a reality and the positive feedback from satisfied customers.<p class=message>That's fantastic. So, what advice would you give to someone who's thinking about starting their own business?<p class="message sent">Be prepared to work hard and stay focused on your goals. And don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.<p class=message>Wise words indeed. Now, on a lighter note, what's your favourite way to unwind after a long day at work?<p class="message sent">I love to go for a run or hit the gym. It helps me to clear my head and de-stress.<p class=message>That's a great way to stay healthy and relax. Okay, last question - if you could have any superpower, what would it be?<p class="message sent">Hmm, tough one. I think I'd choose the ability to teleport. It would make travel so much easier!<p class=message>I can imagine. Well, that's all we have time for today. Thanks for chatting with me.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me. It was a pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed744a6b-eaf9-47eb-abde-3083389ee494.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
