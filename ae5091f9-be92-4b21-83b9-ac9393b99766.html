How are you doing today, B?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks for asking. And you? Ready to make some delicious traditional Chinese breakfast?<p class=message>Of course! I have all my ingredients ready. How about you?<p class="message sent">My soybeans have been soaked overnight and ready to have some soy milk extracted.<p class=message>Sounds great. I can already smell the freshly made chao bing piercing through the air.<p class="message sent">And I can't wait to pour some piping hot soy milk to accompany them.<p class=message>Hey, do you remember the time when the dough just wouldn't cooperate no matter how much we tried?<p class="message sent">Oh, that was a nightmare. But we laughed so hard at our own failed attempts.<p class=message>Haha, I still remember our dough throwing contest.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that was hilarious. Did you know that in China, chao bing is often eaten with fried dough sticks?<p class=message>Really? That's interesting. Maybe we should try it someday.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And did you know that soy milk has numerous health benefits, including reducing cholesterol levels?<p class=message>Wow, I had no idea. I'll remember to spread the word to our customers.<p class="message sent">I think we make a great team, A.<p class=message>Indeed we do, B. Together, we provide authentic Chinese breakfast to our customers in Osaka.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ae500133-ba39-48e4-8e93-90873e60e4be.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
