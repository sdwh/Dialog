How about you?<p class=message>Not too bad, just trying to wrap my head around some of the ISO 27001 requirements.<p class="message sent">Yeah, those can definitely be a bit overwhelming at first. But once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I'm just going over our access control policies and procedures now. Anything I should keep in mind?<p class="message sent">Well, one thing to remember is that access control isn't just about who can access what. It's also about monitoring and recording access, so we can identify any potential security breaches.<p class=message>Ah, I see. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the tip.<p class="message sent">No problem. And if you have any questions or need any help along the way, don't hesitate to ask.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate that. How did you get into system administration, by the way?<p class="message sent">It's a bit of a long story, but the short version is that I've always been interested in technology and how systems work. I started tinkering with computers at a young age, and it just kind of snowballed from there.<p class=message>That's really cool. I've always admired people who have a natural talent for that kind of stuff.<p class="message sent">Thanks, it definitely takes a certain mindset to be good at it. But it's also a lot of fun and very rewarding.<p class=message>Yeah, I can imagine. Well, I better get back to this audit. Thanks again for the help.<p class="message sent">No problem, good luck with everything! And remember, if you need anything, don't hesitate to reach out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=40892920-0207-4a74-91b5-e7176f9ee721.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
