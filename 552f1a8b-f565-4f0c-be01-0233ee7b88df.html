B, would you like to go first?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A. Yesterday, I was working on fixing a bug in the login feature. It took some time but I finally managed to get it sorted out.<p class=message>That's great to hear, B. Did any new tickets come in?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. We received a request for a feature that allows users to customize their profile pages. I'll be working on that today.<p class=message>Perfect, thanks for letting us know. As for me, I've been doing some user research to figure out what new features we can add to our product. I also had a call with a potential client yesterday.<p class="message sent">Any interesting feedback from users or the client?<p class=message>Definitely. Users seem to really want a dark mode feature, and the client was interested in integrating our product with their CRM system.<p class="message sent">Dark mode? That's interesting. I actually prefer lighter interfaces myself.<p class=message>Really? I'm a big fan of dark mode, it's easier on the eyes.<p class="message sent">Fair enough. Have you seen any memes about people who only use dark mode and how they're supposedly more productive?<p class=message>Haha, yes, I have. Maybe we should add that to our marketing materials.<p class="message sent">I like the way you think! But seriously, integrating with a CRM system could be a big selling point for our product.<p class=message>Definitely. Okay, let's wrap up the meeting. B, keep us posted on your progress with the user customization feature. And everyone, let's aim to wrap up our tasks for the week by Friday. Sound good?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, thanks A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=552ed0df-0118-4c6f-b360-ff614067e22e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
