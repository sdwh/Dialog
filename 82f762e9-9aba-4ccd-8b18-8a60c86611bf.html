Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today to discuss my book manuscript.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. I'm excited to read through your latest work. How's it coming along?<p class=message>It's been a bit of a challenge, but I think I'm finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just have a few more chapters to finish up before I'm ready to send it to you.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I always love reading your work. Speaking of which, have you come up with a title yet?<p class=message>Actually, I have a few ideas, but I wanted to get your opinion on them. How about "Love in the Time of COVID" or "The Quarantine Chronicles"?<p class="message sent">Both of those sound interesting, but I think "The Quarantine Chronicles" has a really catchy ring to it. Let's go with that.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. So, what do you think of the character development so far?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I think you've done a fantastic job. The main character is relatable and the supporting characters all have their own unique personalities.<p class=message>Thank you. I put a lot of effort into making sure each character had their own voice.<p class="message sent">It really shows. I also appreciate how you tackled some heavy topics in a lighthearted way. It's an important message to share, especially during these tough times.<p class=message>Thank you so much! I'm really happy to hear you say that. I just hope readers will enjoy it as much as we do.<p class="message sent">I have no doubt they will. Is there anything else we should go over before we finalize everything?<p class=message>Just a few minor edits, but I'll have those to you by the end of the week. Other than that, I think we're all set!<p class="message sent">Perfect. I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product. Thanks for meeting with me today, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Thank you for your continued support and feedback. Have a good rest of your day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=82f38198-37fe-478e-8f2f-a56d9e9812e1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
