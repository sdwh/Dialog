How's business tonight?<p class="message sent">It's been pretty busy, A. Lots of people looking for a good drink after work.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I hope they're all leaving happy.<p class="message sent">I've had a few compliments on the cocktails tonight, so I think we're doing well.<p class=message>Excellent. Do you have any recommendations for me to try?<p class="message sent">Sure, how about a classic Old Fashioned or a refreshing Mojito?<p class=message>Hmm, I think I'll try the Mojito. Can you make it extra minty?<p class="message sent">Of course, I can muddle extra mint leaves in there for you.<p class=message>Fantastic, thank you. How long have you been a bartender?<p class="message sent">I've been bartending for about ten years now. It's a great job if you enjoy meeting new people and being creative.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. What's the craziest drink request you've ever had?<p class="message sent">I once had someone request a cocktail made with beer, carrots, and hot sauce. Needless to say, it wasn't very good.<p class=message>(laughs) That's definitely a unique combination. Have you ever had any celebrity customers?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've had a few athletes and actors come in for a drink. They were all very nice and didn't cause any trouble.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Well, my Mojito is delicious. I'll have to come back and try some of your other cocktails.<p class="message sent">Glad you enjoyed it, A. Thanks for visiting us tonight.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aebf63ff-4f9e-4b79-8d01-2483b9f82d53.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
