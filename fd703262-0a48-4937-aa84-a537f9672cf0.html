Can you take me to Manila?<p class="message sent">Of course, sir. Just buckle up and we'll be on our way!<p class=message>Thanks! So, what's the traffic like today?<p class="message sent">It's a bit busy, but nothing we can't handle. I've got some music if you want to listen to something?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds great! What kind of music do you like?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of classic rock. How about you?<p class=message>I like a bit of everything. But, I've been listening to a lot of jazz lately.<p class="message sent">Nice! Who's your favorite jazz artist?<p class=message>I'd have to say it's Louis Armstrong. How about you?<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm a huge fan of Miles Davis. He really changed the game in jazz.<p class=message>Yeah, his trumpet playing is legendary. So, how long have you been a cab driver?<p class="message sent">For about 5 years now. I like meeting new people and driving around the city.<p class=message>That's great! You seem like a friendly guy.<p class="message sent">Thanks, sir! I try to be. Speaking of friendly, have you had a chance to try any of the local restaurants here in Manila?<p class=message>Not yet, actually. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely! You should try the chicken adobo at this place I know. It's amazing.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard about adobo, but haven't tried it yet. Thanks for the tip!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, sir! It's my pleasure to share my love for our city and its cuisine.<p class=message>I appreciate it. It's always great to travel and learn new things.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! That's one of the joys of life. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, sir. We'll be in Manila soon enough.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fd6bd6ea-0594-441c-8ba1-4398eaaed101.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
