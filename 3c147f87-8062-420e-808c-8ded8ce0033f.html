What's that about?<p class=message>Well, it's a security standard that helps prevent unauthorized access to computer systems.<p class="message sent">Ah, okay. That sounds interesting. Do you know how it works?<p class=message>Basically, it monitors network traffic and identifies any suspicious behavior.<p class="message sent">Oh, so like a security guard for your computer system.<p class=message>Exactly! And it can send alerts to the system administrator if it detects any potential threats.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like a useful tool to have. Have you ever used it before?<p class=message>No, but I've been reading up on it. I think it's something that more companies should consider implementing.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Security is such an important aspect of any business, especially in this day and age when cyber attacks are becoming more common.<p class=message>Absolutely. And the great thing about IDS is that it can be customized to fit the specific needs of a company.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. I'll have to do some research on it myself.<p class=message>Yeah, and if you need any help with it, I'd be happy to lend a hand.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate it! Maybe we can even implement it in our own workplace.<p class=message>That would be a great idea. We could help keep our company's data safe and secure.<p class="message sent">Yup, and it would give us some peace of mind knowing that we have an extra layer of protection.<p class=message>Definitely. So, are you ready to become IDS experts?<p class="message sent">Haha, let's not get ahead of ourselves. But I'm definitely willing to learn more about it.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. We can start by looking for some online resources and maybe even attending some seminars.<p class="message sent">That's a great plan. I'm excited to learn more and become more knowledgeable in this area.<p class=message>Me too! It's always good to expand our skills and knowledge base.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Thanks for bringing this to my attention, A. You're always full of good ideas!<p class=message>No problem, B. We've got this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3c103bbe-6f1f-4e71-a384-f2ffb3fb32cb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
