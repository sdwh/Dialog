Today we have with us a software engineer, B, who will be talking about the latest SQL Server technology.<p class="message sent">Hi A, thanks for having me. Yes, I'm excited to share with our listeners the latest updates in SQL Server 2019.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. So what are some of the new features we can expect from SQL Server 2019?<p class="message sent">Well, one of the biggest updates is the integration with Apache Spark and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). This makes it easier to process big data and build machine learning models.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a game-changer. Can you give an example of how this integration could benefit businesses?<p class="message sent">Sure. Let's say a company wants to analyze customer data and create targeted marketing campaigns. With the new SQL Server updates, they can easily combine customer data with external data sources and run machine learning algorithms to predict customer behavior.<p class=message>That's impressive. What are some other updates we can look forward to?<p class="message sent">Another big update is the enhanced security features. With SQL Server 2019, you can now use Always Encrypted with secure enclaves to protect sensitive data, and also control data access with row-level security.<p class=message>Very important for businesses that handle sensitive data. Is there anything else we should know about SQL Server 2019?<p class="message sent">Yes, there are also improvements in query performance, with features like Intelligent Query Processing and Accelerated Database Recovery. Plus, there are now more options for running SQL Server in containers, which helps with deployment and management.<p class=message>It seems like SQL Server 2019 has a lot to offer. Thank you, B, for sharing these updates with us today.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, thank you for having me on the show.<p class=message>And that's all we have time for today. Tune in next week for more exciting tech updates.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a459f6d2-b52f-4e17-bead-7f6a803f39c0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
