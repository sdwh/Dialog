Lots of customers coming in for our famous milk tea and bubble waffles.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've been busy cooking up all sorts of noodles for our customers. Have you tried any?<p class="message sent">Of course I have! I love your spicy beef noodle soup. It's always a perfect thing to warm me up on a chilly day.<p class=message>Thanks so much, B! Speaking of warm things, have you tried making our new hot honey lemon ginger tea?<p class="message sent">No, actually, I haven't! Do you think it's worth trying out?<p class=message>It's definitely worth it. It's been a hit with our customers, especially during cold and flu season.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll give it a try. So, have you tried any new recipes for our milk tea lately?<p class=message>Yes, actually, I've been experimenting with adding some fresh fruit purees to some teas to give them a whole new flavor profile. So far, it's been a hit with some customers.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. I think I'll try some for myself later.<p class=message>Of course, let me know what you think. Oh, and have you heard about the new dish we're planning to add to our menu?<p class="message sent">No, what is it?<p class=message>It's called mapo tofu noodles. It's a mix of our classic spicy noodles and the popular Sichuan dish, mapo tofu. I think it's going to be a big hit!<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious. I can't wait to try it. By the way, have we gotten any requests for gluten-free options lately?<p class=message>Yes, actually, we have. I'm thinking of adding some rice noodles to our menu as a gluten-free alternative.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We always want to make sure we can cater to all our customers' needs.<p class=message>Absolutely, B. It's important to keep evolving to keep our customers happy. Speaking of happy customers, have you seen the reviews for our shop online lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, they've been amazing. I'm so proud of the work we're doing here.<p class=message>Me too, B. We make a great team. Let's keep up the good work and keep serving up some delicious food and drinks!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=838646bd-467c-4e0f-9323-a65b079115d5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
