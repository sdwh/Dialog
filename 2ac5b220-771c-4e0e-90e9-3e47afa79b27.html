Have you had a chance to check out the latest vulnerability scan report?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing well, thanks for asking. Yeah, I went through the report yesterday. It looks like we have a few critical vulnerabilities that need to be addressed ASAP.<p class=message>That's not surprising. Did you notice any false positives or any findings that needed further verification?<p class="message sent">Yeah, there were a few findings that looked a bit suspect. I marked those for further investigation. But the rest of the findings looked legit.<p class=message>Great, let's prioritize the critical ones first and work on a plan to fix them. That way, we can eliminate any potential security risks.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm thinking we should start by patching up the vulnerable web application that we saw in the report. I already have a patch for that, so that shouldn't take too long.<p class=message>Nice work, B. Once we patch up the web application, we should move on to the other critical vulnerabilities. We can't take any chances when it comes to security.<p class="message sent">I hear you, A. But don't worry, we've got this. We'll make sure our systems are secure before anyone tries to exploit the vulnerabilities.<p class=message>That's the spirit, B. Speaking of vulnerabilities, did you hear about the recent ransomware attack on the hospital down the street?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did. It's crazy how these attacks are becoming more common. We need to stay vigilant and make sure our own systems are secure.<p class=message>Absolutely. We'll continue to work on staying ahead of the game, and hopefully, we won't fall victim to any attacks.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Well, it's been great discussing these vulnerabilities with you, A. I'm going to get started on patching up the web application. Catch you later!<p class=message>Take care, B. And great job on the patch.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2ac25f43-9f23-49ed-a735-03c4dc9c33d7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
