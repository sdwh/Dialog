What happened?<p class="message sent">I got into a car accident and the other driver is blaming me for it.<p class=message>Ok, let's talk about the details. Were there any witnesses?<p class="message sent">Yes, there were two witnesses who saw the accident. However, they have conflicting testimonies.<p class=message>That can complicate things. Do you have any evidence to support your case?<p class="message sent">I have some photos of the accident scene and a video recording from my dashboard camera.<p class=message>Those pieces of evidence could be helpful. Let's review them together.<p class="message sent">Alright, here they are. What do you think?<p class=message>Hmm, based on these, it looks like the other driver may have been at fault. I suggest we file a lawsuit against them.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good plan. Thank you for your help.<p class=message>No problem. Remember to keep all your receipts and medical bills related to the accident. We'll need those for the lawsuit.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eabfa3e4-e8b1-460c-9823-caa12326b16f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
