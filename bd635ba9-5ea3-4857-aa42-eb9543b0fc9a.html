What is it?<p class=message>It's a delicious soup that originated in Thailand. It's made with coconut milk, lemongrass, and chicken.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing. I love coconut milk in my soup.<p class=message>Yes, it's really flavorful and has a bit of a tangy kick to it.<p class="message sent">Is it spicy? Because my taste buds can't handle too much heat.<p class=message>Not really spicy, but it does have a little bit of heat to it. But don't worry, you can adjust the spice level to your preference.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. I hate when I order something and it's too spicy for me to enjoy.<p class=message>Trust me, you'll enjoy Tom Kha Gai. It's like a warm hug in a bowl.<p class="message sent">I'm sold. I'm definitely going to give it a try.<p class=message>You won't regret it. It's one of my favorite dishes. You can have it with rice, noodles or just on its own.<p class="message sent">I'm getting hungry just talking about it. Is there any good Thai restaurant nearby?<p class=message>Yeah, there's a great one just a few blocks away from here. Let's grab some lunch there today.<p class="message sent">Perfect, let's do it. I can't wait to try this Tom Kha Gai soup!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bd62646a-b231-407c-a4c5-0a6e73c11c1f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
