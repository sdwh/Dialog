What do you think about them?<p class=message>Personally, I find them pretty straightforward and easy to understand.<p class="message sent">Agreed, but there are a few policies that seem a bit too strict to me.<p class=message>Like which ones?<p class="message sent">The dress code policy, for one. It's like we're working at a fashion magazine or something.<p class=message>Haha, I guess the company wants us to put our best foot forward.<p class="message sent">Yeah, but it's kind of hard to be creative with your outfit when you have to wear a suit every day.<p class=message>I see your point. What about the attendance policy though? I think that one is pretty important.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Being punctual and reliable is essential to success in any business.<p class=message>Oh, and did you notice the new policy about social media usage during work hours?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. It's about time they addressed that issue. Some people were spending way too much time on their phones.<p class=message>Right? It's easy to get distracted by all the notifications and messages.<p class="message sent">But let's be honest, everyone needs a little break from work every now and then.<p class=message>True, but we have to be responsible and not let it affect our productivity.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Oh, speaking of which, do you know if there's a new policy on taking breaks?<p class=message>I think the break policy is pretty much the same as before. You get two 15-minute breaks and a 30-minute lunch break.<p class="message sent">Okay, thanks for clarifying that.<p class=message>No problem. Any other policies you want to discuss?<p class="message sent">Not really, I think we covered most of them.<p class=message>Alright then, let's get back to work and start implementing these new policies.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b33cbada-d3df-424d-a447-30d4ecf262c7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
