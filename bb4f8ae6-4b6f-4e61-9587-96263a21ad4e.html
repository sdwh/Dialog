Nice to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Hi John, I'm Tom, one of the software engineers here. So what can I do for you?<p class=message>Well, Tom, I'm here to see how well your team is complying with the ISO 27001 standards. Are you familiar with the requirements?<p class="message sent">Yes, we've been preparing for this audit for a while now. I think we're ready.<p class=message>Great to hear! Can you show me some of the security measures you've put in place?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Here's a list of the access controls we've implemented for our servers.<p class=message>Hmm, looks good so far. And how about your password policies?<p class="message sent">We've required our employees to use complex passwords with a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.<p class=message>Impressive. I'm glad to see you take security seriously. But hey, do you have any fun hobbies outside of work?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yes, I'm a huge fan of board games. I have a collection of over 200 games at home.<p class=message>Wow, that's quite the collection! What's your favorite board game?<p class="message sent">I love playing Settlers of Catan. It's a classic.<p class=message>I've played that before too. It's always a good time. (pauses) Okay, let's get back to business. How about your disaster recovery plan?<p class="message sent">We have a comprehensive plan in place that includes regular backups, testing, and offsite storage.<p class=message>Excellent. And I see you've network segmentation as well. That's an important safeguard against potential data breaches.<p class="message sent">Yes, we've tried our best to make sure our system is secure.<p class=message>It definitely looks like it. Alright, Tom, I think I have enough information for now. Thanks for your time.<p class="message sent">No problem, John. Feel free to come back anytime. Oh, and let me know if you want to play board games sometime!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bb4e2342-6912-43c1-a798-2abe8d973bfc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
