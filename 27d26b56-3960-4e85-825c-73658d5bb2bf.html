Sometimes it helps to have a fresh set of eyes on the problem.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I just don't want to waste anyone's time by asking for help with something I should be able to fix myself.<p class=message>Don't worry about that. We all need help sometimes, and it's better to ask for it than to struggle alone.<p class="message sent">You're right. I'll shoot our supervisor an email and see if they have any suggestions.<p class=message>Great. And in the meantime, have you tried searching online for similar errors or finding resources on the topic?<p class="message sent">Actually, I hadn't thought of that. That's a good suggestion.<p class=message>Yeah, it can be really helpful to see how other people have tackled similar issues.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice. I'll get on that right away.<p class=message>No problem. And if you need any more help, don't hesitate to ask!<p class="message sent">Will do.
