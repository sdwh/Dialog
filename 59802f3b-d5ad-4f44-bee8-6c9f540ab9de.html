How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How are you?<p class=message>I'm doing great. So, let's get down to business. I've looked over your financial statement and everything seems to be in order.<p class="message sent">That's great news. I was a bit worried that we might have missed something.<p class=message>No worries, it all looks good. Just a few minor adjustments here and there, but nothing major.<p class="message sent">That's a relief. I'm glad we hired you.<p class=message>(chuckles) Well, I'm glad I was able to help. So, what are your plans for the rest of the day?<p class="message sent">Oh, not much. Just meetings and paperwork. What about you?<p class=message>Same here. Just some more meetings and then I'll probably go for a run later.<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. The dreaded run. I should start doing that too.<p class=message>(laughs) It's not that bad once you get used to it. Plus, it's a great way to clear your head.<p class="message sent">That's true. I might have to try it sometime.<p class=message>Absolutely. Anyway, let me finish up some paperwork and then I'll get back to you with the final report.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Thanks again for all your help. Have a great day!<p class=message>You too, B.
