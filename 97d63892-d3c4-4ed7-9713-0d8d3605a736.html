Are you looking for a specific type?<p class="message sent">Not really, I just want something colorful and cheerful.<p class=message>Well, you can't go wrong with a bouquet of mixed daisies. They're always a favorite.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect, but I also want to surprise my girlfriend with a single red rose. Do you have those?<p class=message>Of course we do. Roses are a classic choice.<p class="message sent">Do you have any tips on how to keep them fresh for as long as possible?<p class=message>Sure, just make sure to cut the stems diagonally, change the water every few days, and keep them in a cool place out of direct sunlight.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice. Do you have any other recommendations?<p class=message>How about a potted plant? They're great for adding some greenery to your home, and they last longer than cut flowers.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. What do you suggest?<p class=message>Our succulents are really popular right now. They're easy to take care of and come in a variety of shapes and sizes.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll take one of those as well. Thanks for all your help!<p class=message>No problem, it's my pleasure to help. That will be $25 in total.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Here you go. Keep the change.<p class=message>Wow, you're too kind. Thank you so much! Have a great day.<p class="message sent">You too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=97d2604a-958a-40af-93d9-9846e73cdb1d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
