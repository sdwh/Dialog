Welcome to the Statue of Liberty! Would you like me to take a picture of you in front of the statue?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! That would be great. This is my first time in New York and I'm so excited to see the Statue of Liberty in person.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's get the perfect shot for you. Would you like to stand closer or farther away from the statue?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think closer would be better. I want to show my friends back home how big it really is!<p class=message>Good idea! Ok, let me snap a few pictures of you. Say cheese!<p class="message sent">Cheese!<p class=message>Great! Let me show you how they turned out. Wow, you look amazing! These pictures will definitely make your friends jealous.<p class="message sent">Haha, I hope so! Thank you so much for your help.<p class=message>You're welcome. Did you know that the statue was a gift from the French to the American people?<p class="message sent">Really? I had no idea.<p class=message>Yes, it symbolizes freedom and democracy for all. It's a representation of the strong bond between our two countries.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. I'm going to look up more information about it later.<p class=message>I'm glad I could teach you something new. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class="message sent">No, thank you. This was perfect. I'll definitely recommend you to anyone I know coming to New York.<p class=message>That's very kind of you, thank you.
