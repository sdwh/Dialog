I see you've come for some fruit picking. Welcome to my farm!<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, I've always wanted to try fruit picking, and I heard South Australia is the perfect place for it.<p class=message>Well, you're in luck! We're currently picking apples, peaches, and pears. Which one would you like to try?<p class="message sent">Hmm... I think I'll go for the apples.<p class=message>Excellent choice. Let me show you how to pick them. You need to gently twist and pull the apple upwards, making sure not to damage the stem. Here, you try.<p class="message sent">(picking an apple) Wow, that was easy!<p class=message>That's great to hear. Now, do you want to know a fun fact about apples?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'd love to hear it.<p class=message>Did you know that apples are one of the few fruits that float in water? In fact, they're made up of 25% air!<p class="message sent">That's pretty amazing. Speaking of amazing, this farm is beautiful. How long have you been working here?<p class=message>Thank you. I've been working here for over 20 years. It's hard work, but I love being close to nature and seeing the fruits of my labor.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. And what do you do with all the fruit you pick?<p class=message>Most of it we sell at the markets, but we also make jams and pies with the leftover fruit that doesn't sell.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds delicious! Do you have a favorite fruit?<p class=message>I have to say I'm partial to peaches. They're sweet, juicy, and perfect for a summer day.<p class="message sent">I'll have to try those next time. Thanks for showing me around and teaching me how to pick apples.<p class=message>You're welcome, anytime. Just remember, when life gives you apples, make apple pie!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=34c11748-229d-4c46-af4a-518f10fce85e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
