Did you need any help with it?<p class="message sent">No, I was able to do it on my own.<p class=message>Oh really? You're becoming quite the smart kid.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I have a good example to follow.<p class=message>What do you mean?<p class="message sent">I mean you, of course!<p class=message>Haha, well thank you. So, what homework did you have today?<p class="message sent">We had a lot of math problems to solve.<p class=message>Ah, math. Do you find it challenging?<p class="message sent">Not really, I think it's fun!<p class=message>That's amazing, I was terrible at math when I was your age.<p class="message sent">Really? Maybe you should try it again now.<p class=message>Ha, I think I'll leave that to you. But speaking of homework, have you seen your dad doing his work at home?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, he's always on his computer typing away.<p class=message>That's right, he's a hardworking guy.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I think I'll be just like him when I grow up.<p class=message>I'm sure you will be!
