How was your class today?<p class="message sent">It was great! We learned how to make traditional Okinawan food and drinks.<p class=message>That's fantastic! What did you learn specifically?<p class="message sent">Well, we made some tasty pork belly and also learned how to make an Okinawan classic, Orion beer.<p class=message>Wow, I love pork belly! And beer too, of course. How was the Orion beer?<p class="message sent">It was amazing. We learned about the brewing process and got to taste some fresh beer straight from the tap.<p class=message>That sounds like a dream come true. Did you bring back any recipes or new ideas for our restaurant?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I think we could add some Okinawan-inspired dishes to our menu, like the pork belly or Okinawan-style soba noodles.<p class=message>Yes, that's a great idea. What about drinks?<p class="message sent">Well, we also learned how to make shikuwasa juice, which is a citrusy drink from Okinawa. I think it would be a good addition to our cocktail menu.<p class=message>Absolutely. Our customers would love to try something new and unique. Thanks for bringing back these ideas and recipes, B.<p class="message sent">Of course, A. I can't wait to start experimenting in the kitchen and behind the bar. Okinawan cuisine and drinks are really amazing.<p class=message>I'm excited too. Let's get to work and bring a taste of Okinawa to our customers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ce475ff5-31c6-450b-ae02-815171655388.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
