How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi A, it's going pretty well. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing alright, thanks. So, we're tasked with designing a fitness app. Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Well, the first thing we should consider is how to track progress accurately. Maybe we could incorporate GPS or a pedometer?<p class=message>That sounds good. And we could also include a feature that recommends workouts based on the user's fitness level and goals.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We could have a quiz at the beginning to determine their fitness level and then suggest workouts accordingly.<p class=message>Great idea. How about including a nutrition guide as well? That way users can have a well-rounded approach to their fitness journey.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And we could also include healthy recipes that align with their fitness goals.<p class=message>Yes! And maybe we could include badges or rewards that users can earn for reaching milestones in their fitness journey.<p class="message sent">Ooh, I like that. It would give users an extra incentive to stay motivated.<p class=message>Exactly. And we could also incorporate social media sharing so users can share their progress with friends and family.<p class="message sent">That's a great way to keep them engaged and accountable. I think we're onto something good here!<p class=message>Me too. Let's get started on the design process and make this app the best it can be!<p class="message sent">Alright, let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4d2c5713-f263-4433-8792-5425c4a2d69d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
