Are you ready for today's shoot?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Yes, I'm excited to shoot this scene.<p class=message>Great! Let's get started. Can you give me your best surprised expression for the first shot?<p class="message sent">(makes a surprised face) How was that?<p class=message>Perfect! Now, let's move to the next angle. Can you stand a little to the left?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. (moves to the left)<p class=message>You know, I heard a funny story on set yesterday.<p class="message sent">Oh really? Do tell.<p class=message>Apparently, one of the crew members mistook a prop for a real gun and almost called the police!<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's hilarious. I can't imagine what would have happened.<p class=message>(laughs) Yeah, it could have been a disaster. Okay, let's get back to work. Can you give me a worried expression for this shot?<p class="message sent">(looks worried) Like this?<p class=message>Perfect! You're a natural, B. Just a few more shots and we'll be done for the day.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. I could use a break anyway.<p class=message>(chuckles) You actors and your pampering. The crew works twice as hard.<p class="message sent">(grinning) Hey, we're the ones who have to look good on camera. It's a tough job.<p class=message>(smiling) I guess you have a point there. Alright, let's finish strong. Can you do a happy expression for the last shot?<p class="message sent">(beaming) How's this?<p class=message>(impressed) Fantastic! That's a wrap for today. Thanks, B. You did great.<p class="message sent">(grinning widely) Thanks, A.
