How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It was great, thanks for asking. I went to the beach and got some sun. How about you?<p class=message>Same here! I went to a barbecue with friends and family. It was fantastic. Anyway, we have a new project to work on. Have you checked your email?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's about designing a new logo for a company, right?<p class=message>That's correct. We need to come up with a creative and innovative design that will make the company stand out. What do you think we should do?<p class="message sent">Well, I suggest we research the company's history, values and mission statement first. This way, we can have a good grasp of what they're all about and incorporate it in our design.<p class=message>Great idea! And I'll assign you to create the first draft. Be creative and have fun with it. I'll review it and give feedback afterwards.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. I'll do my best. By the way, have you tried the new café down the street?<p class=message>Not yet. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">I've heard great things about it. Do you want to grab coffee there later?<p class=message>Sure thing! It's always good to take a break and refresh our minds.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'll finish my research and start on the logo draft. See you at the café later!<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Keep up the good work, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=77165250-96dc-4968-b786-984c9c13b563.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
