Thanks for setting up this meeting with me. I'm really excited about my new book!<p class="message sent">Of course! We're always excited to work with talented writers like you. So, tell me about your book.<p class=message>Well, it's called "The Sassy Squirrel and the Mysterious Marshmallow." It's a children's book about a squirrel detective who solves a mystery with the help of a marshmallow.<p class="message sent">That sounds adorable! I love a good animal detective story. What age group is it aimed at?<p class=message>It's for kids ages 6-9. I think they'll really enjoy the whimsical characters and the silly mystery.<p class="message sent">Excellent. And have you thought about the illustrations?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I've been working with an amazing illustrator who really captures the spirit of the story. I think the two of you will work really well together.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. And what's your timeline for completion?<p class=message>I'm hoping to have everything finished in about six months. The manuscript is essentially finished, and the illustrator is already underway with the sketches.<p class="message sent">Perfect. We can definitely work with that timeline. Is there anything else you need from us?<p class=message>Not at the moment, but thank you for asking. I know this will be a fun project to work on together.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We can't wait to see the finished product. Thanks for coming in today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3cce0c9d-f554-410e-869f-4c3f3da2e4e8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
