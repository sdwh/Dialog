Let's hear your case.<p class="message sent">My neighbor built a fence that crosses the boundary of my property. I need to take action but I'm not sure what to do.<p class=message>That's a common issue. Have you spoken with your neighbor about it?<p class="message sent">I have but they are not willing to move the fence.<p class=message>Alright then, let's look at your options. We can either try to negotiate with your neighbor, or file a lawsuit to compel them to remove the fence.<p class="message sent">I don't want things to get too ugly, so maybe we should try negotiation first.<p class=message>I agree. It's always best to try to resolve things amicably before taking legal action.<p class="message sent">Speaking of legal action, have you heard about the lawyer who sued a bakery because they didn't put enough frosting on his cake?<p class=message>(laughs) I have, and that's a perfect example of frivolous lawsuits.<p class="message sent">It's hard to believe some of the cases that come up in court.<p class=message>It is, but that's part of my job - to help my clients navigate through the legal system.<p class="message sent">Well, I'm certainly glad I came to you. You've been very helpful.<p class=message>Thank you, it's my pleasure to assist. Let's get started on that negotiation with your neighbor.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8adc00e2-492a-45de-a867-76fc89805a62.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
