How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thank you. So, what's the plan for the next few months?<p class="message sent">Well, we have a few offers for live performances, and I think we should consider them carefully.<p class=message>I agree. Do we have any interesting venues on the list?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do! There's a festival in the countryside that's looking for performers, and I think it could be a great opportunity for us.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds fun! I love playing in outdoor festivals.<p class="message sent">Me too! And we also have an offer from a club in the city that's asking us to perform on their opening night.<p class=message>That sounds exciting as well. How about the dates? Do they fit our schedule?<p class="message sent">I've checked, and I think we can make it work. We just need to decide which one suits our style the best.<p class=message>Right. Do we have any other offers that we need to consider?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a corporate event that's looking for a performer, but I don't think it's the right fit for us.<p class=message>Okay, let's skip that one then. So, which one do you think we should go for?<p class="message sent">Personally, I think the festival in the countryside would be a great fit for us. But I want to hear your opinion as well.<p class=message>I agree with you. Let's go for the festival then. It's going to be a blast!<p class="message sent">Great! I'll start negotiating the details with them and get back to you.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Thanks for your hard work, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. We're a team, remember?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e795c189-7ca6-43d3-b159-4839216621f6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
