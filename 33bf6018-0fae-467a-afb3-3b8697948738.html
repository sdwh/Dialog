Can you please state your name and reason for being here at the station?<p class="message sent">Hello. My name is Bob and I’m here because someone stole my bike last night.<p class=message>I see. Could you please describe the bike to me? We’ll start looking for it right away.<p class="message sent">It’s a red and black bike with a yellow seat. It’s quite new actually, only a few months old.<p class=message>Thank you for the description. We’ll do our best to find it. By the way, have you ever been to the station before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven’t. Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, you seemed pretty calm and collected for someone who just lost their bike.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I guess. It’s just a bike. I’m more upset that it was a gift from my girlfriend.<p class=message>Ah, I understand. Women can be quite particular about their gifts.<p class="message sent">Tell me about it. I remember one time I got her a subscription to a gym and she was mad at me for months.<p class=message>Gym membership? That’s risky territory. You’re better off with flowers or chocolates.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I learned that the hard way. Thanks for the advice.<p class=message>No problem. Hopefully we’ll find your bike soon and you can surprise your girlfriend with it.<p class="message sent">That would be great. I don’t know how much longer I can keep borrowing her bike.<p class=message>Borrowing her bike, huh? Well, it looks like you might be in the doghouse for a while. Good luck, Bob.<p class="message sent">Ha! Thanks, officer. I appreciate it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=33ba3975-88aa-48c7-8b86-b6d62f528ddd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
