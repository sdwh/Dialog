It's absolutely stunning. I can't wait to share it with my followers on my blog.<p class="message sent">Yes, the view from the top of the temple is breathtaking. And there's so much history here too.<p class=message>Definitely, I'm going to make sure I include some interesting facts about the temple in my blog post.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. The temple was actually originally built in 778, and has been rebuilt over the years due to fires and other natural disasters.<p class=message>Really? It's amazing how it's stood the test of time. Hey, do you think we can go down to the waterfall and take some more shots?<p class="message sent">Of course, the Otowa Waterfall is a major attraction here. It's said that by drinking from one of the streams, you'll be granted a wish.<p class=message>Oh, I have to do that. Maybe my wish will come true and I'll hit one million followers soon!<p class="message sent">Haha, you never know. Speaking of wishes, have you heard about the love stones?<p class=message>No, what are those?<p class="message sent">There are two stones at the bottom of the waterfall that are placed just far enough apart for people to try and walk between them with their eyes closed. If you succeed, it's said that your wish for love will come true.<p class=message>Wow, that's quite a challenge. Will you try it with me?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'll give it a go. But I can't promise anything about the outcome of the wish!<p class=message>Alright, let's head down and give it a shot. This is going to make for some great content on my blog!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f16039e5-56ae-43ef-8f6c-e2009536db08.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
