It's made with authentic Swiss cheese and served with an assortment of bread and vegetables.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. How do you recommend we start?<p class="message sent">You can dip the bread or veggies into the hot cheese using the long-stemmed fondue forks.<p class=message>Wow, this is tasty. I love how the cheese is creamy and flavorful.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's the result of the perfect blend of cheese, white wine, and spices. It's important to keep stirring the cheese to avoid clumping.<p class=message>That makes sense. What type of cheese do you use for this fondue?<p class="message sent">We use a blend of Gruyere and Emmental cheese, which are both famous Swiss cheeses.<p class=message>I can definitely taste the Gruyere. It has a nutty flavor, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, and the Emmental gives it a mild and slightly sweet flavor.<p class=message>I also noticed that the cheese keeps a consistent temperature throughout the meal.<p class="message sent">That's because the fondue pot is heated by a small flame underneath it.<p class=message>This fondue is fantastic. I'd give it a 9 out of 10. What's your rating?<p class="message sent">Thank you. As a chef, I give it a solid 8.5. The dipping options are great, but I always think there's room for improvement.<p class=message>That's a fair assessment. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this fondue to anyone visiting Lucerne.<p class="message sent">Thank you for trying our fondue. It's always great to have food bloggers like yourself write about our restaurant.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c6becb46-0517-47fe-adb1-7c6db1b2dfc1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
