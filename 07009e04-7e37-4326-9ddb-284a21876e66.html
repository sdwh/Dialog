Can I get you started with some breakfast?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. I'll have the spaghetti with meatballs and a strong espresso, please.<p class=message>Excellent choice, sir. Though I must tell you, we're a fully-fledged Italian joint, and we call it breakfast spaghetti.<p class="message sent">(chuckles) Alright, so breakfast spaghetti it is.<p class=message>Would you like some parmesan cheese on top?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! You can never go wrong with more cheese.<p class=message>I agree! And for your coffee, we serve it as an espresso shot or an Americano. Which would you prefer?<p class="message sent">Just a shot of espresso for me, thanks.<p class=message>One espresso shot, and breakfast spaghetti coming right up!<p class="message sent">(curiously) By the way, how did you become a bakery chef?<p class=message>It was a childhood dream of mine, really. I used to love baking when I was a kid, and it just stuck with me. How about yourself? How did you get into coffee-making?<p class="message sent">It was sort of a happy accident, really. I always loved the coffee smell, and one day I just started working in a caf√©. I never looked back.<p class=message>(smiling) That's fantastic. It's great when you find a career that you truly enjoy.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of enjoyment, this breakfast spaghetti is delicious!<p class=message>I'm so glad to hear that! Would you like to take any pastries to go?<p class="message sent">(glancing at the counter) Yes, please. I'll have a croissant, a danish, and one of those cinnamon rolls.<p class=message>(laughing) That's a breakfast of champions. I'll wrap them up for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you! And let me know if you ever need a taste-tester for any new bakery items.<p class=message>I definitely will! It was nice chatting with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=06ffebf7-1800-429d-b4c6-c00551367c78.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
