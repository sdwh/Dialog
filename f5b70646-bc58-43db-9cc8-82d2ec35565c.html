I'm so glad we booked this food tour with you, B.<p class="message sent">Yes, this is definitely the place to come for fresh seafood in Tokyo. Have you tried uni (sea urchin) before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it good?<p class="message sent">It's a Japanese delicacy, and it's definitely an acquired taste. But let's try it together and see what you think!<p class=message>Mmm, it's so creamy and fresh! I can taste the ocean straight away.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's exactly how you should taste it. Now, let's move on to the tuna sashimi. See how it's so bright red? That means it's really fresh.<p class=message>This is so delicious! I never knew tuna could taste this amazing.<p class="message sent">The secret is in the preparation, and using only the highest quality ingredients. That's why sushi in Japan is famous all over the world.<p class=message>I can definitely see why now. Speaking of sushi, I see they have some exotic options like fugu (pufferfish) and raw squid. Do you think we should try them?<p class="message sent">Of course! As a local guide, my job is to help you experience the authentic Tokyo food culture. Let's go for it.<p class=message>This market is a food lover's paradise. Thank you for guiding us through it, B.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. I'm always happy to share my love of Japanese cuisine with visitors. And now, let's head over to the sake bar and end our food tour with a drink. Cheers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f5b27c8f-83d8-4cd1-915b-39e8ae61b85a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
