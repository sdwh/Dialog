It's quite challenging.<p class=message>Don't worry, I can help you with that. Can you show me the problem you're stuck on?<p class="message sent">Sure, it's about fractions. Do you remember how to add and subtract fractions with different denominators?<p class=message>Of course, I remember it like the back of my hand. Let me show you an example.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's so easy when you explain it to me. Thank you, Mom!<p class=message>No problem, it's good to refresh our memory sometimes. By the way, how was your day at school?<p class="message sent">It was great! We played a game in PE and I scored a goal in soccer.<p class=message>That's amazing! You're getting better and better at sports.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Mom. What about you? How was your day at work?<p class=message>It was busy, but I managed to complete all my tasks for today. Now, I can relax and spend time with you.<p class="message sent">Yay! Let's watch a movie together after we finish homework.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. But first, let's finish the rest of your math homework.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's get to work.<p class=message>Great attitude, B. You'll do well in life with that kind of persistence.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Mom! You always believe in me.<p class=message>Of course I do. You are my little star!<p class="message sent">Awww, you're the best mom ever!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=417a2b45-9b89-4f3e-a87c-6eda238fb73e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
