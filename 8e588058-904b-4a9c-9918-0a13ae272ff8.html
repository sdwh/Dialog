How's your day been so far?<p class="message sent">It's been good, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>It's been busy as always, but I can't complain. I'm just happy to be here baking and making delicious treats.<p class="message sent">Speaking of delicious treats, I see you've got some new pastries in the display case. Can you tell me more about them?<p class=message>Sure! Those are our new spring macarons. We've got lavender, lemon, and raspberry flavors. They're all gluten-free and made with organic ingredients.<p class="message sent">They look amazing! I'm definitely going to have to try one. Do you have any personal favorites?<p class=message>Honestly, they're all so good. But if I had to pick one, I'd say the raspberry. It's got the perfect balance of sweet and tart.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious. And what other desserts do you recommend?<p class=message>Our chocolate croissants are always popular, as well as our cinnamon rolls. And if you're feeling really indulgent, we have a decadent chocolate fudge cake that is to die for.<p class="message sent">Wow, so many great options! Okay, I'll have a raspberry macaron and a cinnamon roll, please.<p class=message>Great choices! And I'll also give you a coupon for 10% off your next purchase as a little thank you for supporting our bakery.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! I can't wait to enjoy these treats.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. I love sharing my passion for baking with others. Let me know how you like everything!<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Thanks again and have a great day.<p class=message>You too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8e553e1b-7943-484d-83c5-c0722b61f81b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
