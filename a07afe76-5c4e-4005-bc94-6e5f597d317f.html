Can you help me?<p class=message>Sure thing. What's the problem?<p class="message sent">It's about apples and oranges. I have to figure out how many of each I can buy with $10.<p class=message>Hmm, let's see. If an apple costs 50 cents and an orange costs 75 cents, you can buy 20 apples or 13 oranges.<p class="message sent">That's so many fruits!<p class=message>Yup, you could even have a fruit party with all of that.<p class="message sent">Haha, that sounds like fun.<p class=message>So, how about your English homework?<p class="message sent">It's not too bad. I have to write a story using ten new vocab words.<p class=message>That sounds like a good challenge. What are the words?<p class="message sent">Let me see... um, mischievous, elusive, blunder, flustered, translucent, glisten, ornament, diligent, delectable, and reprimand.<p class=message>Those are some good words. How about this for a story: Once upon a time, a mischievous fairy wandered into a forest. She was known for her elusive nature, always flitting about from one place to another. One day, as she was playing near a stream, she saw a shiny pebble and decided to take it with her. But as she flew away, she accidentally dropped the pebble and it caused a blunder in the river flow. The fairy became flustered and didn't know what to do. She looked at the translucent water and saw that the pebble was glistening at the bottom. Suddenly, an idea came to her. She flew back to her fairy friend's house and together, they used an ornament to attract a school of fish to the pebble. The fairies were so diligent in their efforts that they eventually retrieved the pebble and enjoyed a delectable feast with the fish. But their boss, the queen of the fairies, wasn't very happy with their mischievous behavior and gave them a strong reprimand.<p class="message sent">Wow, mom, that was amazing! You're so good at this.<p class=message>Thanks, kiddo. I used to write a lot of stories when I was your age too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a0796340-2555-4e17-9c8c-0561fde969d3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
