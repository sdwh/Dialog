And you?<p class=message>I'm great, thanks for asking. Ready to get started with the meeting?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, let's do this!<p class=message>So first thing on the agenda, how's the progress on the new project?<p class="message sent">We're making steady progress, but we could use some extra help with the design aspect. Do you have anyone in mind?<p class=message>Actually, I have a friend who's a freelance designer. Let me put you in touch with her.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect, thanks A. On another note, has anyone seen the office dog lately?<p class=message>Oh yes, I gave him the day off. He worked really hard this week and deserves a break.<p class="message sent">That's so thoughtful of you. Speaking of breaks, have we decided where to go for our next team-building activity?<p class=message>Not yet, any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking we could try that new escape room place that just opened up. I heard it's really fun.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea, let's do it. And for lunch today, how about we order some pizza?<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing, let's go for it.<p class=message>Alright, that concludes our meeting for today. Thank you, B, for your input.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, A. Have a great day!<p class=message>You too, B. And don't forget to pet the office dog when he comes back.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=86901f3a-3189-4a5a-a3dc-85fa6c4714aa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
