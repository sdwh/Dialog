Are you our taxi driver for today's ride to Hiroshima?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. Good afternoon! Ready to go?<p class=message>Yes! By the way, do you have any favorite music to listen to while on the road?<p class="message sent">Oh, I like all kinds of music. But I'm a big fan of classic rock. How about you?<p class=message>Same here! But I also like pop music. Can we play some Beatles songs?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! The Beatles are classic. It's always great to listen to their music on long rides.<p class=message>Speaking of long rides, do you have any tips for avoiding motion sickness?<p class="message sent">Sure, try to avoid reading or using your phone on the road. I always keep a pack of peppermint gum with me too, it helps settle the stomach.<p class=message>Great tip! Do you have any interesting stories from driving for so long?<p class="message sent">One time, I picked up a group of musicians who were touring around Japan. They taught me how to play the guitar and sang some songs with me. It was a blast!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like an amazing experience! What else do you like to do in your free time?<p class="message sent">I like to go on hikes and explore different parts of Japan. It's such a beautiful country, there's always something new to discover.<p class=message>That's cool, I should do that too. How much longer until we reach Hiroshima?<p class="message sent">It should take us about two hours. But don't worry, we'll arrive before you know it.<p class=message>I'm looking forward to visiting the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a very moving place. I'm glad you get to experience it for yourself.<p class=message>Thank you, and thanks for the enjoyable ride! You're a great taxi driver.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, it was my pleasure.
