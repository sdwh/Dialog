How's it going today?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, thanks. What can I do for you today?<p class=message>I've been having a bit of trouble with my cows lately. They seem to be getting sick a lot more often than usual.<p class="message sent">Well, there are a number of different things that could be causing that. Have you been keeping up with their vaccinations?<p class=message>I think so, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to check my records.<p class="message sent">That's a good place to start. It's also important to make sure they're getting enough food and water, and that their living conditions are as clean and comfortable as possible.<p class=message>Yeah, I've been trying to keep up with all of that too, but it can be a lot of work sometimes.<p class="message sent">I hear you. It's definitely not easy raising livestock â€“ but it's also very rewarding.<p class=message>Absolutely! I love my cows, and I want to make sure they're healthy and happy.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. If you need any help or advice, don't hesitate to give me a call.<p class=message>Will do! Thanks, Doc.<p class="message sent">No problem. Take care, and good luck with your cows!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=74ebc4ae-f723-45f3-9d33-d9f95693ff9a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
