But have you heard of meat pies or sausage rolls?<p class="message sent">Meat pies? Are you kidding me? That sounds more like a British thing, doesn't it?<p class=message>True, but adopted as a staple food by Aussies. They even have a national competition for the best pie!<p class="message sent">Wow, I would love to try one of those. What about something sweet? Any famous desserts?<p class=message>Yes, Pavlova is a must-try. A meringue cake with whipped cream and fruit toppings.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! How about drinks? What do Aussies drink?<p class=message>Beer, mate. Lots of different types of beer.<p class="message sent">I've heard of Fosters. Is that popular there?<p class=message>Honestly, not really. It's more like an international beer brand. Australians usually go for something local like XXXX or VB.<p class="message sent">VB? What does that stand for?<p class=message>Victoria Bitter. It's brewed in Victoria and pretty popular in the country.<p class="message sent">Interesting, I'll keep that in mind. So, what else is there to know about traditional Australian cuisine?<p class=message>Well, they also have vegemite. It's a brown paste made from yeast extract and often spread on toast.<p class="message sent">Ah yes, I've heard it's an acquired taste. Have you tried it before?<p class=message>Yeah, I did. Let's just say...not my cup of tea. But Australians love it.<p class="message sent">I see. Well, it seems like we have a lot to explore next time we visit Australia!<p class=message>Definitely! And we can't forget about the seafood â€“ prawns, oysters, and fish are all amazing there.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a feast. I can't wait to try all of it.
