Welcome to our cafe. What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'd like a cup of hand-brewed coffee, please.<p class=message>Great choice! Which blend do you prefer? We have a medium roast from Guatemala and a dark roast from Ethiopia.<p class="message sent">I'll go with the medium roast from Guatemala. And I'm also curious about your specialty desserts.<p class=message>Well, we have our popular matcha mille crepe cake which is made with fresh matcha powder.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! How long does it take to make?<p class=message>It takes about 2 hours to make the crepes and another hour to assemble the cake.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's quite a process. I'll definitely have to try it.<p class=message>Great! I'll have that prepared for you while your coffee is brewing.<p class="message sent">Thank you. So, how did you become interested in baking?<p class=message>I've always had a sweet tooth and a passion for creating new desserts. I attended culinary school and specialized in pastry making.<p class="message sent">That's impressive. What's your favorite dessert to make?<p class=message>I would have to say anything with chocolate. I love experimenting with different types of chocolate and creating unique flavor combinations.<p class="message sent">I'll keep that in mind for next time. Here's my coffee, smells heavenly. How do you suggest I pair it with the cake?<p class=message>The light, fruity notes of the Guatemalan coffee blend well with the rich, earthy flavor of the matcha crepe cake. It's a combination that complements each other's flavors.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a perfect match. I can't wait to try it. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class=message>No problem, enjoy your treat! Let me know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5082e65b-35a3-4bdc-967e-90d4ed08637c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
