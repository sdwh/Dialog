How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Professor A. I'm doing well. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks. So, I wanted to discuss the course schedule for next semester with you.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm happy to discuss it. What are your thoughts?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking we could add a new elective course on "Famous Cats in History."<p class="message sent">(laughing) That's certainly an interesting topic. Do you think it would be popular among students?<p class=message>Yes, I think so. It's a fun and unique topic that I think many students would enjoy.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'm willing to give it a try. What other courses do you suggest we include?<p class=message>How about a course on creative writing? I think it would be great to encourage students to express themselves through writing.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good addition. We should also consider offering more language courses for international students.<p class=message>Agreed. I'll make sure to add some language courses to the schedule. What about scheduling for exams? Shall we stick to the usual schedule?<p class="message sent">Yes, I think the current schedule works well. We should also make sure that there are no clashes between exams.<p class=message>Absolutely. I'll double-check the schedule and make sure there are no conflicts. Any other suggestions?<p class="message sent">Maybe we could also consider having more guest speakers or hosting workshops to provide students with practical skills.<p class=message>Great idea, Professor B. I'll see what we can arrange in that regard. Thank you for your input.<p class="message sent">Of course, happy to help. Let's make sure to keep the courses exciting and engaging for our students.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b4a9d9d1-6827-48bd-9e28-9d825889073d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
