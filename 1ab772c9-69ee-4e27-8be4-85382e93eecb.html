We have a good crowd tonight.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Have you tried any of our new cocktails yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>You should definitely try the Texas Mule. It's made with Tito's vodka and our homemade ginger beer.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious, I'll have to give it a try.<p class=message>And for food, have you had our queso dip? It's a customer favorite.<p class="message sent">Yes, I love it! It always pairs well with a good beer.<p class=message>Speaking of beers, have you ever tried the local brew "Shiner Bock"?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class=message>It's really popular here in Texas, you should definitely give it a try.<p class="message sent">I think I will. So A, have you ever made any crazy cocktails?<p class=message>Oh yeah, I once made a cocktail with bacon-infused bourbon, maple syrup, and a strip of bacon as a garnish. It was surprisingly good.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's definitely a unique one. Speaking of unique, did you hear about that guy who tried to rob a bank with a water gun?<p class=message>Really? Did he actually get away with it?<p class="message sent">No, he got caught pretty quickly. But it does make for a good story.<p class=message>That's hilarious. Well, let's make sure to keep the good drinks and conversations flowing for our customers tonight.<p class="message sent">Agreed, cheers to that!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1ab1ea73-bfe5-4277-b407-a5dabe7d9400.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
