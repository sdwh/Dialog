It looks like we're going to be using Bootstrap and ASP.NET MVC 5 for development.<p class=message>Those are some solid choices. Bootstrap makes it really easy to implement a responsive design, and ASP.NET MVC is great for structuring the back-end.<p class="message sent">Right, I've actually used ASP.NET MVC before in another project, so I'm pretty comfortable with it. What about you? Have you had much experience with Bootstrap?<p class=message>Yeah, I've used it a few times. It's really convenient for creating a consistent look across different pages.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And it's nice that it comes with some built-in components that we can use, like modals and date pickers.<p class=message>Yeah, those are definitely handy. I'm also excited to use the grid system to help with layout.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Speaking of layout, do you think we should do a fixed or fluid layout for this project?<p class=message>Hmm, that's a good question. I think it depends on whether we want to prioritize consistency or flexibility.<p class="message sent">I'm leaning towards a fixed layout, just because it ensures that everything is always in the same place.<p class=message>That's fair. And we can always add some breakpoints if we want to optimize for different screen sizes.<p class="message sent">Exactly. Plus, we can always make tweaks as we go along. That's the beauty of development.<p class=message>Couldn't agree more. I'm excited to get started on this project with you, B.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. Let's make it awesome!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b88039b9-28fe-46da-bd01-3edc4b41eaf3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
