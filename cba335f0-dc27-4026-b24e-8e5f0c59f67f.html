Where are you headed to today?<p class=message>I'm heading to Adelaide, do you know the best way to get there?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. I have been driving around this area for over 10 years now. How was your day yesterday?<p class=message>It was good. I went to a friend’s party and had a great time.<p class="message sent">Sounds like fun. Did you meet anyone interesting?<p class=message>Yes, I met a guy who is a professional photographer. I was amazed by his work.<p class="message sent">That's great. I love photography too, especially landscape photography.<p class=message>Really? That's awesome. Do you have any interesting stories to share about your job?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I’ve had interesting passengers before. Once, I picked up a famous singer and I had to pretend not to know who she was.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds exciting. Is it common for you to drive famous people around?<p class="message sent">Not really, but I do get to meet a variety of people from all walks of life.<p class=message>Oh, I just remembered that I left my wallet at home. Do you accept credit cards?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. I also have a contactless payment option if that is more convenient.<p class=message>That's perfect. I'm glad I won't have to make a detour back home.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. I'm happy to help. So, do you have any plans for your trip to Adelaide?<p class=message>Yes, I plan to visit some wineries and enjoy the beautiful scenery in the area.<p class="message sent">That sounds lovely. Have you been to Adelaide before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time. I heard that the city has a great food and wine culture.<p class="message sent">Yes, it definitely does. If you need any recommendations, feel free to ask me. I know all the hidden gems.<p class=message>I appreciate it. Thank you very much!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cba14d36-7f90-4666-b098-ca435f8af683.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
