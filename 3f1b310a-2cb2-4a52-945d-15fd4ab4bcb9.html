What sort of breach are we talking about?<p class="message sent">They've failed to deliver the goods we agreed upon for the past two shipments.<p class=message>That does sound like a serious issue. Have you tried contacting them about it?<p class="message sent">Yes, multiple times. But they keep giving us excuses and it's really affecting our business.<p class=message>Alright, well we can definitely assist you with drafting a legal letter outlining your concerns and potential legal action. But in the meantime, let's lighten the mood a bit. Have you tried any new restaurants in town lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I just tried this new sushi place down the street and it was amazing.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard good things about that place. I'll have to check it out sometime.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, I highly recommend it. But back to the legal issue at hand, do you think we have a strong case?<p class=message>Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you do have grounds to take legal action. But we will need to further investigate the situation before making any concrete decisions.<p class="message sent">That makes sense, thank you for your help. And thanks for the restaurant recommendation too, haha.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help in any way I can. Just let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3f145483-21a3-4b2b-bd45-c4ac0a5c0589.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
