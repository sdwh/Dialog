I've been working on implementing the database schema and designing the API endpoints.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've been focusing on the frontend development and making it visually appealing with a user-friendly interface.<p class="message sent">Nice work! Have you encountered any bugs or difficulties?<p class=message>Yeah, there was an issue with the responsive design on mobile devices, but I managed to fix it with some media queries.<p class="message sent">Speaking of mobile devices, have you thought about implementing a mobile app version of our website?<p class=message>That's a good idea, but we should probably focus on launching the web version first.<p class="message sent">Sound plan. By the way, have you checked out the latest Javascript framework that was released?<p class=message>I have, but I'm hesitant to use it until it's been proven to be stable and widely adopted.<p class="message sent">That's understandable. It's always best to stick with what we know works for our project.<p class=message>Agreed. How's the server-side authentication coming along?<p class="message sent">I've implemented some basic authentication methods, but I want to make sure it's secure before we launch.<p class=message>That's a priority. We don't want to risk any data breaches and lose the trust of our users.<p class="message sent">Exactly. How about we schedule a meeting with our project manager to discuss the project timeline and milestones?<p class=message>Good idea. It's important that we stay on track and meet our deadlines.<p class="message sent">Definitely. On a lighter note, have you tried any new restaurants lately?<p class=message>Funny you should ask, I just went to this amazing Korean BBQ place and it was delicious!<p class="message sent">Oh man, now I'm craving some Korean BBQ. Let's plan a team lunch there soon.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. We can celebrate the launch of our website while indulging in some tasty food!<p class="message sent">I'm looking forward to it! At least we won't have to worry about any bugs in our food like we do in our code, haha.<p class=message>Haha, let's hope not! But if we do, at least we know how to fix it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5da54937-3422-4b15-bf3a-6aaf0f175254.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
