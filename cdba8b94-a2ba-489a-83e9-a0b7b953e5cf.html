What would you like for lunch today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'll have a chicken teriyaki bento and a hot green tea, please.<p class=message>Great choice! We have just made fresh teriyaki chicken this morning. How spicy would you like it to be?<p class="message sent">Hmm, just a little bit spicy please. I'm not a fan of really spicy food.<p class=message>No problem, we'll make it just right for you. And for your tea, would you like it plain or with a little bit of sweetness?<p class="message sent">Just plain, please. I like to taste the natural flavor of the tea.<p class=message>You got it. That's one chicken teriyaki bento and one hot green tea with no sugar. That'll be 900 yen in total.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. By the way, your shop has such a cozy and cute vibe. Do you make everything here?<p class=message>Thank you! We do make the bentos here every morning, and we also brew our own tea. It's important to us to provide fresh and quality meals for our customers.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. You know, I'm actually visiting from Tokyo and I've been trying different bento shops during my trip. But I have to say, this one is my favorite so far!<p class=message>Wow, thank you! We're so glad you enjoy our food. And if you want to try something new next time, we update our menu every month with seasonal ingredients.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's great to know. I'll definitely come back and try something different next time I'm in town. Thanks for the wonderful lunch and hospitality!<p class=message>Our pleasure! Have a great day, and safe travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cdb6862d-3573-4dde-bc76-080a5d13dcd1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
