It's looking good so far. Are you mostly handling the front-end development with Bootstrap?<p class=message>Yes, that's right. It's been a lot of fun using Bootstrap for this project. It's made designing the interface much easier.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. I'm more on the back-end side, so I haven't had much experience with Bootstrap. But I have been enjoying working with ASP.NET MVC 5.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've heard it's one of the most powerful frameworks for developing web applications.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's got a lot of built-in functionalities that save so much time. And the compatibility with Bootstrap makes it even better.<p class=message>Do you think we should consider using any other frameworks for the project?<p class="message sent">Well, we could, but I think sticking with these two frameworks is the best solution for us since we're already comfortable working with them.<p class=message>Yeah, I agree. As they say, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."<p class="message sent">Haha exactly. Plus, it's important to maintain consistency across different projects for our clients.<p class=message>Absolutely. Well, I'm looking forward to seeing how it all turns out. It's always exciting to see a project come to fruition.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Let's make sure we do our best to deliver a top-notch website.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=22db9e88-66ac-4956-b866-2a0f9101d74b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
