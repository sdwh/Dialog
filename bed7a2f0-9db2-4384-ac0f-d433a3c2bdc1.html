Welcome to our fish market. May I help you with something?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Yes, please. I am a fisherman and I need to buy some fresh fish and prawns for my restaurant.<p class=message>Oh, perfect! We have a great selection of seafood available today. What type of fish are you looking for?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm thinking of preparing some grilled swordfish for my customers. Do you have it?<p class=message>Yes, we have some great swordfish that arrived yesterday. It's fresh and perfect for grilling. Would you like me to wrap some up for you?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And what about prawns? Any recommendations?<p class=message>Our tiger prawns are quite popular among our customers. They are plump and tender, perfect for stir-fry or pasta dishes.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. I'll take a few kilos of those. Do you have any secret tips on how to cook them?<p class=message>Hmm, well personally, I like to marinate them with a little bit of garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice. Then, I saut√© them along with some vegetables and serve them with a side of pasta.<p class="message sent">Yum, sounds like a delicious recipe! Thank you for the tip.<p class=message>You're welcome! And, if you ever need any more seafood supplies, don't hesitate to come back. We're always here to help.<p class="message sent">Thank you very much. I'll definitely be back. And who knows, maybe we can collaborate in the future!<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. Have a nice day, and good luck with your restaurant!<p class="message sent">Thanks, you too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bed6f81e-c9c5-42e2-a652-0251ce76e66b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
