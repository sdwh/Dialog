I'm a IT consultant and I heard your team is working on automating contract management for the law firm?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct. We're trying to make everything more efficient and organized with automation.<p class=message>That sounds great! What kind of challenges have you guys come across so far?<p class="message sent">Well, one of the main challenges is getting all of the data inputted correctly - it can take a lot of time to do it manually.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Have you considered using any kind of machine learning or natural language processing to streamline inputting information?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have! But we've also been considering using templates for frequently reused phrases.<p class=message>That's definitely a good idea, usage of templates saves a lot of time. May I suggest using an Artificial Intelligence based system to automate document management too?<p class="message sent">That sounds pretty interesting! Do you know of any good systems that are available?<p class=message>Sure, I can recommend a few systems that I've used before. But before that, have you heard of OCR?<p class="message sent">Yes, we've looked into OCR. It's been really helpful for scanning physical documents and turning them into digital ones.<p class=message>That's great! With OCR, we can reduce human error in data inputting. We can also use Natural language processing and OCR together to extract the key data points.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. I'm excited to explore more of these options!<p class=message>Let's try to modify the process with automation and see how it improves the efficiency.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, let's do it! This will save us a lot of time of inputting data and searching information. Thank you for your suggestions.<p class=message>Anytime! It's always exciting to tackle new challenges and explore better ways to do things.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2650362f-4415-4a80-a263-e59a64fc810f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
