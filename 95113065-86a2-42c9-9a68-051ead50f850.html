How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I am doing well, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I am doing great. So, are you ready for today's lesson?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. What are we going to learn about today?<p class=message>We're going to learn about idioms and expressions. Have you heard of the phrase "let the cat out of the bag"?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It means to reveal a secret, right?<p class=message>Exactly! You're a smart student. Can you think of any other idioms using animals?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. How about "hold your horses"? It means to be patient, right?<p class=message>Yes, that's right. You're on a roll! How about "barking up the wrong tree"?<p class="message sent">That means to make a mistake or have the wrong idea, doesn't it?<p class=message>Yes, you really know your idioms. I think you'll do well on the quiz later.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I hope so.<p class=message>By the way, did you hear about the new restaurant that opened up near the school?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class=message>It's called "The Hungry Bear". They serve delicious burgers and fries.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. I'm definitely going to check it out.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. Just make sure you don't "put all your eggs in one basket" and try something else later.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Don't worry, I won't. I love trying new foods.<p class=message>That's great. Well, let's start the lesson now. Good luck!<p class="message sent">Thank you, A! I'm ready to learn.<p class=message>Let's get started then.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=950f849a-86b5-4d9d-8bca-327d15522d7a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
