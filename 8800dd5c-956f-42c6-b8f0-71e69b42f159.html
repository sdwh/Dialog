How's your shift going so far today?<p class="message sent">It's been pretty busy, but I'm keeping up. We've got a lot of orders for burritos and tacos.<p class=message>No surprise there, those are always popular items. How's the customer satisfaction rate?<p class="message sent">It's looking good. Most people seem to be enjoying their meals and asking for extra salsa and guac.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Say, have you tried the new enchiladas we added to the menu last week?<p class="message sent">I haven't yet, but I've heard they're amazing. A couple of customers have given me pretty detailed reviews.<p class=message>Well, why don't you take a little break and try a plate for yourself? It's on the house.<p class="message sent">Awesome! Thanks, I'll definitely give them a try. Speaking of new menu items, have you heard about the chef's special dessert tonight?<p class=message>Ooh, no, do tell!<p class="message sent">It's a chocolate churro sundae with cinnamon whipped cream and berry compote. I'm already drooling.<p class=message>I'm sold. Let's make sure we save a couple of those for ourselves before they sell out.<p class="message sent">Agreed! So, are you doing anything fun after your shift tonight?<p class=message>Actually, I heard there's a new bar that just opened up down the street. I might check it out and have a few drinks.<p class="message sent">Nice, I might join you after I finish up here. But first, more burritos to serve!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=87fba993-2bce-4ea4-a170-c62de0e778e4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
