Please take a seat.<p class="message sent">Thanks, officer. Can I get a cup of coffee?<p class=message>I'm afraid not, sir. We'll have to get down to the business at hand. Are you aware of the charges against you?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know. It was a stupid mistake. I regret it.<p class=message>We've had reports that you were involved in a robbery at the convenience store. Can you explain your whereabouts at the time of the robbery?<p class="message sent">I was at home, officer. Watching TV.<p class=message>That's funny, because we have surveillance footage that shows you at the store. Care to explain?<p class="message sent">Okay, okay. I was there, but I got scared and ran away.<p class=message>Well, you're in quite a pickle now, sir. But don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. Do you need anything?<p class="message sent">Just a lawyer, officer.<p class=message>Don't worry, we'll provide one for you. And maybe next time, think twice before committing a crime.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know. Lesson learned, officer.<p class=message>Good. We'll be in touch. Have a good day, sir.<p class="message sent">Thanks, officer. You too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=854ee955-3703-4c66-9f70-956c7c2ff456.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
