Can you tell me a little bit about your experience in housekeeping?<p class=message>Sure. I've worked as a housekeeper for various hotels and resorts in my hometown. I've also received training on cleaning procedures and safety protocols.<p class="message sent">Great. Have you ever handled special requests from guests, like extra pillows or towels?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I always ensure that the guest's requests are promptly fulfilled and that their stay is comfortable.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. How about your attention to detail? Do you think you're meticulous enough for this job?<p class=message>Absolutely. Cleaning is not just about sweeping and mopping - it's about ensuring that every corner of the room is spotless. I take pride in my work and pay special attention to detail.<p class="message sent">Okay, last question. How would you handle a delicate situation, like discovering items left behind by a guest?<p class=message>I would immediately notify my supervisor and follow the hotel's lost and found policies. Honesty and integrity are important to me, and I believe that's crucial in keeping the trust of the guests.<p class="message sent">Thank you for your answers. Based on your experience and attitude, I believe you would make a great addition to our housekeeping team. We'll get back to you soon.<p class=message>Thank you for the opportunity. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e135680-12aa-4450-8f6e-1c3d78c81d4b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
