Are you Chef B from the airline?<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed. Nice to meet you.<p class=message>Same here. So, let's talk about the inflight meal service. Do you have any preferences for the meals?<p class="message sent">Of course, we always aim to have high-quality meals that taste great at 35,000 feet.<p class=message>Absolutely, I couldn't agree more. But sometimes the altitude affects the taste, right?<p class="message sent">Exactly. That's why we use seasonings and ingredients that are strong in flavor.<p class=message>Ah, I see. What about the presentation? Do you have a specific theme or layout in mind?<p class="message sent">We do actually, we like to serve meals that represent the destinations we fly to.<p class=message>That's a great idea. It adds a personal touch to the inflight experience. Speaking of destinations, what are your favorite ones to fly to?<p class="message sent">That's a tough one, but I have to say Tokyo and New York are among my top choices.<p class=message>Nice choices indeed. Have you tried the sushi in Tokyo or the pizza in New York?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They're both famous for their food and they never disappoint.<p class=message>That's good to know. By the way, I noticed that you have a culinary diploma on your resume. That's impressive!<p class="message sent">Thanks, it was hard work but worth it. I've always loved cooking, and becoming a chef was a dream come true.<p class=message>That's amazing. You're living the dream, Chef B. So, what's your secret ingredient for your signature dish?<p class="message sent">Well, it's a secret (laughs). But I'll tell you this much, it's a blend of spices that pack a flavorful punch.<p class=message>Ooh, sounds intriguing. Maybe I'll have a chance to try it on one of my flights.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's always a pleasure when people enjoy my dishes.<p class=message>Well, I'm sure your meals are a hit with the passengers. Thanks for the chat, Chef B. It was great to talk with a culinary expert like you.<p class="message sent">No, thank you, A. It's always nice to talk about food with someone who appreciates it as much as I do. Have a good day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ae93769b-cc9a-479c-8071-286e2aba00df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
