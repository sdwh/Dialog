Do you want to help me?<p class=message>Sure, I would love to help. What kind of cupcakes are you making?<p class="message sent">I'm making red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting. It's my favorite.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I'm excited to try them. Do you need any help getting started?<p class="message sent">Yes, can you help me sift the dry ingredients? It always takes forever when I do it alone.<p class=message>Of course. Let's get started. What do we need to sift?<p class="message sent">We need to sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.<p class=message>Ok, I'll get the sift and you can start measuring out the ingredients. How much of each do we need?<p class="message sent">We need 2 cups of flour, 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and half a teaspoon of salt.<p class=message>Got it. I think I have everything we need. Let's sift away!<p class="message sent">Great! While we're doing that, can you preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit?<p class=message>Of course. It's always important to make sure the oven is at the right temperature. What's next after we sift the dry ingredients?<p class="message sent">The next step is to cream the butter and sugar together.<p class=message>Cream the butter and sugar? That sounds like a fancy cooking term. How do we do that?<p class="message sent">It's not that hard. We just have to mix the butter and sugar together until it's light and fluffy.<p class=message>Got it. I'm excited to see how this turns out. So, what's the occasion for making these cupcakes?<p class="message sent">There's no particular occasion. I just wanted to make something sweet and yummy for us to enjoy.<p class=message>That sounds like a good enough reason to me. I can't wait to try them!<p class="message sent">Me too! Let's keep going and follow the rest of the recipe step by step.<p class=message>Ok, lead the way. We're in this together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bc46f7eb-863e-4dbb-9454-33abbbede6cd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
