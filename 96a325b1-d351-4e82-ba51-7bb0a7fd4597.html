It's that Korean dish, right? With the marinated slices of beef?<p class=message>Exactly! I had it for the first time last weekend and it was amazing.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, where did you have it?<p class=message>At a Korean restaurant in the city. The meat was so tender and flavorful.<p class="message sent">I've only ever had it at a Korean BBQ place, where you cook the meat yourself. It's always been delicious.<p class=message>It's such a versatile dish too. You can have it with rice, in a wrap, or even in a salad.<p class="message sent">Yes! And it's perfect to share with friends too. I love having a big platter of Bulgogi and sharing it with everyone.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. It's always a hit at parties.<p class="message sent">And have you tried making it at home?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm planning to! I heard it's pretty easy to make and all you really need is the right marinade.<p class="message sent">I've tried making it before using a recipe I found online. It turned out pretty good, but not as good as the restaurant's version.<p class=message>I think that's the case with most dishes. There's just something about restaurant food that we can't replicate at home.<p class="message sent">That's so true. But either way, Bulgogi is always a great choice for a delicious meal.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=969fbdfe-1d52-4e20-bda8-ac5c031e0606.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
