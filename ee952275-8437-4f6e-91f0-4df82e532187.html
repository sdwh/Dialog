I'm doing well. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great. Thanks for asking. Did you have a chance to practice before we started the rehearsal today?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I got some good practice in earlier this morning, but I'm always looking for more opportunities to perfect my skills.<p class=message>That's the spirit! By the way, did you bring that funny hat we talked about wearing during the last song?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yes, I did. I think it will add a nice touch of humor to our performance.<p class=message>Perfect. I think our audience will really appreciate it. So, let's get started with the rehearsal. What do you think we should start with?<p class="message sent">I think we should start with the new original piece you composed. It sounds really amazing and it would be a great way to kick off the show.<p class=message>(smiling) Thanks, B. I'm glad you like it. Alright, let's give it a go!<p class="message sent">Hey, A. I have a suggestion for the second song. How about we incorporate the guitar solo you played at last week's gig into it?<p class=message>(thinks for a moment) Hmmm, that's a great idea. It will definitely add some variety and keep things fresh.<p class=message>Great job, everyone. That was a solid rehearsal. I really feel like we're ready to rock the house in our upcoming show.<p class="message sent">Yeah, amazing job everyone. I love our band.<p class=message>Me too, B. I'll see you guys next time!<p class="message sent">See you, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ee90a73c-4aa7-44bc-9184-bc9bff44eb3f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
