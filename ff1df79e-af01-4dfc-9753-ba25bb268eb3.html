So, what's on the delivery list for today?<p class="message sent">We have some fresh seafood, vegetables, and fruits to deliver to various restaurants in the city.

Maybe we can check it out for lunch sometime.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Speaking of lunch, I brought some homemade sandwiches today.

Thanks, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. So, any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I'm thinking of taking a road trip down to Austin to check out the music scene.
