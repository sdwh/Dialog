What is the reason for your request to change the flight?<p class=message>I'm attending a conference that's been postponed until the following week, so I need to change my flight to match.<p class="message sent">I understand. Let me see what options are available. Would you prefer a direct flight or a flight with a layover?<p class=message>I'd prefer a direct flight, if possible.<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, there are no direct flights available for the date you're requesting. However, there are several flights with a layover that can get you to your destination.<p class=message>Alright, let's go with the one that has the shortest layover.<p class="message sent">Great choice! The flight number is ABC123, and it departs at 9 AM on the 22nd. Would you like me to go ahead and change your reservation?<p class=message>Yes, please. And can you make sure my seat preference is still the same?<p class="message sent">I'll double check on that for you. Just to confirm, you prefer an aisle seat, correct?<p class=message>That's correct.<p class="message sent">Alright, your seat preference has been updated. Is there anything else you need assistance with?<p class=message>No, that's all for now. Thank you so much for your help.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Have a great day and safe travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3debb9d5-d859-41fb-ba84-0042a9456803.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
