I'm in the market for a new suit and I was wondering if you could help me find the perfect one.<p class="message sent">Of course! We have a great selection here. What type of occasion is it for?<p class=message>It's actually for my friend's wedding. I want to look sharp but not too flashy.<p class="message sent">Ah, gotcha. Well, we have some classic styles that would be perfect for a wedding. Let me grab some options for you to try on.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it. I really don't know much about suits, to be honest.<p class="message sent">No worries, that's what I'm here for. How about this grey one? It's a slim fit and looks very modern.<p class=message>Hmm, I'm not sure if grey is my color. Do you have any other options?<p class="message sent">Sure, let me see what else we have...How about this navy blue suit? It has a great pattern on the lining that adds a touch of personality.<p class=message>I love it! This is perfect. How does it feel?<p class="message sent">It looks great on you, and the fit is just right. What do you think?<p class=message>I feel so fancy! I haven't worn a suit in ages. Do you think I could do a little dance in this?<p class="message sent">(laughs) I don't see why not! Give it a try.<p class=message>(starts dancing) Ooh, ah, I feel like James Bond!<p class="message sent">(joins in the dancing) You look like James Bond! I'm glad we found the perfect suit for you.<p class=message>Thank you so much for your help. I'll definitely be coming back here for my next fancy event.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. And feel free to come back any time, even if it's just to show off your moves in your new suit!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=15849118-e5a9-472a-ab0d-60466ba1543e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
