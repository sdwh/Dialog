Do you think it’s worth investing in?<p class=message>Definitely! It’s a great way to ensure your company’s security is top-notch.<p class="message sent">That’s true, but I’m not sure if I want to spend money on something like that right now.<p class=message>But think about the consequences of a security breach. It could cost you a lot more in the long run.<p class="message sent">I see your point. What exactly does the training cover?<p class=message>It covers everything from creating strong passwords, to preventing phishing attacks, and even managing sensitive data.<p class="message sent">That sounds pretty comprehensive. Is it easy to understand?<p class=message>Yes, it’s designed to be easy to follow for all levels of employees. Even the least tech-savvy ones.<p class="message sent">That’s great to hear. How long does the training usually take?<p class=message>It can take anywhere between a few hours to a few days, depending on the level of training you choose.<p class="message sent">Okay, I’ll definitely consider it then. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class=message>You could also consider having a security audit done. It’s an assessment of your company’s security vulnerabilities and can help identify areas that need improvement.<p class="message sent">Oh, that’s interesting. Is it expensive?<p class=message>It could be, but it’s definitely worth it if it helps prevent a security breach.<p class="message sent">Alright, thanks for the advice. I’ll look into both options.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help.
