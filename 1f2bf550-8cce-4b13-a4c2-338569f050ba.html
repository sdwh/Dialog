How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thanks for asking. Are you ready for today's lesson on dinosaurs?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I loved studying about them when I was a kid.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Did you know that scientists recently discovered a new species of dinosaur in Argentina?<p class="message sent">No way, really? What kind of dinosaur is it?<p class=message>It's called Bajadasaurus pronuspinax, and it has long, pointed spikes on its neck for protection.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's amazing. I never would have guessed there were new species still being discovered.<p class=message>There's always something new to learn about! Speaking of which, have you made any plans for the summer yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, I'm still trying to figure out what to do.<p class=message>Well, you could always go on a dinosaur-themed vacation! There are lots of museums and theme parks that have dinosaur exhibits.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I'll have to look into it. But for now, let's focus on our lesson.<p class=message>Of course, let's get started. Did you bring your notes from last week?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I'm ready to learn more about these fascinating creatures.<p class=message>Perfect, let's begin. Did you know that the Tyrannosaurus Rex had the strongest bite force of any animal in history?<p class="message sent">No way, I had no idea! How strong was it?<p class=message>It could crush bones with a force of up to 12,800 pounds per square inch!<p class="message sent">That's incredible. No wonder they were such fierce predators.<p class=message>Yes, but there's still so much we don't know about them. That's why it's important to continue studying and discovering new information.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Learning about dinosaurs is so interesting and fun.<p class=message>I'm glad you think so! Alright, let's get to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1f2bbcda-d3a5-422d-83ef-917c58620cd3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
