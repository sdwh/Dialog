How may I assist you?<p class=message>I am here for the immigration process. I see a lot of people waiting around. Do I need to wait in line?<p class="message sent">Yes, you do. Our team is working diligently to process everyone as quickly as possible. But don't worry, the line moves pretty quickly.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you have any tips for me to make the process smoother?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Make sure you have all your necessary documents ready and easily accessible. It will save you time and effort during the process.<p class=message>Thank you for the advice, I'll make sure to do that. Is there anything else I should be aware of?<p class="message sent">Yes, please make sure your passport has at least six months of validity left. It's a common mistake that causes delays in the process.<p class=message>I will definitely double-check that right now. Thank you for reminding me. So, how long have you been working here?<p class="message sent">I've been working here for about two years now. It's a great place to work, and I enjoy helping people every day.<p class=message>That's so nice to hear. What's the funniest thing that ever happened to you while working here?<p class="message sent">Oh, once a customer accidentally handed me their sandwich instead of their passport. We both got a good laugh out of it, though.<p class=message>Haha, sounds hilarious. Well, thanks for your help. Hopefully, the line moves quickly, and I won't have to bug you again.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Have a great day and enjoy your stay here in the country.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=243d4f8a-9c40-4284-9e3a-7cdac138f497.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
