Nice to see you. Are you also interested in designing a travel application?<p class="message sent">Hey A! Yes, I actually have some experience working on travel apps. What particular feature are you interested in discussing?<p class=message>I would like to discuss the itinerary planning feature. I believe this should be easy and intuitive to use.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Would you like to start with the basics, like setting up the travel dates and destinations, or do you have specific ideas in mind?<p class=message>Hmm, let's start with some basics. What do you think would be the best way to enter travel dates and destinations?<p class="message sent">I think we should use a calendar interface for the dates and allow users to search for their desired destination or choose from a list.<p class=message>That sounds good. We should also include some popular destinations and attractions for users who are not sure where to go.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And for the itinerary, we can give users flexibility to add or remove activities as they wish. We can also show them an estimated travel time and distance to help with planning.<p class=message>Great ideas! And what about sharing the itinerary with friends or family?<p class="message sent">We could allow users to invite others to join the trip and collaborate on the itinerary. Or they could share the itinerary via social media or email.<p class=message>I like that. And what if users want to make changes to their itinerary while on the trip?<p class="message sent">Maybe we could integrate GPS and provide recommendations for nearby attractions and activities that fit in with their existing plans.<p class=message>Wow, you're a genius! I'm so glad we're discussing this together. Let's keep brainstorming.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure, A. I'm looking forward to working on this project together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5294d785-48c4-4261-9e59-ec29160e140c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
