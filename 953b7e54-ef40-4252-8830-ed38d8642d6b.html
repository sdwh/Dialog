Can you tell me more?<p class=message>It's basically a standard for ensuring the protection of sensitive information.<p class="message sent">Oh that sounds important, what kind of information does it cover?<p class=message>It covers everything from personal data to financial information, and even intellectual property.<p class="message sent">Wow, I had no idea it was so comprehensive.<p class=message>Yea, and it's become increasingly important in today's digital age where data breaches can be costly and damaging.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. So what are some of the key requirements for compliance with ISO 27001?<p class=message>Well, one of the main things is information classification, where you need to ensure that data is classified based on its level of sensitivity.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So how do you go about classifying information?<p class=message>Typically, you would create a classification scheme that outlines different levels of sensitivity and then apply it to different types of data.<p class="message sent">That seems like a lot of work.<p class=message>Yea, it can be, but it's worth it in the end to ensure that your sensitive data is properly protected.<p class="message sent">Definitely. So what kind of consequences can there be for non-compliance with ISO 27001?<p class=message>Well, there could be legal and financial penalties, as well as damage to your brand's reputation.<p class="message sent">Yikes, that sounds serious.<p class=message>It is, which is why it's important to take information classification and other requirements seriously.<p class="message sent">Totally agree. Thanks for explaining it to me, A.<p class=message>No problem, always happy to talk about information security!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9538aa02-72d6-4245-a8f1-11d7c3486c6e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
