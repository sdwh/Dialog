I'm excited to hear about the upcoming shows.<p class=message>Yes, so we have a few different options for the next performance. We could do a solo show or collaborate with another artist.<p class="message sent">Personally, I would love to collaborate with someone. It would add a new dynamic to the performance.<p class=message>Great idea! What type of artist do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">Someone who is into experimental music like me, maybe a DJ or a percussionist.<p class=message>I think we can definitely make that happen. Any venue preferences?<p class="message sent">How about a smaller, intimate venue? That way, we can really connect with the audience.<p class=message>Good call. And what about costumes or stage props?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I was thinking something flashy, like neon lights or glittery outfits.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. We'll definitely have to brainstorm some ideas for that.<p class="message sent">I'm excited to see what we can come up with. When do you think we can start rehearsing?<p class=message>I'll check with the venue and see what dates are available. How about we aim to start rehearsing in two weeks?<p class="message sent">Works for me. Thanks for putting this all together, A. This is going to be a great show.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b10d94fb-957c-4804-8266-c71ec6ceffed.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
