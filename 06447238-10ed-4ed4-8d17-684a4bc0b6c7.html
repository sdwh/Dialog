Looks like it's going to be another busy day at the restaurant today.<p class="message sent">Yes, it sure does. But I'm confident that we can handle the crowds.<p class=message>Speaking of handling crowds, did you see that family who came in yesterday with the four kids?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes. They definitely made their presence known.<p class=message>But the kids were so cute! They kept trying all the different dishes and even gave us a thumbs up.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I'm glad we could showcase our wide range of dishes for them.<p class=message>Absolutely. So, what's on the menu for today?<p class="message sent">We're featuring a new Tex-Mex dish and some classic Southern fried chicken.<p class=message>Yum, I can't wait to try both of those. Speaking of trying things, have you sampled our new dessert yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What is it?<p class=message>It's a gooey caramel apple cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing. We should definitely put that on special for tonight's dinner service.<p class=message>Great idea, let's do it! By the way, have you had a chance to check out those new kitchen supplies that just got delivered?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They're going to come in handy for our catering event later this week.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have we finalized the menu for that event yet?<p class="message sent">Almost. We just need to decide on the main course, and then we'll be good to go.<p class=message>Sounds like we have a lot of work to do, but I'm looking forward to it. This is a great team we have here.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We all work hard and have fun while doing it. It's the key to our success.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=06413d65-2b22-4a07-8a8a-e423f74169f6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
