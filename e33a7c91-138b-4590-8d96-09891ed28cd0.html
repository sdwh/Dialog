Today we have with us the incredibly talented musician, B. How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thank you for having me on your show.<p class=message>So, B, tell us a little bit about your music. What inspired you to start creating music?<p class="message sent">Well, I've always loved music and I think it's such an amazing way to connect with people. I started playing guitar when I was a teenager and just fell in love with it. I started writing my own songs and things just sort of took off from there.<p class=message>That's awesome. I think a lot of people can relate to that feeling of falling in love with music. Speaking of which, what are some of your favorite songs to play live?<p class="message sent">Oh man, that's a tough one. I love playing all of my songs, but I think "Sunshine" is one that always gets the crowd going. It's just a really fun, upbeat song.<p class=message>I can definitely see why. It's such a catchy tune. Now, I have to ask, what's the craziest thing that's ever happened to you on tour?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Oh wow, there have been so many crazy moments. One that comes to mind is when we were playing a show in a small town and the power went out in the middle of our set. We ended up finishing the show acoustically and the crowd loved it.<p class=message>That's amazing. It just goes to show that sometimes the unexpected can lead to some really special moments. Well, thank you so much for joining us today, B. It's been a pleasure having you on the show.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me. It's been a blast.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e3312b2a-6038-4324-9af6-aeaa595b8976.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
