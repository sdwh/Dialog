How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">It's been good, thanks for asking. Just diving into some network vulnerability analysis. How about you, A?<p class=message>Same here. Just finished up a few security assessments for some clients.<p class="message sent">Nice. So, have you heard about any interesting attacks in the news lately?<p class=message>Actually, yeah. I read about a hacker who used a smart fridge to send spam emails.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You're kidding me! The Internet of Things strikes again.<p class=message>Yeah, apparently the fridge was connected to a vulnerable network and the hacker used it as a launching pad for their attack.<p class="message sent">That's wild. It just goes to show that hackers really will exploit any weakness they can find.<p class=message>Definitely. It's important that we stay on top of things and work to identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Speaking of vulnerabilities, have you seen the latest report on SQL injection attacks?<p class=message>No, but I'm definitely interested. What's the latest?<p class="message sent">Well, it looks like SQL injection attacks are still one of the top vulnerabilities in web applications.<p class=message>(sighs) I feel like that's been the case forever. Developers really need to get better at preventing these types of attacks.<p class="message sent">Agreed. But at least we have job security, right?<p class=message>(laughs) Yes, that's one way to look at it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ae9cee65-7140-468b-898b-fe269e1df4dd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
