What medication is it?<p class="message sent">It's for my allergies. The label says to take it twice a day.<p class=message>Alright, and what time did your doctor say to take it? Morning or night?<p class="message sent">The doctor didn't say, but I was thinking of taking it in the morning and evening.<p class=message>That sounds good, just make sure to take it at the same times every day to ensure maximum effectiveness.<p class="message sent">Will do. And what about food? Should I take it with or without food?<p class=message>It depends on the medication. Let me check... Ah yes, this one is best taken with food to avoid upset stomach.<p class="message sent">Okay, thanks for letting me know.<p class=message>You're welcome. And remember not to skip any doses, even if you start feeling better. Also, don't stop taking it until your doctor says it's okay to do so.<p class="message sent">Got it. How long should I take it for?<p class=message>Your doctor should have told you, but generally you should finish the full course of treatment.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll double-check with my doctor. Thanks for your help.<p class=message>You're welcome, happy to help anytime.
