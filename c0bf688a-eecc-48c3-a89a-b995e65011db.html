Can you help me out?<p class=message>Sure, let's take a look. Hmm, I think I remember this from high school.<p class="message sent">That was a long time ago, Mom.<p class=message>Hey, watch it! I'm not that old yet.<p class="message sent">Haha, sorry. So how do we solve it?<p class=message>Well, we need to use the Pythagorean Theorem.<p class="message sent">The what theorem?<p class=message>The Pythagorean Theorem. It's a formula to find the length of the sides of a right triangle.<p class="message sent">Cool, I didn't know that. Thanks for teaching me, Mom.<p class=message>No problem, that's what I'm here for. So, how was your day at school?<p class="message sent">It was good. We did some experiments in science class.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. What did you learn?<p class="message sent">We learned about chemical reactions and how to make a volcano explode.<p class=message>Wow, that's pretty cool. Did you get to see it happen?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it was awesome! The volcano erupted and lava went everywhere.<p class=message>Sounds like quite the spectacle. Did you get any on you?<p class="message sent">Just a little bit, but it's okay. I was wearing my lab coat.<p class=message>Good thinking. You don't want to ruin your clothes.<p class="message sent">Yeah, definitely not. Thanks for reminding me to bring it home.<p class=message>No problem. Do you need help with any other homework?<p class="message sent">Actually, I think I'm good for now. Thanks again, Mom.<p class=message>Anytime, sweetie. Just let me know if you need me to explain anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c0ac33ee-0cd5-4436-8547-57e129a47e8b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
