I'm A, the owner of this Chinese bakery. Nice to meet you, B. You're the one in charge of the soy milk here, right?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Yes, that's right! I heard your Chinese pastries are very famous here in Osaka.<p class=message>Yes, we're quite famous among the Chinese community here, but we also have a lot of Japanese customers who love our breakfast items. Speaking of which, would you like to try some of our freshly made shaobing with your soy milk?<p class="message sent">That sounds great! Actually, I've always been curious about how you make those delicious flatbreads.<p class=message>It's a secret recipe passed down from my family in China. We use only the freshest ingredients and hand-roll each shaobing until they're perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive! And as for my soy milk, it's made from organic soybeans and filtered water. I'm really passionate about using healthy and natural ingredients.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that! We have something in common. I'm also passionate about preserving the traditional craftsmanship of making Chinese pastries. It's not an easy job, but seeing happy customers enjoying our food makes it all worth it.<p class="message sent">Yes, I completely agree! That's why I love working in the food industry. It's so rewarding to see people enjoy what we create.<p class=message>Absolutely! And speaking of customers, we have some regulars who come in every morning for their fix of shaobing and soy milk. It's nice to see familiar faces every day.<p class="message sent">Yes, I also have some loyal customers who swear by our soy milk. They say it's the best in Osaka!<p class=message>Haha, well, I'm sure it's pretty good. But I think my shaobing might give your soy milk a run for its money.<p class="message sent">Oh, really? Well, we'll have to let the customers decide!<p class=message>Agreed! And who knows, maybe someday we can do a collaboration and make some delicious breakfast set together.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea, A! Let's keep in touch and see what we can come up with.<p class=message>Definitely! It was great meeting you, B.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. And thank you for the shaobing. They're really good!<p class=message>You're welcome! See you soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=59a046b6-34c3-47dd-9a9a-7f2e8761928f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
