I'm an internet engineer, and I'm excited to work on this electronic voting system.<p class="message sent">Great to meet you too. As a systems administrator, I appreciate the importance of a secure and reliable system.<p class=message>Absolutely. We need to make sure that the system is able to handle a high volume of traffic while remaining secure.<p class="message sent">Yes, we should implement strict authentication and authorization procedures to ensure that only authorized persons can access the system.<p class=message>I completely agree.
