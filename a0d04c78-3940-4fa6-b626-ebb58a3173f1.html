We'll take care of you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, it's reassuring to hear that.<p class=message>So, what have you been doing to pass the time?<p class="message sent">Oh, I've been binge-watching Netflix and trying to beat my high score on Candy Crush.<p class=message>Sounds like fun. What have you been watching on Netflix?<p class="message sent">I've been watching a lot of comedies lately. Trying to keep my spirits up.<p class=message>That's a good idea. Laughter is the best medicine, after all.<p class="message sent">Haha, true. Speaking of which, do you have any good jokes?<p class=message>Hmm, let me think...why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? Because it was two-tired!<p class="message sent">Haha, good one. You should be a comedian!<p class=message>Thank you, but I think I'll stick to nursing for now.<p class="message sent">Fair enough. You're doing a great job at that, by the way.<p class=message>Thank you, I appreciate that. Is there anything else I can get for you?<p class="message sent">No, I'm good for now. Just looking forward to getting out of here soon.<p class=message>I don't blame you. We'll do everything we can to make sure your recovery goes smoothly.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I really appreciate it.<p class=message>Anytime.
