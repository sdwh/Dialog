Have you thought of any initial measures we could take?<p class=message>Well, one suggestion is to implement a two-factor authentication process to access sensitive information. This way, only authorized personnel can access the data.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. We could also provide regular cybersecurity training to all staff members to ensure they are aware of potential threats and how to avoid them.<p class=message>Another idea is to limit the amount of personal data we collect from students and staff. The less information we have stored, the less risk of exposure.<p class="message sent">It's important to have a good data retention policy in place to determine what information is necessary to keep and for how long.<p class=message>That's true. We could also encrypt the data we do keep to add an extra layer of protection against hackers.<p class="message sent">Yes, we should be proactive in identifying and mitigating any potential vulnerabilities in our system.<p class=message>Agreed. It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to data protection.<p class="message sent">And let's not forget to regularly test and audit our system to ensure it's functioning properly and meeting all security standards.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's vital that we create a culture of security awareness and take any necessary steps to protect the valuable personal information in our care.<p class="message sent">Well said, A. I look forward to working with you to implement these measures and keep our school's data secure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=86f3029c-7703-4d54-9b5f-3d3f457f42e4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
