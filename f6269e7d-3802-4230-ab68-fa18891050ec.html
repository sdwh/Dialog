But it needs some maintenance.<p class=message>That's why we're lucky to have you here, B. What's the issue?<p class="message sent">It seems like a belt in the transmission system needs to be replaced. I have a spare one in my toolbox.<p class=message>Great, let's replace it. By the way, have you ever driven a tractor before?<p class="message sent">To be honest, I haven't. I mostly deal with fixing the machines.<p class=message>In that case, you're in for a treat. Let me give you a quick lesson on tractor driving.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm open to learning new things.<p class=message>First, you need to engage the clutch and shift into the lowest gear. Then slowly ease off the clutch while pressing the gas pedal.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. It's similar to driving a manual car.<p class=message>Exactly. Now let's see how well you handle the plow. We need to prepare the field for planting.<p class="message sent">I'm up for the challenge. Can't wait to see the results of our hard work.<p class=message>That's the spirit, B. You know what they say, "Happy farmer, happy life."<p class="message sent">Haha, you got that right. Working in the countryside has its own charm and peace.<p class=message>Yeah, nothing beats the smell of freshly mowed hay and the sound of cows mooing.<p class="message sent">It feels good to be a part of an industry that helps nourish a nation.<p class=message>Absolutely. We play an important role in ensuring that people have access to nutritious food. Now let's go get that plowing done!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f6261356-fc59-4bf5-97ea-aed40134b5e8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
