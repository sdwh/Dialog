I heard we're both working on the cloud deployment for this bank's applications.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. It's been quite a challenge, but I think we're getting there.<p class=message>Definitely. I'm a cloud engineer myself, so I'm glad I can help out with this project.<p class="message sent">That's great! As a DevOps engineer, my main priority is to ensure that the applications are deployed smoothly and efficiently.<p class=message>I totally understand. So, have you had any experience with deploying banking applications on the cloud?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It can be a bit tricky, especially with all the security requirements, but it's definitely doable.<p class=message>Oh, that's good to hear. I've been working on optimizing the cloud infrastructure, so I can assist with that too.<p class="message sent">Wow, you sound like quite the expert! By the way, have you heard any good jokes lately?<p class=message>Haha, sure have! Why did the accountant cross the road?<p class="message sent">I don't know, why?<p class=message>To get to the other side of the balance sheet! Get it?<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's pretty good! Here's one for you: why don't scientists trust atoms?<p class=message>I don't know, why?<p class="message sent">Because they make up everything!<p class=message>(laughs) That's a classic one! Thanks for the laugh. Now, let's get back to work and deploy these banking applications on the cloud!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4a4b00cb-a146-4b38-b31d-f0f94cfb5255.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
