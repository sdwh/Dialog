How about you?<p class=message>Same here, Github is saving my life on this project.<p class="message sent">I know right! Github is like a superhero for developers.<p class=message>Haha, I couldn't agree more. Have you ever lost your code before?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, yes! It was a long time ago, but I still remember the feeling of devastation.<p class=message>I hear you, that feeling is the worst. That's why I make sure to push my code to Github regularly.<p class="message sent">Good idea, that's a lesson I learned the hard way. Hey, did you hear about that new coding bootcamp that opened up downtown?<p class=message>Yeah, I heard about it. Have you ever considered going to a bootcamp?<p class="message sent">Actually, I've been thinking about it. I hear they can really help level up your skills.<p class=message>That's true. But we also learn a lot on the job too, don't you think?<p class="message sent">Definitely, but sometimes it's nice to have a structured learning environment. Plus, it can be a good way to network with other developers.<p class=message>Agreed, networking is always important in this field. Hey, speaking of networking, have you been to any developer conferences lately?<p class="message sent">Not recently, but I'm thinking about attending one next month. Have you been to any good ones?<p class=message>Yeah, I went to one last year that had some really great speakers. Plus, the swag was pretty cool too.<p class="message sent">Haha, swag is always a plus! Which conference was it?<p class=message>It was the Code Conference in San Francisco. If you have the chance, I highly recommend it.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendation, I'll definitely look into it. Oh shoot, looks like we both have a merge conflict on this code. Let's take a closer look.<p class=message>Right, let's get to work. Thanks for the chat, B. It's always nice to talk with a fellow developer.<p class="message sent">Same here, A. Let's get this code merged and grab a coffee later.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4bf17bd8-4269-431c-8e52-0018aa2ea03b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
