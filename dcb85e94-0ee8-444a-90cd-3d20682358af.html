How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It was great, I went on a road trip with some friends. How about yours?<p class=message>Oh, it was relaxing. I finally had some time to catch up on my favorite TV show. So, how is the project we assigned you going?<p class="message sent">It's going well, I finished researching and I'm now working on the report.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you need any help?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I'm having trouble analyzing the data.<p class=message>No problem, let's take a look together after the meeting. Speaking of the meeting, do you have the agenda?<p class="message sent">Yes, I printed it out this morning. I also made copies for everyone attending.<p class=message>You're a real go-getter, B. I'm glad we hired you as our intern.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. I'm really enjoying the work here. It's a great learning experience.<p class=message>I'm happy to hear that. Is there anything else you need to complete the project?<p class="message sent">Not really, but I was thinking of adding some graphs to the report.<p class=message>That's a great idea. It will make it more visually appealing. Do you have the software to create them?<p class="message sent">Yes, I downloaded a trial version of a graphing software. It's easy to use.<p class=message>Perfect, can you show me how it works?<p class="message sent">Of course, I can give you a quick demo after lunch.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let's get back to work now, we have a lot to do.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A. Let's tackle this project together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dcb3fd2e-c22c-4a98-91cc-65a5cbd48a1f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
