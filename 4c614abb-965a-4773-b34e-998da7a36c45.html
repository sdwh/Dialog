I heard you're a machine vision engineer. How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm doing great. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing fine. We've been having some issues with our logistics company lately. I was hoping you could help me with creating a better cargo tracking system.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. What kind of system are you using at the moment?<p class=message>We're using a scanning system that reads the barcodes on the cargo, but it's not very accurate and often delays the sorting process.<p class="message sent">Have you considered using a machine vision system that can read the labels and tags on the cargo?<p class=message>Yes actually, that's why I wanted to speak with you. What do you suggest we do?<p class="message sent">We could develop a system that uses AI to identify the unique features of each package, like its shape, size and color. Then, we can use that information to track it throughout the entire logistics process.<p class=message>That sounds great. Would it be expensive to implement?<p class="message sent">It depends on the technology we use, but we could definitely come up with an affordable solution. We could also build in features that can detect damage or tampering to the cargo during transit.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. I had no idea we had such technology available. How long do you think it will take to develop?<p class="message sent">It could take a few months, but it's definitely possible. We'll have to work closely with your logistics team to ensure that the system meets all their needs.<p class=message>Of course, I'll make sure to introduce you to our logistics manager. This is going to change the way our company operates.<p class="message sent">I'm excited to get started. It's going to be great to see how much we can improve the efficiency of the company with this new system.<p class=message>Yes, and once we're done, we can celebrate with a big party. I'll bring the food, you bring the drinks!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a deal. Let's get started right away!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4c60e42e-914d-4841-a625-e44dddbf5572.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
