I'm a network engineer. Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi, nice to meet you too. I'm a system administrator. So, you're here to talk about optimizing our school's network system, right?<p class=message>Yes, that's correct. How is the current network system in the school working?<p class="message sent">Well, there are some issues with the speed and connectivity, especially during peak hours when a lot of students are using the internet.<p class=message>I see. Have you thought about expanding the bandwidth or upgrading the hardware?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we have but it's not in our budget right now.<p class=message>Hmm, what about implementing some network management tools to prioritize certain applications or limit the bandwidth usage during peak hours?<p class="message sent">That's a great suggestion. Do you have any specific tools in mind?<p class=message>Yes, there are several options like NetFlow Analyzer, PRTG, and SolarWinds that have features for managing bandwidth and network traffic.<p class="message sent">Good to know. I'll definitely look into those tools. By the way, what do you enjoy doing in your free time?<p class=message>I love hiking and exploring new trails. How about you?<p class="message sent">I'm an amateur photographer, so I enjoy taking pictures of landscapes and nature.<p class=message>That's awesome! Maybe we should go on a hike together and take some pictures.<p class="message sent">Sure, sounds like a plan. Let's set a day when we're both free.<p class=message>Great, I look forward to it. Thanks for the chat, it was nice getting to know you.<p class="message sent">Same here. Good luck with optimizing our school's network system.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=647a04f4-fe6e-4dda-b92f-dae65769666e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
