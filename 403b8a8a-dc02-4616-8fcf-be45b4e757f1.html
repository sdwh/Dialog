I heard you're a game developer. What kind of games do you make?<p class="message sent">Hey! Nice to meet you. I specialize in creating role-playing games. How about you?<p class=message>Oh, I'm a huge fan of RPGs! What's the latest game you're working on?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm developing a new RPG that will have a character creation system. Players can customize their characters' appearance, abilities, and personality.<p class=message>That sounds awesome! I always spend hours on character creation. What kind of customization options will be available?<p class="message sent">Well, players can choose different races and classes for their characters, and then select from a variety of hairstyles, clothes, and accessories. They can also allocate stat points and choose a backstory for their character.<p class=message>That's really detailed! Will there be any non-human races available?<p class="message sent">Yes, there will be several non-human races to choose from, such as elves, dwarves, and even some new ones that we're creating.<p class=message>Nice! Will there be any special abilities or spells exclusive to certain races or classes?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Each race and class will have its own unique abilities and spells that players can use in combat.<p class=message>Sweet! Will there be any online multiplayer mode?<p class="message sent">Yes, the game will have a co-op mode where players can team up with friends to complete quests and fight bosses together.<p class=message>That sounds like a blast! Do you have an estimated release date?<p class="message sent">We're aiming to release the game in about six months. It's still in development, but we're making good progress.<p class=message>I can't wait to play it. Thanks for the preview!<p class="message sent">No problem, thanks for your interest! We're putting a lot of effort into making this game the best it can be.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4036b44f-ee7a-45d1-829f-265a997aaee8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
