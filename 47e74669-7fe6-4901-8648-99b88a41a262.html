Do you need a hand with that machine maintenance?<p class="message sent">Hey A, thanks for offering. Actually, I could use some help. This machine seems to be giving me a headache.<p class=message>Yeah, I can see that. It looks like some of the parts are worn down. Have you tried checking the manual?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but it's hard to follow. It's like it's written in another language.<p class=message>(laughs) I know what you mean. It's like they expect us to know everything about these machines.<p class="message sent">(smiling) I feel like this machine has a mind of its own. Maybe we should call the Ghostbusters!<p class=message>(laughs) That would definitely make our job easier. Unfortunately, we'll have to stick with good old-fashioned elbow grease.<p class="message sent">(nodding) Alright then, let's get started. I'm glad I have you here to help me out. At least we can chat while we work.<p class=message>(smiling) That's the spirit. It's always better to tackle problems together. Plus, it gives me an excuse to take a break from my desk job.<p class="message sent">(grinning) I hear you. It's good to get some fresh air once in a while. At least you don't have to deal with all this grease on your hands every day.<p class=message>(smirking) You got me there. But you know what they say, "dirty hands means a day well spent!"<p class="message sent">(laughing) That's true. Alright, let's get back to work. I'm hoping this baby will be up and running in no time.<p class=message>(nodding) Agreed. And if not, we can always try some Ghostbusting as a backup plan.<p class="message sent">(laughing) You got it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=47e2e4b9-0cfd-410d-b9f9-572608f17b3c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
