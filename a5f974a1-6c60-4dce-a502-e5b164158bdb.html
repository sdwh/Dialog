Great weather we have today, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. And a great day to go to Tianjin! How can I be of service to you today, sir/madam?<p class=message>Actually, I'm on my way to the famous Ancient Culture Street in Tianjin. Do you know the place?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. It's a famous tourist spot in Tianjin. Have you been there before?<p class=message>No, it's my first time in Tianjin. I'm really excited to explore the street and try some local street food. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Oh, you have to try the Goubuli Baozi, which is a famous steamed bun in Tianjin. And, you should also try the Mahua, which is a sweet and crispy snack.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! I'll make sure to try them both. By the way, how long have you been a taxi driver in Tianjin?<p class="message sent">For almost 10 years now. It's been a great job, and I get to meet people from all over the world.<p class=message>That's amazing! What's the most interesting story you have with a passenger?<p class="message sent">Well, there was this one time when a passenger asked me to take them to the Great Wall of China, which is about two hours away from Tianjin. They were surprised when I told them that the Great Wall wasn't actually visible from space!<p class=message>(chuckles) I hope they were good sports about it.<p class="message sent">Yes, they were. We ended up having a great conversation about the history of the Great Wall all the way there.<p class=message>Wow, that's really interesting. You seem to have a lot of knowledge about Tianjin and its history.<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. I love this city and everything about it. It's a great place to live and work in.<p class=message>I can see why. Well, we're almost there. Thank you for the great ride and wonderful conversation, driver B.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, sir/madam. Thank you for taking a ride with me. Enjoy your time in Tianjin!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a5f4bf64-6e2b-4e4f-b6e5-56bd3e2d34bd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
