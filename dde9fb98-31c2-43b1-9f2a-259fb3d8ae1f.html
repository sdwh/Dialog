We’ll work on your serves and spikes today.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Do you have any tips for serving?<p class=message>Sure thing. First, hold the ball in your non-dominant hand and toss it up with your dominant hand. Then, make contact with the ball at the highest point with a flat hand.<p class="message sent">Got it. And what about spiking?<p class=message>Well, the key is to have a good approach. Take a few steps back, then a few forward and jump high. Aim for the sweet spot of the ball with a firm hand.<p class="message sent">Okay, I’ll keep that in mind.<p class=message>Don’t worry, you’ll get the hang of it soon enough. Just keep practicing regularly.<p class="message sent">I will. This is such a fun way to stay active and fit.<p class=message>Yes, it certainly beats hitting the gym. Plus, you get to enjoy the beautiful scenery and fresh air.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And it’s even better when you have an enthusiastic coach like you, Coach A.<p class=message>(laughs) Thanks, B. You’re too kind.<p class="message sent">No, seriously. You make the drills and practices a lot of fun.<p class=message>Aw, shucks. That’s very nice of you to say.<p class="message sent">Okay, I think I’m ready to try serving now.<p class=message>Go for it, B. Remember to stay relaxed and keep your eye on the ball.<p class="message sent">Here goes nothing. (tosses ball up and serves) Yes! I did it!<p class=message>Great job, B! That was a pretty decent serve.<p class="message sent">(beaming with pride) Thanks, Coach A. I couldn’t have done it without your help.<p class=message>My pleasure. Let’s keep up the good work and improve even more next time.<p class="message sent">You got it, Coach A. Thanks again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dde94732-0c3c-49c3-84f5-c18b7e256837.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
