It's a pretty big deal these days, isn't it?<p class=message>Definitely. It's all about making sure that companies are keeping their systems secure and minimizing risks.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been reading about it. It seems like more companies are becoming ISO 27001 certified to ensure their security protocols are up to standard.<p class=message>That's right. It's becoming more and more essential to have proper security measures in place.<p class="message sent">Agreed. With all of the hacks and data breaches that have happened over the years, it's important to stay vigilant.<p class=message>Exactly. So, have you ever been involved in setting up an ISO 27001 compliant security monitoring system?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I actually have some experience with that. It can be pretty complex, but it's definitely worth it.<p class=message>Nice! Any tips for those of us just starting out?<p class="message sent">Well, the key is to identify all of the potential risks and vulnerabilities first. And then, implement proper controls and monitoring measures to mitigate those risks.<p class=message>I see. So, what kind of controls and monitoring measures are typically used?<p class="message sent">It depends on the company and its specific needs, but things like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security information and event management tools are commonly used.<p class=message>Makes sense. So, what kind of challenges have you faced when setting up a security monitoring system?<p class="message sent">One challenge is getting everyone in the organization on board with the process. It can require a lot of buy-in from various departments and stakeholders.<p class=message>Yeah, I can imagine. It's important that everyone understands the importance of security.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And another challenge is keeping up with the evolving threats and technologies. You need to stay up to date to ensure your security measures remain effective.<p class=message>Great advice, B. Thanks for sharing your expertise.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's important that we all work together to keep our systems and data safe.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4efd6208-8939-4813-aeed-cc5cda4638d8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
