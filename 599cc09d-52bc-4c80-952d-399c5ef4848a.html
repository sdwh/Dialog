I have a terrible headache and my throat is sore.<p class=message>I'm sorry to hear that. Let's take a look. Hmm.. it seems like you have a cold. Nothing to worry about. Have you been taking any medication for it?<p class="message sent">No, not yet.<p class=message>Alright, then let me prescribe you some medication that will make you feel better. And if it gets worse, make sure to come back and see me.<p class="message sent">Thank you, doctor. Do you have any advice for me?<p class=message>Yes, make sure to drink lots of fluids and rest as much as you can. And don't forget to wear a mask to avoid spreading the germs.<p class="message sent">I will, thank you. Do you have any funny or interesting stories to help me cheer up?<p class=message>Actually, I do have a funny story. Did you hear about the guy who invented lifesavers?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's the story?<p class=message>Well, he created them as a candy for people who smoke so they could have something to suck on instead of a cigarette. But the funny thing is that he never smoked himself!<p class="message sent">Haha! That's hilarious. Thanks for sharing, doctor. You always know how to make me feel better.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. And remember, laughter is the best medicine!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=59994932-dca2-4fc8-934b-01569e222d10.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
