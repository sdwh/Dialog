How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Dr. A! I'm doing great, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good too. So, what brings you here today?<p class="message sent">I just need to get my blood pressure checked. It's been a while since my last check-up.<p class=message>Sure, no problem. We can do that right away. Have you had your coffee yet this morning?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. Is that going to affect my blood pressure reading?<p class=message>It might, but don't worry. We'll just take note of it and take it into consideration.<p class="message sent">Okay, sounds good. And how's your day going so far, Doctor?<p class=message>It's been busy, but nothing I can't handle. You know how it is.<p class="message sent">Tell me about it. These early morning appointments can be tough sometimes.<p class=message>Yeah, especially when you're a night owl like me. But it's all part of the job, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, what fun plans do you have for the weekend?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of going hiking on Saturday. How about you?<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds nice! I'm actually going to a friend's barbecue on Saturday. Hopefully the weather holds up.<p class=message>Sounds like a great time. Don't forget to put on some sunscreen!<p class="message sent">Will do, thanks for the reminder. Alright, my blood pressure looks good. Thanks, Doctor.<p class=message>You're welcome, Nurse. Take care and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b0de76c7-20a0-4e52-94f2-10f792047d30.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
