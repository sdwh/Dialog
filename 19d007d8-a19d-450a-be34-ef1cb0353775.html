How did it go?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it was quite an experience! The reporter had a lot of interesting questions for me.<p class=message>That sounds exciting! What did they ask you about?<p class="message sent">We talked about my work and my hobbies. They even asked me about my favorite food!<p class=message>Wow, they really got to know you well. Did you feel nervous at all?<p class="message sent">At first, I was a bit nervous, but the reporter was really friendly and made me feel comfortable.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Did they ask you any tough questions?<p class="message sent">Actually, there was this one question that caught me off guard. They asked me about my biggest fear!<p class=message>Oh no, what did you say?<p class="message sent">Well, I had to think for a moment, but then I said my biggest fear is running out of chocolate!<p class=message>Haha, that's too funny. I'm sure the reporter enjoyed that answer.<p class="message sent">Yeah, they laughed and said it was a unique response. Overall, it was a fun experience.<p class=message>That's awesome. Who knows, maybe you'll become a celebrity after the article comes out!<p class="message sent">Hah, I highly doubt that. But it's always nice to have a little moment of fame, right?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=19c23ddf-752b-4bcf-81ab-70dfb61b6edb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
