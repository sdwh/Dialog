How's everything going today?<p class="message sent">Great, thanks for asking. We've had quite a few happy customers so far.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Any feedback from them that we can use to improve?<p class="message sent">Actually, one customer loved the steak but requested it be cooked a bit less next time. Other than that, everyone seems really happy with their meals.<p class=message>Good to know. We'll make sure to relay that to the kitchen. So, any plans for your free time later?<p class="message sent">Not really, just planning to go home and relax. Maybe watch a movie or something.<p class=message>Sounds like a good plan. Have you seen any good movies lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I saw the latest Marvel movie and it was amazing! Have you seen it?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've heard good things about it. Maybe I'll have to check it out myself.<p class="message sent">Definitely worth it! Oh, and speaking of movies, I had a customer suggest we start doing monthly movie nights here at the restaurant. What do you think?<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can have a special menu and themed drinks to go along with it. Let's talk to the team and start planning.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Speaking of which, do you think we could add some new drinks to the menu soon? Customers always love trying something new.<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's brainstorm some ideas and see what we can come up with. I trust your taste buds, B.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I'll start working on some ideas after my shift today.<p class=message>Excellent. Keep up the good work, B. Our customers are lucky to have such a dedicated and friendly server.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=32071ab6-d38b-4edc-9192-ed3e7007d946.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
