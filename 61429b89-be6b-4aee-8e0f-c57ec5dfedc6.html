It's a standard for information security management, right?<p class=message>Exactly! It's all about keeping your network safe from cyber attacks and data breaches.<p class="message sent">Well, that sounds like something every company should be implementing.<p class=message>Definitely. But sometimes it can be tough to get everyone on board with new security measures.<p class="message sent">I know what you mean. Some people think that their passwords are strong enough when they're really not.<p class=message>Ha, yeah. I remember hearing about someone who used "password" as their password.<p class="message sent">No way! That's like putting a "kick me" sign on your back.<p class=message>Seriously, it's like asking for trouble. But with ISO 27001, you're required to have strong passwords and other security measures in place.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. But what about the cost? Isn't implementing these security measures expensive?<p class=message>It can be, but the cost of a data breach or cyber attack can be even more expensive in the long run.<p class="message sent">That's true. It's always better to be safe than sorry.<p class=message>Exactly. And with ISO 27001, you'll have peace of mind knowing that your network is secure.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a win-win to me!<p class=message>Definitely. It's always worth investing in the security of your company and your customers' data.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Thanks for the info, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to chat about network security!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6141b698-3dc3-49e5-8bd7-c466b41cb55c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
