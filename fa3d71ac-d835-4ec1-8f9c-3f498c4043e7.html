I don't think we've met before, I'm a research scientist here. What brings you to the lab?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm B, the new intern. Nice to meet you! I'm here to learn as much as I can about the research process and see if this is something I want to pursue.<p class=message>That's great! We're working on a really interesting project right now. We're trying to develop a new drug to treat a common type of cancer.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like important work. What stage are you at in the development process?<p class=message>Right now, we're in the preclinical stage, which means we're testing the drug on animals to make sure it's safe and effective before we move on to human trials.<p class="message sent">So, you're testing it on mice and rats?<p class=message>Yes, that's right. We have to make sure it's safe in animals first before we can even think about testing it on humans.<p class="message sent">I see. What kind of results have you seen so far?<p class=message>It's still early days, but we're getting some promising results. The drug seems to be shrinking the tumors in the animals we've tested it on, which is really exciting.<p class="message sent">That's great! I'm really looking forward to learning more about this project and the research process in general.<p class=message>Of course, we're happy to have you on board. Make sure to ask lots of questions and learn as much as you can while you're here.<p class="message sent">Will do, thanks!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fa3d66be-2158-435b-a321-3f15e8ad2c67.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
