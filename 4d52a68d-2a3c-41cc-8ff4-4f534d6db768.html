How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">I need a haircut. Nothing too drastic, just a trim.<p class=message>Sure thing! Have a seat and we'll get started.<p class="message sent">So, how long have you been a hairstylist?<p class=message>Oh, I've been cutting hair for about 10 years now. I enjoy it because I get to meet new people every day.<p class="message sent">That's great! What's the latest hair trend these days?<p class=message>Right now, blunt bobs and shaggy layers are really popular. But I like to give my customers a style that suits their personality and lifestyle.<p class="message sent">I trust your judgement. Just don't cut off too much!<p class=message>Don't worry, I'll make sure to leave enough length. So, what do you do for a living?<p class="message sent">I'm a teacher. It's challenging but rewarding.<p class=message>I have a lot of respect for teachers. They play such an important role in shaping the future generation.<p class="message sent">Thank you! So, what made you want to become a hairstylist?<p class=message>I actually started cutting my own hair when I was a teenager and found that I enjoyed it. So, I decided to make a career out of it.<p class="message sent">That's impressive! You're doing what you love.<p class=message>I definitely am! And I love seeing my customers happy with their new haircuts.<p class="message sent">Me too! Thanks for making me look good.<p class=message>You're welcome. It was my pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4d4f737d-7565-4bf0-a262-ceb8e1afae8b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
