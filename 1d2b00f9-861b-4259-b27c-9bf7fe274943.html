How's business?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, thanks. And yours?<p class=message>Same here. Have you tried my chicken rice yet? It's delicious!<p class="message sent">I haven't had the chance, but I'm sure it's great. My soy milk pairs perfectly with your chicken rice though!<p class=message>Absolutely! Hey, have you ever thought about combining our dishes for a breakfast set?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Your chicken rice and my soy milk would make a perfect combo.<p class=message>And we could offer a reasonable price for both dishes. I'm sure it'll attract more customers.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Let's give it a try tomorrow.<p class=message>Sure thing. By the way, I heard that you add ginger to your soy milk. Is that true?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. Ginger adds a mild spicy taste and some health benefits to the soy milk.<p class=message>Wow, I never knew that. I'm definitely going to try it next time.<p class="message sent">Please do! And I've heard your chicken rice is cooked with pandan leaves. How does that affect the taste?<p class=message>Pandan leaves give the chicken a fragrant and slightly sweet flavor. It's a must-try!<p class="message sent">I've been missing out. Let's exchange portions tomorrow and try each other's dishes.<p class=message>Deal! And hey, we could also offer a breakfast combo that includes both our dishes and some sides.<p class="message sent">Yum! Customers would love that. Your chicken rice, my soy milk, some boiled eggs and some fried fritters would make a great set.<p class=message>Now you're talking! We should definitely start promoting it as our specialty breakfast.<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do that. Working together and innovating our menus will benefit both of us.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Looking forward to our collaboration tomorrow. Cheers!<p class="message sent">Cheers to a successful partnership!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1d2933ed-dc36-4090-8590-fa36570c39bf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
