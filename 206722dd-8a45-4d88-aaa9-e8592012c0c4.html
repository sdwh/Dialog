I am feeling a bit under the weather. I have got a cough and a sore throat.<p class=message>I see. Let me have a look at your throat. Hmm...it's red and inflamed.<p class="message sent">Is it serious, doctor?<p class=message>Not really, you probably have a viral infection. I will prescribe some medication to ease your symptoms.<p class="message sent">Thank you, doctor. I have to say, this is my first visit to a doctor in a very long time.<p class=message>Really? Well, it's always better to get yourself checked out.<p class="message sent">I suppose so. I don't particularly enjoy being poked and prodded, though.<p class=message>(Laughs) Well, nobody really enjoys it, but it's necessary.<p class="message sent">I am just glad it's a relatively minor issue.<p class=message>Absolutely. Just try to rest and take the medication as prescribed.<p class="message sent">Will do, doctor. Thanks for your help.<p class=message>Not a problem. Anything else you would like to discuss?<p class="message sent">No, that's it, I think. Oh actually, I do have a question.<p class=message>Sure, what's on your mind?<p class="message sent">Is it true that laughter is the best medicine?<p class=message>(Grinning) Well, it certainly can't hurt. Humor has been proven to have a positive impact on mental and physical health.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. I will make sure to laugh a little more often.<p class=message>(Smiling) That's the spirit. Take care and see you next time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=206403eb-f520-4c94-898c-58f170ecea22.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
