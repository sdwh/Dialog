I'm a solo traveler and I'm new to Osaka. Can you show me around here?<p class="message sent">Hi John, I'm happy to guide you. My name is Mika. So, where would you like to go first?<p class=message>I heard that Dotonbori is a must-visit place. There are so many people here. Is this a popular spot?<p class="message sent">Yes, Dotonbori is very popular, especially at night. It's a hub for entertainment, shopping and food. You should try Osaka's famous Takoyaki here!<p class=message>Really? What's Takoyaki?<p class="message sent">Takoyaki is a popular Japanese snack made from batter, octopus, green onion and spices.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. What else should I try here that I cannot find anywhere else?<p class="message sent">You cannot miss Okonomiyaki, which is similar to a savory pancake. You can also try Pufferfish, a Japanese delicacy.<p class=message>That's fascinating! What can you tell me about the local culture and customs?<p class="message sent">In Osaka, people are known for being friendly and humorous. We also have lots of festivals throughout the year. One of which is the Osaka Tenjin Matsuri, one of the three big festivals in Japan.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a grand celebration! How about the language? Do you have any tips for me to get by?<p class="message sent">Most locals don't speak much English, but don't worry too much. You can use simple English, Sign language or download a translation app. Just don't be afraid to say "sumimasen" (excuse me) and "arigato" (thank you).<p class=message>Thanks for your help, Mika. This has been a fun and enlightening experience.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, John. Have a great time in Osaka and enjoy the rest of your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8642c69c-fb28-4fcb-80f5-e03f6279f93b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
