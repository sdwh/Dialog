Thanks for talking with me today. How are you doing?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks for asking. And you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. So, can you tell me a little bit about your job?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. I'm a professional cake decorator. I make custom cakes for birthdays, weddings, and other special events.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. How did you get into cake decorating?<p class="message sent">Well, I've always had a passion for baking, and one day I decided to try my hand at decorating. I fell in love with it and never looked back.<p class=message>I can imagine. What's the most elaborate cake you've ever made?<p class="message sent">That would have to be a seven-tiered wedding cake that I made for a couple last year. It took me nearly 30 hours to decorate, but it was a huge hit.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. Do you have any tips for people who are interested in learning how to decorate cakes?<p class="message sent">Definitely. First and foremost, practice makes perfect. And don't be afraid to experiment with different techniques and flavors. And, of course, have fun with it!<p class=message>That's great advice. Thanks so much for talking with me today, B. It was really nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A.
