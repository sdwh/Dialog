Sounds pretty intense.<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, but it's important for companies to understand the potential impacts on their business.<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely. Have you done one before?<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, it was a bit of a headache, but it really helped us prepare for any potential disasters.<p class="message sent message-content">What kind of disasters did you consider?<p class="message received message-content">Everything from natural disasters to cyber attacks. We even looked at the impact of losing key staff members.<p class="message sent message-content">Wow, that's really thorough.<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, it's important to think of all possible scenarios. Have you started your BIA yet?<p class="message sent message-content">Not yet, but I'm planning to soon.<p class="message received message-content">Good idea. It can seem overwhelming at first, but it's worth it in the long run.<p class="message sent message-content">I'm just worried about getting all the stakeholders on board.<p class="message received message-content">That can definitely be a challenge, but try to focus on the benefits and the potential consequences of not doing it.<p class="message sent message-content">That's true. Thanks for the advice!<p class="message received message-content">No problem. Let me know if you need any help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=03851c39-5142-42f5-9df7-5d0cba122fb1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
