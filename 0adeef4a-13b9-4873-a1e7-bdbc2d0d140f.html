Ultimate. What about you?<p class=message>Nice! I also have Mario Kart but I also have Animal Crossing and Pokemon Sword.<p class="message sent">I've heard great things about Animal Crossing. How do you like it?<p class=message>I love it! It's such a relaxing game and I love designing my own island. Have you tried it?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but maybe I should give it a try. How about Pokemon Sword? Are you enjoying it?<p class=message>Definitely! I'm a huge Pokemon fan so I was really excited for this game. The new Pokemon designs are really cool.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. I've been playing a lot of Smash Bros. lately. Who's your favorite character to play as?<p class=message>Probably Kirby. He's just so adorable and his special moves are pretty powerful. What about you?<p class="message sent">I like playing as Donkey Kong. His punches and ground slams are really strong.<p class=message>Yeah, Donkey Kong is definitely a powerhouse. Have you played any other games on the Switch?<p class="message sent">I've played a bit of Splatoon 2 and it's a lot of fun. It's like a combination of a shooter and a platformer.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard good things about that game. Maybe I'll have to check it out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0ad82186-a39b-45c8-9bb6-5c5dd4f35420.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
