How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm feeling great! The weather is perfect for sightseeing.<p class=message>Yes, it is. Let's start our tour by visiting the famous Glastonbury Tor.<p class="message sent">Sounds exciting! What can you tell me about it?<p class=message>Legend has it that King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table visited this site. And some say it's where the Holy Grail is hidden.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's fascinating! How did you become a guide?<p class=message>I've always been interested in history and mythology. And I love showing visitors the beauty of the Avalon Peninsula.<p class="message sent">I can tell. You're so passionate about it. What's your favorite place to take tourists?<p class=message>That's a tough question! But I would have to say the Chalice Well Gardens. It's a peaceful oasis with healing waters and stunning gardens.<p class="message sent">That sounds lovely. I can't wait to see it. Is there anything else I should know about the area?<p class=message>One thing you should know is that the town of Glastonbury is home to some of the best bread in England. You'll have to try the local bakeries!<p class="message sent">I definitely will. I love trying new foods when I travel.<p class=message>Me too! And speaking of food, have you tried fish and chips yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It was absolutely delicious.<p class=message>Great to hear. And if you're feeling adventurous, you should try some haggis when we get to Scotland.<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe I'll pass on that one.<p class=message>Fair enough! How about we make our way to Stonehenge after lunch? It's a must-see when visiting England.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. Let's head there next!<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. And don't forget to take some photos for your scrapbook back home.<p class="message sent">Of course not! Thanks for showing me around today, A. It's been a great tour so far.<p class=message>You're very welcome, B. It's been a pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7b0a2844-fcea-445e-a1c4-43cb806b4f71.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
