Can you help me with that?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'd be happy to. Do you have your maintenance records handy?<p class=message>Yes, I do. Let me just grab them from my glove compartment.<p class="message sent">Great, take your time. So, have you been driving a lot lately?<p class=message>Not really, I've mostly just been using my car to run errands.<p class="message sent">Well, that's good news for your car's mileage. Let's see... it looks like you've only put around 1,000 miles on it since your last maintenance check.<p class=message>Wow, that's a lot less than I thought. I guess I've been better about walking or biking when I can.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! Not only is it better for the environment, but it's also better for your overall health.<p class=message>Absolutely. Plus, it gives me a chance to get some fresh air and enjoy the scenery.<p class="message sent">That's a good attitude to have. And it certainly shows in your car's low mileage. Is there anything else I can help you with today?<p class=message>Not at the moment, but thank you so much for your help. You've been very informative and pleasant to speak with.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any future questions or concerns. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dad20cab-c633-47bf-9383-89cbc4f22e6f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
