How's everything going?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! Everything's good. Just working on some upcoming gigs.<p class=message>Oh yeah, speaking of gigs, have you heard about that new artist J?<p class="message sent">J? Oh, you mean the one who just got signed? Yeah, I heard about him.<p class=message>Yeah, that's the one! I was thinking we could possibly collaborate with him for a show.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's not a bad idea. What did you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking a mix of his new stuff and some of my old classics.<p class="message sent">I like where you're going with that. What about venues?<p class=message>I was thinking maybe a local club or bar - keep it intimate.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll start scouting out some places. And we'll need to figure out J's availability.<p class=message>Sounds good. And maybe we could even throw in a surprise guest appearance?<p class="message sent">Ooh, I like the way you think. Let's make it happen!<p class=message>Awesome, can't wait to see it all come together.<p class="message sent">Me too. But for now, back to the grind.<p class=message>Yep, let's get back to work. Talk to you soon!<p class="message sent">Definitely. Take care, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5f0d81d3-bd82-49b4-843a-1978d13f03f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
