Really excited to be learning how to make authentic Spanish chocolate today!<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm B, your guide for today. You'll be visiting one of the best chocolate factories in Barcelona where you'll learn everything you need to know about making chocolate.<p class=message>Sounds great! What's the first thing we'll be doing?<p class="message sent">Well, the first thing is to roast the cocoa beans. This is a crucial step that brings out the full flavor of the chocolate.<p class=message>That makes sense! How long do we roast them for?<p class="message sent">It depends on the size of the beans and the type of chocolate you're making. But, generally, it takes about 30-45 minutes.<p class=message>Wow, I had no idea it took that long! What's next in the process?<p class="message sent">After roasting, we'll grind the beans until they turn into a fine paste, this paste is what we call cocoa liquor.<p class=message>I see, and what's after that?<p class="message sent">The cocoa butter is separated from the cocoa liquor, and then sugar and milk are added in the right proportions to make delicious chocolate.<p class=message>Amazing! Can I have a try at making chocolate now?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's head over to the workshop, where you can put what you've learned into practice.<p class=message>Great! Can't wait to get my hands messy with chocolate. It's going to be an exciting day!<p class="message sent">Yep, you're going to have a lot of fun. And don't worry, I'll be here to guide you every step of the way.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I feel much more confident with your guidance. Let's go make some delicious chocolate!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d5f5312f-479b-4562-b071-b5503afee2d0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
