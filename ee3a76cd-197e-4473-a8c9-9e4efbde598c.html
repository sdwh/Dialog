I'm looking for a new dress for a wedding next week. Can you help me find something fabulous?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Have you got any particular styles or colors in mind?<p class=message>Hmm, I was thinking something floral and bright, but not too dressy.<p class="message sent">Great, we have a new summer collection that might just fit the bill. Let's have a look.<p class=message>Ooh, I love this one! It's so flowy and the print is gorgeous.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a popular choice. It's also available in a few different colors. Would you like to try it on?<p class=message>Yes, please! And I'm thinking of pairing it up with some strappy sandals.<p class="message sent">Good choice. We have some really cute ones over here that might just catch your eye.<p class=message>Oh, these are perfect! I love the little bow detail.<p class="message sent">They're adorable, right? And they'll be great for the dance floor as well.<p class=message>You're right, I don't want to be stuck in high heels all night. Thanks for your help, by the way. You really know your stuff!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It's always fun helping people find the perfect outfit. And I have to say, that dress looks stunning on you.<p class=message>Thank you so much! I can't wait to wear it next week.<p class="message sent">You're welcome. And if you need any more help in the future, you know where to find us.<p class=message>Definitely! I'll be back for sure. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You too! Take care and enjoy the wedding.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ee36a1ca-7ebc-41a4-8a59-817021f10160.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
