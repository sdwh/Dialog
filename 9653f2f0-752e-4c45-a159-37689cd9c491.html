Can I help you with something?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Actually, I'm looking for some advice on selling our new travel packages to the customers here at the airport.<p class=message>Sure thing! What kind of travel packages do you offer?<p class="message sent">We have quite a few options, from adventure tours to luxury getaways. Our most popular package is a guided tour of Europe.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! Have you considered setting up a display or kiosk showcasing your packages? That way, customers can see firsthand what you have to offer.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Do you have any suggestions on how we can make our display stand out?<p class=message>Well, you could add some colorful banners or posters showcasing the different destinations, or even have a flat screen TV playing a promotional video.<p class="message sent">Those are all great ideas! We're also thinking of offering some limited time discounts to entice customers.<p class=message>That's a smart move! People love saving money, especially when it comes to travel.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's definitely what we're aiming for. Do you have any suggestions on how to approach customers and engage them in conversation?<p class=message>Well, a friendly smile and a warm greeting can go a long way. You could also ask them about their travel plans or where they're headed, and then try to tailor your pitch to their interests.<p class="message sent">Awesome! Thanks so much for your help. I think we have a solid plan now.<p class=message>Not a problem at all. Good luck with your sales and hope to see you back here soon!<p class="message sent">Thanks! Fingers crossed it goes well. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=96519c5f-4c40-49ec-9f57-8c3e674e8fe8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
