How's the development coming along?<p class="message sent">Hey A, it's going pretty well. I think we're making good progress with Node.js.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What's been the biggest challenge so far?<p class="message sent">I think the biggest challenge has been figuring out how to integrate different modules together. There are just so many options and configurations.<p class=message>Yeah, I know what you mean. It can get pretty overwhelming.<p class="message sent">But we're getting there. And it's nice to work with a language that's so versatile.<p class=message>Definitely. So, do you have any favorite Node.js libraries or packages that you've been working with?<p class="message sent">Hmm, there are a few. I really like working with Express and Socket.io. And I've been playing around with Puppeteer too.<p class=message>Nice, those are some great options. Have you had any funny experiences during this project?<p class="message sent">Haha, actually yeah. I accidentally left a console.log statement in the code and forgot to remove it before pushing to production. It ended up printing some embarrassing messages to users.<p class=message>Oh no, that's always a bit of a nightmare! But it's also a good reminder to always double-check our code.<p class="message sent">For sure. But overall, I've been really enjoying this project. It's great to work on something that's challenging but also really rewarding.<p class=message>I agree. It's always satisfying to see our hard work come to fruition in the end.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2eb7171f-3b79-4224-8be5-545f0c76b616.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
