I heard we have a meeting about improving the company's network security.<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing well. Yeah, that's right. So, where do we start?<p class=message>I suppose we could start with the basics. Has everyone updated their passwords recently?<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Maybe we can implement two-factor authentication as well.<p class=message>Definitely a good idea. How about we also look into using a virtual private network (VPN) for employees who work remotely?<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. That could be a great solution. Another thing we could do is conduct regular security training sessions for employees.<p class=message>Yes, spreading awareness is important. Speaking of awareness, do we have a protocol for dealing with phishing attempts?<p class="message sent">We do, but we can definitely review and improve it. Also, let's not forget about the importance of keeping software and systems up to date.<p class=message>Right, patching known vulnerabilities is crucial. I think we've come up with some solid suggestions.<p class="message sent">Indeed. Now, let's prioritize and create a plan of action. And, of course, celebrate our efforts with some pizza!<p class=message>Sounds like a plan to me, B! We'll get the network security tightened up and enjoy some delicious pizza.<p class="message sent">You got it, A. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f8aa44a0-af8a-43d7-b676-b46799ee53ea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
