My name is A and I'm the quality control specialist here. How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hi A! I'm B, a kimchi maker. I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great. So, how's the production going? Can you walk me through the process of making kimchi?<p class="message sent">Sure! First, the Napa cabbage is soaked in salt water to remove excess water. Then, we mix the spices and seasonings together—garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, fish sauce, sugar— to make the sauce. The cabbage is then coated with this sauce and stored in jars for fermentation.<p class=message>Wow, that's fascinating. I'm impressed by the amount of detail that goes into making kimchi! How do you know when it's ready?<p class="message sent">We taste it every day for a week until it reaches the desired level of sourness and spiciness.<p class=message>That's interesting. Have you ever encountered any challenges during the production process?<p class="message sent">One time, a batch of cabbage was too old and didn't ferment properly. It's important to use fresh ingredients and monitor the fermentation process closely.<p class=message>That makes sense. Well, I'm glad to see that everything is running smoothly today. Do you have any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Not really, just planning to rest and maybe catch up on some shows. How about you?<p class=message>Same here, just planning to relax and maybe go for a hike if the weather permits.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. Alright, I better get back to work. Thanks for dropping by, A!<p class=message>No problem, it was great talking with you. Good luck with the kimchi production!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=24cd5dac-41cc-4268-bafa-4928db03fe40.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
