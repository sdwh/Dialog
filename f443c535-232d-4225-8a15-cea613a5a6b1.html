Is it really that good?<p class=message>Oh, definitely. It's one of our bestsellers. The octopus is incredibly fresh and tender.<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing. I'll have to give it a try.<p class=message>Let me know what you think. And while you're at it, don't forget to recommend it to our customers.<p class="message sent">Will do. By the way, is it true that you can tell how fresh the seafood is just by looking at its eyes?<p class=message>Yes, it's a traditional way of testing the quality. If the eyes are clear and bright, it's a sign that the seafood is fresh.<p class="message sent">I had no idea. That's really interesting.<p class=message>It's all part of the job. We take pride in serving only the freshest seafood to our customers.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, these customers seem to be enjoying their meals. Do you think they'll leave us a good review?<p class=message>I hope so. Reviews can make a huge difference in attracting new customers.<p class="message sent">That's true. Well, I'll make sure they're happy and satisfied with their dining experience.<p class=message>Thanks, B. You're doing a great job. Keep up the good work.<p class="message sent">Will do, boss. And maybe later, you can teach me how to make that octopus dish.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f4425ed1-fa19-43f4-ae19-4c9ca4034e0a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
