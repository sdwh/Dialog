How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey there A! It's going great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>Fine, fine. I was just reading about ISO 27001 Security Objectives. Do you know anything about it?<p class="message sent">Ah, I'm familiar with it. It's a standard for information security management systems, right?<p class=message>Yes, that's the one. Have you ever implemented it in your company?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but it's in the works. It's definitely a priority for us.<p class=message>That's great. What do you think are some of the main security objectives of ISO 27001?<p class="message sent">Well, there are several, but I think the main one is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.<p class=message>That's right. And it also helps businesses to manage risks related to information security, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, it does. It provides a framework for identifying and managing security risks.<p class=message>I think that's really important, especially in today's digital age. So what are your thoughts on implementing it?<p class="message sent">I think it's necessary, but it can be a bit of a challenge. It requires a lot of planning and resources.<p class=message>Definitely. But it's worth it in the long run, don't you think?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It shows that we take information security seriously and can give our clients peace of mind.<p class=message>That's true. And it also helps us to stay compliant with laws and regulations related to information security.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's another important benefit. It can help us avoid costly fines and legal troubles.<p class=message>So, have you ever heard any funny stories related to ISO 27001?<p class="message sent">Hmm, not really. It's not the most exciting topic, is it?<p class=message>Yeah, true. But hey, we can still try to make it fun, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's all about perspective. But for now, let's get back to work and make sure our information is secured!<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Thanks for talking with me, B!<p class="message sent">Anytime, A! Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=145c9404-f75a-42b7-bfd0-7d8e332caa99.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
