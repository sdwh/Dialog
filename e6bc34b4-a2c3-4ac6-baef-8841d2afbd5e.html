Can I get a fresh one?<p class="message sent">Of course, sir! I'm so sorry about that. We'll have a new one brought out right away.<p class=message>Thank you, I appreciate it. I was really looking forward to trying your bread.<p class="message sent">I completely understand. Our bread is usually a customer favorite, and we want everyone to have the best experience possible. Is there anything else I can get for you?<p class=message>No, that's all for now. But may I ask, do you have any recommendations for the main course?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Our most popular dish is the grilled salmon with green beans and roasted potatoes. It's a personal favorite of mine as well.<p class=message>Hmm, that sounds really good. I think I'll go with that. And could I also get a glass of the house white wine?<p class="message sent">Excellent choice! I'll get that started for you right away. Is there anything else I can get for you, sir?<p class=message>No, that's it for now. Thank you for taking care of the burnt bread situation so quickly!<p class="message sent">No problem at all, sir. Our goal is always to make sure every customer enjoys their meal. I hope you have a great experience here!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e6b6d43a-6fd1-4e1b-8953-6749ca37394e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
