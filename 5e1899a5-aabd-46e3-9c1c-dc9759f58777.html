By the way, do you have any favorite stores in this mall?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love the bookstore on the second floor. I could spend hours in there.<p class=message>That's fantastic. I'm a big fan of that bookstore too. In fact, I often take my break in there just to read a book or two.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's great. It's definitely a peaceful spot in the midst of all the shopping chaos.<p class=message>Absolutely. Well, ma'am, it was nice speaking with you.
