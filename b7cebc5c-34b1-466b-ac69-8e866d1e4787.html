Who hasn’t? They are delicious!<p class=message>I can’t believe I’ve been missing out on this for so long.<p class="message sent">Oh, you have to try them. Where did you get them?<p class=message>I got them from a street vendor. They looked so good that I couldn’t resist.<p class="message sent">Oh, the best churros are the ones that are sold on the streets! What did you eat them with?<p class=message>I dipped them in chocolate sauce. It was heaven in my mouth. What about you?<p class="message sent">I like mine plain. Although sometimes, I’ll spread some caramel on them for added sweetness.<p class=message>I’m surprised that I’ve never seen these served in restaurants.<p class="message sent">Really? I’ve seen them in some Mexican restaurants. How crunchy were they?<p class=message>They were crunchy on the outside but soft and warm on the inside. I could eat them forever.<p class="message sent">Well, I wouldn’t recommend eating them all the time, but it’s okay to indulge every once in a while.<p class=message>Definitely. Who knew that fried dough could taste so good?<p class="message sent">It’s not just fried dough! It’s the cinnamon and sugar that makes them so irresistible.<p class=message>I’m totally craving some now. Let’s go find a street vendor.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Let’s go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b7cbfdfe-a4aa-408e-8238-c04c569ad233.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
