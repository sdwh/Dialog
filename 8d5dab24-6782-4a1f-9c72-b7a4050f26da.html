The meat just fell off the bone.<p class=message>I love a good barbecue sauce. Did it have a spicy kick to it?<p class="message sent">It definitely had a kick, but it wasn't overpowering. It was just the right amount of spicy.<p class=message>Were they served with any sides?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, they had the classic coleslaw and baked beans. Both were delicious.<p class=message>I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.<p class="message sent">Me too. We should go back and have it again soon.<p class=message>Do you think we could try making it ourselves at home?<p class="message sent">I don't see why not. Do you have a grill?<p class=message>Yeah, but I've never cooked ribs before. Do you have any tips?<p class="message sent">Make sure to marinate the meat for a few hours before grilling. And cook them low and slow for the best results.<p class=message>Low and slow, got it. I'm excited to give it a try.<p class="message sent">You should also try experimenting with different barbecue sauces. You never know what delicious combinations you might come up with.<p class=message>That's a great idea. Maybe I'll even start my own barbecue sauce business!<p class="message sent">Hey, you never know. You could be the next barbecue sauce mogul.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8d58c141-7cd0-4808-8ef1-79e268566a6c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
