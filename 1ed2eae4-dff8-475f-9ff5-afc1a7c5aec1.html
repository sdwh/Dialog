I'm doing pretty good, just trying to stay alert for the drive.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. So, have you ever been to Wuhan before?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have not. But I'm looking forward to exploring the city and trying out some new food.<p class=message>Oh yeah, Wuhan is famous for its local delicacies. Have you heard of hot and dry noodles?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! I hear it's a must-try dish. Do you have any recommendations for other local cuisine?<p class=message>Definitely try out the spicy fish hotpot and Wuhan-style jiāmó. They're delicious!<p class="message sent">Sounds fantastic! I'll have to make a stop at a restaurant and give those dishes a try.<p class=message>Have you been a taxi driver for long?<p class="message sent">I have been driving a taxi for about 5 years now. It's a good job that allows me to meet new people and see new places.<p class=message>That's great. Do you have any favorite music to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">I like to listen to classic rock, especially the Rolling Stones. How about you?<p class=message>I enjoy listening to jazz music. It helps me to relax after a busy day.<p class="message sent">I can see why that would be enjoyable. What brings you to Wuhan?<p class=message>I'm on a business trip, attending a conference. How about you?<p class="message sent">Just driving to Wuhan for a quick family vacation. We plan to visit some of the famous tourist spots and enjoy some much-needed relaxation.<p class=message>That sounds really nice. Have you been on any family trips before?<p class="message sent">Yes, we've been to the beach and mountains before. But we've never visited Wuhan, so we figured it would be a great new adventure for us.<p class=message>That makes sense. Well, I hope you have a wonderful time with your family during your vacation.<p class="message sent">Thank you! I hope you have a successful and productive trip at the conference. We're almost there!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1ed2815e-2bac-4909-af45-300e70ba3aac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
