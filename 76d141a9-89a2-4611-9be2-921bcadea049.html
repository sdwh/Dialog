As a network engineer, you should know better than to have weak passwords, outdated firewalls and routers.<p class=message>Oh man, you're right. I feel like such a poor network engineer. But, what about the hackers who try to bypass our firewall?<p class="message sent">Well, that's where we the security engineers come in. We'll make sure to have intrusion detection and prevention systems and continuously upgrade our security protocols.<p class=message>Sounds like you're the real MVP here, B.<p class="message sent">Haha, guilty as charged. But, you network engineers make our job a lot easier by keeping the network in tip-top shape.<p class=message>I hear you. It's all about teamwork. Speaking of which, have you seen the latest episode of our favorite show?<p class="message sent">Of course! Did you see the epic battle sequence?<p class=message>Yes, it was insane! But, did you catch the Easter egg referencing the very first episode?<p class="message sent">I totally did! I can't believe they brought that back, it's been ages.<p class=message>Right? I love how they connect everything in the series. It's like a giant puzzle, and we get to piece it together.<p class="message sent">Exactly! And, speaking of puzzles, let's get back to protecting the network. We've got more work to do.<p class=message>You're right. Let's get to it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=76d0341f-d677-4f9e-8c74-15e6db5d8326.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
