It's quite complex, isn't it?<p class=message>Definitely. But, we have to make sure we implement and monitor it properly to ensure data security.<p class="message sent">Agreed. How do you suggest we do that?<p class=message>Well, for starters, we can provide proper training and resources to all employees to ensure they understand it fully.<p class="message sent">And we can perform regular audits to make sure everything is in compliance.<p class=message>That's right. We must also review and update the policy from time to time to ensure it's up-to-date.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We don't want any data breaches due to outdated policy.<p class=message>Plus, we can assign a dedicated team to oversee its enforcement.<p class="message sent">Good idea. Let's also make sure that we have proper communication channels between departments to ensure everyone is on the same page.<p class=message>Yes, and we can even incentivize employees to adhere to the policy and report suspicious activity.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. But, what about new hires? How will they be trained on this policy?<p class=message>Good point. We can make sure to include it in their onboarding process and have senior staff mentor them.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. With everyone working together, we can ensure that our ISO 27001 policy is implemented and monitored effectively.<p class=message>Exactly. Our company's data security is paramount, and we must take all necessary steps to protect it.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's get to work and make sure we are all in compliance!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4223d17c-367a-46b5-9e9d-513e7febadee.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
