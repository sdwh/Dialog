I'm excited to see Marseille, how long have you been a taxi driver here?<p class="message sent">Hi, welcome to Marseille! I've been driving taxis for about 10 years now. Have you been here before?<p class=message>No, it's my first time. Do you have any recommendations for places to visit or eat?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out the Old Port, it has a great view of the Mediterranean. For food, I recommend trying bouillabaisse, a local fish soup.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! Is Marseille known for any other special dishes?<p class="message sent">Yes, we also have pastis, a anise-flavored aperitif. It's a popular drink here.<p class=message>I'll have to try that too! Do you have any funny stories from being a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I once had a couple who forgot their baby in the backseat! They were so embarrassed when they realized.<p class=message>That's crazy! I hope they remembered to take the baby with them after that. Do you enjoy being a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. I like meeting new people and hearing their stories. What about you, what do you do?<p class=message>I work in marketing. It can be stressful at times, but I enjoy the creativity involved.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Do you get to travel often for work?<p class=message>Yes, I do. In fact, I'll be going to Paris next week for a conference.<p class="message sent">Nice! I hope you have a good time there. We're almost at your destination, enjoy your time in Marseille!<p class=message>Thank you! You've been a great driver and guide. Have a good day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=645a144a-ee17-4478-bca2-0fc4e0d9647c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
