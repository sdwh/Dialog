Can you take me to the airport, please?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Yes, of course. Which airport are we headed to?<p class=message>We're going to Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, how long do you think it will take us to get there?<p class="message sent">Well, it depends on the traffic but it should take us about an hour or so. Have you been to Delhi before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time. I'm excited to explore the city.<p class="message sent">That's great! I have been driving in Delhi for over 10 years, so if you need any recommendations or advice, just let me know.<p class=message>Thank you! I actually heard there are some amazing street food vendors in Delhi. Have you tried any of them?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, the street food here is delicious! My personal favorite is the chole bhature, it's a spicy chickpea curry served with fried bread.<p class=message>That sounds amazing, I'll have to try it. What do you think is the best time to visit Delhi?<p class="message sent">Well, the weather can be quite extreme, so I would recommend visiting in the winter months from November to February when it's a bit cooler.<p class=message>That's good to know, I'll keep that in mind. By the way, what do you think of the music scene in Delhi?<p class="message sent">Oh, there's a great live music scene in the city. One of the most popular venues is 'The Piano Man' in Safdarjung Enclave. They have live music every night.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a great place to check out. Thank you for the tip! And we have reached the airport. How much do I owe you?<p class="message sent">The fare comes to 500 Rupees. Have a safe trip and enjoy your time in Delhi!<p class=message>Thank you, I will! Have a good day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d9f620c4-0b97-4694-99a5-fbefdc0f1148.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
