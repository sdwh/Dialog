It’s great to be here in your new restaurant.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A! We're glad you could join us for our new menu tasting.<p class=message>I'm excited to try out the new dishes. What would you recommend?<p class="message sent">Well, we have our signature dish, the braised pork belly with honey glaze, and also our new dish, the grilled octopus with chorizo.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. Let’s start with the braised pork belly, please.<p class="message sent">Great choice, A. This dish took a lot of time and effort to perfect - I’m eager to hear your thoughts on it.<p class=message>Mmm, the pork belly is perfectly tender, and the sweetness from the honey glaze balances out the saltiness of the meat.<p class="message sent">That's what we were aiming for! What about the grilled octopus?<p class=message>The octopus is cooked just right, not too tough, and the chorizo adds a nice smoky flavor to the dish.<p class="message sent">We're really happy to hear that! Any suggestions on how we can improve it?<p class=message>Maybe a bit more seasoning on the octopus? But overall, it's great!<p class="message sent">Thank you for the helpful feedback, A. Now, let's try our vegetarian curry.<p class=message>Oh, this is delicious! The curry is flavorful and the vegetables are perfectly cooked.<p class="message sent">We're glad you like it, A! It's a dish we're really proud of.<p class=message>I can see why. The flavors are really well-balanced. What’s next?<p class="message sent">Next up is our grilled steak with chimichurri sauce.<p class=message>Wow, the steak is perfectly cooked! And the chimichurri sauce is a great addition.<p class="message sent">We spent a lot of time perfecting the cooking temperature - it's great to hear it paid off!<p class=message>Definitely! This steak is melt-in-your-mouth.<p class="message sent">That's what we want our guests to experience. Thanks for your insightful feedback, A. We appreciate it a lot!<p class=message>No problem, B! I'm always happy to be a taste tester.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=14810246-8b0c-4de6-bf77-42a40e886d23.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
