Would you like cream and sugar with your coffee?<p class=message>Just cream, please. I'm trying to cut back on my sugar intake.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Have you tried any sugar substitutes?<p class=message>Yeah, I usually use Splenda or Stevia if I need to sweeten something up.<p class="message sent">Good to know. And for your water, would you prefer bottled or tap?<p class=message>Tap is fine, thank you. I'm trying to be environmentally conscious and reduce my plastic waste.<p class="message sent">That's admirable. We always offer both options to accommodate our passengers' preferences.<p class=message>Appreciate it. Hey, I noticed that your name tag says you're from Dallas. What do you recommend doing there?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm a big fan of the State Fair of Texas. It's held every fall and has everything from live music to fried food competitions.<p class=message>Fried food competitions? You had me at hello.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yes, they're a must-see. But if you're looking for more upscale entertainment, the Dallas Museum of Art is really impressive.<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestions. I might have to plan a trip there soon.<p class="message sent">It's definitely worth it. And speaking of trips, are you headed anywhere specific on this flight?<p class=message>Just going back home after a work trip. But I'm looking forward to getting some rest on the plane.<p class="message sent">I hear you. If you need anything else to help you relax, just let me know.<p class=message>Will do. Thanks for your help, and for being so friendly.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Enjoy your beverages, and have a safe rest of your flight.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b041713a-9139-4dcb-8a01-c2b1a8d99e20.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
