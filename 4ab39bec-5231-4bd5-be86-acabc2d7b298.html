It's all about being prepared for emergencies so that we can avoid major disruptions in our work.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. How does it work exactly?<p class=message>Well, it's basically a plan that outlines the steps we need to take in case of a crisis, like a power outage or a cyber attack.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So, do we already have a plan in place?<p class=message>Yup, we do! But we need to update it regularly and make sure it's effective in helping us handle any situation that comes up.<p class="message sent">Gotcha. One question though...how do we know if it's working?<p class=message>We should do a test run every now and then to make sure everything runs smoothly. It's better to be safe than sorry, right?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Have we ever had to use the plan before?<p class=message>Not yet, but it's good to know we have it in case we need it.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's important to be prepared, especially in the age of technology and cyber threats.<p class=message>Absolutely! That's why it's also important to invest in a good cybersecurity system to protect our data.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I heard there are different levels of certification for cybersecurity, have you heard of them?<p class=message>Yes, I have. One of the most recognized ones is the CISSP certification.<p class="message sent">Interesting, what does that stand for?<p class=message>It stands for Certified Information Systems Security Professional, and it's a globally recognized certification in the field of cybersecurity.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds impressive. Maybe I should consider getting certified too.<p class=message>You definitely should! The more we know about cybersecurity, the better we can protect ourselves and our work.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tip, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. Safety first, right?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4ab33b36-9aca-4f02-a7b6-1613d26b7e88.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
