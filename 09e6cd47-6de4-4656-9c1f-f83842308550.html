Let's start the stand-up meeting. B, would you like to kick us off?<p class="message sent">Sure! Yesterday, I was working on optimizing the search function in our app. It's now lightning fast!<p class=message>Awesome! That's great progress. I spent some time refining the user interface to make it more intuitive. I think it looks much better now.<p class="message sent">I agree. Speaking of the UI, I noticed a minor bug in the notification pop-up. I fixed it and pushed the code to the repository.<p class=message>Great catch! Thanks for taking care of that. I was also thinking we could add a new feature to the app - a dark mode. It's something users have been requesting for a while.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. It shouldn't be too hard to implement either. I'll look into it today.<p class=message>Perfect. And just a reminder, our deadline is in two weeks. Let's make sure we stay focused and keep up the good work.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And on a lighter note, I stumbled upon a funny meme about programming this morning. It made my day!<p class=message>Haha, I love a good programming joke. Do you mind sharing it with us?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. What do you call a programmer who can't solve a problem? A debugger.<p class=message>That's great. I think we can all relate to that. Thanks for starting our day with a laugh, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=09e451ea-990d-48d8-bdda-8041cca38571.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
