Welcome to our design studio! How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm looking to design a unique logo for my new business. Can you help me with that?<p class=message>Of course! That's exactly what we do. What kind of business is it?<p class="message sent">It's a boutique coffee shop. I want something fun and playful, but also professional.<p class=message>Great! We can definitely work with that. Did you have any specific colors in mind?<p class="message sent">I was thinking something with browns and greens - like coffee and nature.<p class=message>I love that idea! How about we incorporate a coffee cup design with some leaves and branches around it?<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! Can we also add something that represents the town we're located in?<p class=message>Absolutely! We can incorporate the town's landmark in the background or even use the town's name as part of the logo.<p class="message sent">I love it! How long do you think it will take to design the logo?<p class=message>It usually takes us about a week to come up with a few options for you to choose from. Once you make a decision, we can fine-tune it to your liking.<p class="message sent">That works for me. And what's the pricing like?<p class=message>For a custom logo design, our prices start at $500. However, we can customize a package to fit your specific needs.<p class="message sent">That's fair. I trust your expertise and can't wait to see what you come up with.<p class=message>Thank you for your trust! We're excited to help bring your vision to life.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=58be5437-7acc-401e-9392-12b0e7dc98a8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
