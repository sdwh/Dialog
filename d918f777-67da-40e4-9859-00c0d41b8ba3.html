My name is Emma, and I'm your guide for today. Is everyone ready to explore this stunning UNESCO World Heritage site?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I've been looking forward to this visit for months, ever since I booked my trip to Sydney.<p class=message>That's great to hear, B. Let's start with some basic facts. Did you know that the building of the Opera House started in 1959 and ended in 1973?<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a long time! I had no idea.<p class=message>Yes, it was a complex engineering feat at the time, involving over 10,000 people. But it was definitely worth it as the Opera House has become a signature landmark of Sydney and Australia.<p class="message sent">No doubt about that! What's your favorite part of the Opera House?<p class=message>Personally, I love the Concert Hall. It's the biggest venue in the Opera House, with over 2,500 seats. It also has one of the largest mechanical tracker-action organs in the world.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds amazing. Can we see it up close?<p class=message>Unfortunately not today, but I highly suggest you come back and watch a performance. It's truly a magical experience.<p class="message sent">I definitely will! What other shows do you recommend?<p class=message>Well, it really depends on your preference. There's a wide range of performances that cater to different tastes, from ballet to theater to rock concerts. Just check out the schedule online.<p class="message sent">Got it. What else should we know about the Opera House?<p class=message>One fun fact is that the roof of the Opera House is made up of over 1 million tiles that were imported from Sweden.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. And what about the sails?<p class=message>Ah, the sails are actually made of fiberglass, not cloth. They're also self-cleaning, which is pretty impressive.<p class="message sent">Wow, you really know your stuff, Emma. Thank you for this tour!<p class=message>You're very welcome, B. I hope you enjoy the rest of your time in Sydney. Don't forget to take plenty of photos with the Opera House in the background.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d9131376-4724-4aab-ac3d-1accf55e996e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
