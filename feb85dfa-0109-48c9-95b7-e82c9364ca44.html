Are you ready for another day of transport and sales?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I sure am. What animals do we have to move today?<p class=message>We've got a whole bunch of chickens and a dozen pigs ready for sale. We need to load them up and take them to the market.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I'll go get my truck and we'll start loading them up.<p class=message>Great! While you're getting the truck, I'll go check on the animals and make sure they're all healthy and ready to go.<p class="message sent">Hey, A, did you hear about the new calf that was born yesterday? It's the cutest thing I've ever seen.<p class=message>No, I didn't hear about it. I'll have to go take a look. We might even consider holding onto it and raising it ourselves.<p class="message sent">I think that's a great idea. We could name it after you since you'll be taking care of it.<p class=message>(laughs) That would be funny. I hope it's a girl so we can call her Annabelle.<p class="message sent">Perfect! Annabelle it is.<p class=message>(checking the transport list) Alright, we've got everything loaded up and ready to go. Let's hit the road!<p class="message sent">(starting the truck) We'll be at the market in no time. Thanks for your help, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. It's always a pleasure working with you.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Likewise, my friend.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=feb4c3da-47da-4e6b-bdc9-96b60c430fb3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
