What's special about the dishes?<p class="message sent">Welcome! We're featuring freshly caught seafood and locally grown vegetables. We're also experimenting with unique spices and seasoning.<p class=message>Sounds promising! Let's start with the appetizers. This dish looks colorful, what's in it?<p class="message sent">That's our beetroot and goat cheese crostini. Would you like to give it a try?<p class=message>Mmm, it's delicious. The flavors really complement each other.<p class="message sent">Thank you for your feedback. How about this seafood platter?<p class=message>The scallops and prawns are cooked perfectly, but I think the sauce is overpowering.<p class="message sent">Noted, we'll adjust the seasoning for the next batch. Have you tasted the main course yet?<p class=message>Yes, I had the steak. It was juicy and tender, but the mashed potatoes were a bit bland.<p class="message sent">We'll add more herbs to the potatoes to elevate their taste. And for dessert, do you like chocolate?<p class=message>Who doesn't? This chocolate mousse cake is heavenly.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you enjoyed it. Is there anything else you'd like to sample or provide feedback on?<p class=message>Everything was great, but perhaps consider adding a vegetarian option to the menu for those who don't eat meat.<p class="message sent">Excellent suggestion! Thank you for your input, we'll definitely take it into account.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d0270634-beaf-4a4d-bd3b-fbcc8eb25afa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
