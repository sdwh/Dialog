Wasn't their son about the same age as ours?<p class=message>Yes, he was. I wonder if they're here too?<p class="message sent">That would be funny if we ended up sitting next to them.<p class=message>They were talking about trying out some new baby food recipes. Maybe we can get some tips from them.<p class="message sent">Yeah, our little one can be such a picky eater sometimes.<p class=message>I know what you mean. But hey, at least they're not throwing food on the floor like they used to.<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah that's true. Our son is getting better at using utensils too.<p class=message>Speaking of utensils, have you tried the new forks and knives they have here? They feel so fancy!<p class="message sent">Oh, I haven't noticed. Maybe I'll try to eat like a queen tonight then.<p class=message>Sounds good to me! Let's enjoy our meal and catch up on each other's day.<p class="message sent">Agreed.
