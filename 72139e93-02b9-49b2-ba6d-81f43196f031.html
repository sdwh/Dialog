Ready for some fun in the sun?<p class="message sent">Good morning coach! Absolutely! I've been looking forward to this all week!<p class=message>Great! So today we're going to focus on your serves and your spikes.<p class="message sent">That sounds good. I've been practicing my serves, but I'm not very confident with my spikes.<p class=message>No worries, we'll work on that today. Let's start with some warm-up exercises.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, coach. I don't want to pull any muscles.<p class=message>Alright, let's jog along the beach to get your heart rate up. Then we'll start some stretches.<p class="message sent">This is such a beautiful day to be outside. The sun is shining and there's a nice breeze.<p class=message>Yes, it's perfect beach weather. Okay, let's start with some arm stretches, raise your arms up and hold.<p class="message sent">Ah, I can feel the stretch in my shoulders. This feels good.<p class=message>(laughs) Good pain, right? Now let's work on your footwork. I'm going to toss the ball and I want you to shuffle your feet and catch it.<p class="message sent">Got it, coach. (runs towards the ball) Oops, missed it. Let me try that again.<p class=message>That's okay, it takes some practice. Nice hustle though. Let's try again.<p class="message sent">Alright, this time I've got it. (catches the ball) Yes!<p class=message>You're getting the hang of it. Now let's work on your serves. I want you to stand behind the end line and serve the ball over the net.<p class="message sent">Okay, let me give it a try. (tosses the ball up and serves) Oops, it went into the net.<p class=message>It's all good. Keep your eye on the ball and make sure you follow through with your arm swing.<p class="message sent">Okay, let me try again. (serves the ball over the net)<p class=message>Great job, B! Your serves are looking much better. Now let's move on to your spikes.<p class="message sent">(looks nervous) I don't know if I can do it, coach.<p class=message>Sure you can! Just remember to jump up and hit the ball with your full arm swing.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me try. (jumps and swings arm to spike the ball) Whoa! I did it!<p class=message>Yes, you did! That was awesome. Now let's keep working on your technique and you'll be a pro in no time.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, coach. This is so much fun.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Now let's finish up with some cool down exercises.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I'm pretty tired after all that jumping and running.<p class=message>(laughs) I bet you are. Let's stretch out those muscles one more time and then you're free to hit the beach and relax.<p class="message sent">Thanks again, coach. You're the best!<p class=message>(smiles) Anytime, B. Keep practicing and you'll be a pro in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=720f96dd-86e6-4ed5-aea1-25251ca07a01.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
