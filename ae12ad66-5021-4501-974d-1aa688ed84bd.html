How did you sleep last night?"<p class="message sent">"Morning A, I slept like a baby. How about you?"<p class=message>"I wish I could say the same, but I was up late editing some footage. Are you ready for today's shoot?"<p class="message sent">"Absolutely! Can't wait to get into character and bring your vision to life."<p class=message>"That's great to hear. By the way, did you see the caterer's menu? They have the best burgers in town."<p class="message sent">"Oh wow, I'm definitely getting one of those for lunch."<p class=message>"Don't worry, I made sure you have a break at noon to enjoy your burger."<p class="message sent">"You're the best A! So, what scene are we filming first?"<p class=message>"We're starting with the rooftop chase scene. I hope you brought your running shoes."<p class="message sent">"I did, though I hope I don't have to do too many takes. My cardio isn't what it used to be."<p class=message>"We'll see about that. But don't worry, we have an amazing stunt team to assist you."<p class="message sent">"That's a relief. I don't want to trip and fall off the building, and ruin the whole film!"<p class=message>"Haha, don't worry B. We're not making that kind of movie. It's just good old-fashioned action-adventure."<p class="message sent">"Awesome, that sounds like a lot of fun. Let's do this!"<p class=message>"Alright then, let's get you into your wardrobe and makeup. We have a lot to do today."<p class="message sent">"I'm ready when you are, A.
