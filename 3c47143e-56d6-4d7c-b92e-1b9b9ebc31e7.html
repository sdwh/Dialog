Welcome to the beautiful Sensoji Temple in Asakusa, Tokyo. My name is A and I'll be your tour bus driver today. I hope you all are enjoying your time in Japan.<p class="message sent">Hello, everyone! My name is B, and I'll be your guide for today. Sensoji Temple is one of the oldest temples in Japan, and it has a rich history and cultural significance.<p class=message>That's right, B. The temple was first built in the 7th century, and it has been destroyed and rebuilt several times. The current structure was built after World War II.<p class="message sent">The temple is dedicated to the Bodhisattva Kannon, who is the goddess of mercy. It is believed that she protects all living beings and helps them to achieve enlightenment.<p class=message>That's fascinating, B. I didn't know that. It's also interesting to note that the temple has a large red lantern, which is one of the most recognizable symbols of Asakusa.<p class="message sent">Yes, the lantern is called Kaminarimon, and it is the main gate to the temple. Inside the gate, there is a shopping street called Nakamise, where you can buy traditional Japanese souvenirs and snacks.<p class=message>Speaking of snacks, have any of you tried the famous senbei rice crackers? They are made fresh at the Sensoji Temple and are a must-try.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A! And if you're feeling adventurous, you can also try the local specialty, fukagawa-meshi, which is a type of seafood rice bowl.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! As we conclude our tour of Sensoji Temple, I hope you all have gained a deeper appreciation for this important cultural landmark. Thank you for joining us today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3c3f6166-69aa-4db9-ac75-faf00c96f211.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
