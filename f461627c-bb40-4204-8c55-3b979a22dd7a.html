How about you, how's your ISO 27001 audit coming along?<p class=message>It's been pretty smooth sailing so far, although I have to admit some of the technical stuff is a bit over my head.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I know what you mean. I always joke that it's a good thing I'm not the one writing the code, I'm just here to make sure it's secure.<p class=message>Haha, that's a good one. You know, speaking of code, have you seen that robot dance video that's been going viral?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Why, is it related to server management?<p class=message>Not at all, it's just a fun distraction from all this technical talk. Want me to pull it up on my phone?<p class="message sent">Sure, why not? I could use a laugh.<p class=message>That was hilarious! But back to business, have you noticed any potential vulnerabilities or threats to the server system during our audit?<p class="message sent">Actually, I did come across a few areas that could use some fortification. I'll send you the details in an email later today.<p class=message>Sounds good, thanks for keeping an eye out. Hey, do you have any recommendations for a good lunch spot around here?<p class="message sent">Definitely, there's a great sushi place just a few blocks away. Have you tried it yet?<p class=message>No, I haven't, but sushi sounds perfect. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class="message sent">No problem, enjoy your lunch. And let me know if you find any good dance videos while you're at it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f45ebcb1-32db-43d5-9644-44279cada2fc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
