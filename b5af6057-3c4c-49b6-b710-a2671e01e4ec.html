My throat has been bothering me for a few days now.<p class=message>Let me take a look. Ah, yes, it seems like you have a bad case of tonsillitis.<p class="message sent">Is it serious?<p class=message>Not too serious, but we need to give your immune system a little help. I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics for you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, doc. Do I need to take it with food?<p class=message>It's better if you take it on an empty stomach. But don't worry, we'll give you some crackers to munch on.<p class="message sent">Ha, thanks. I'll cross my fingers that this does the trick.<p class=message>Definitely, and in the meantime, try to rest and drink lots of fluids.<p class="message sent">Will do. Speaking of rest, what do you think of Canberra? Is it worth visiting?<p class=message>Oh, absolutely! It's sometimes known as Australia's best-kept secret. It has plenty of museums and galleries, plus it's home to some of the best restaurants in the country.<p class="message sent">Sounds like I can plan my next trip while I recuperate. Thanks for the tip, doc.<p class=message>That's what I'm here for. Who knows, maybe you'll find yourself feeling better and coming back to visit in no time.<p class="message sent">With health care this friendly, I'd definitely come back.<p class=message>That's what we like to hear. Don't hesitate to give us a call if you need anything else.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks again.<p class=message>Take care, get well soon, and enjoy your visit to Canberra.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b5aeff56-bb07-46d0-b4fd-72b0be5f0f96.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
