How's it going today?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thanks. How about yourself?<p class=message>Not bad, but I've got a question for you. We're looking into purchasing SQL Server license for our new project, and I'm not quite sure about the best option.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. What are you leaning towards so far?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking about getting the standard edition, but it seems like there are a lot of limitations with that option.<p class="message sent">That depends on what you're trying to accomplish. What features do you need?<p class=message>We're mainly going to be using it for data warehousing and analysis, so I think we might need some of the more advanced features.<p class="message sent">In that case, it might be worth considering the enterprise edition. It's pricier, but it includes a lot of additional functionality.<p class=message>Yeah, I was looking at that option too. Do you think it's worth the extra cost?<p class="message sent">It really depends on your specific needs. I'd recommend doing a cost-benefit analysis to determine which option makes the most sense for your project.<p class=message>That's a good point. Thanks for the input, B. Do you have any other tips?<p class="message sent">One thing to keep in mind is that there are also per-user and per-core licensing options that might be more cost-effective, depending on the number of users and processors you have.<p class=message>Ah, I see. That's something to consider as well. Thanks for your help, B. I really appreciate it.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. Let me know if you have any other questions!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4757ffcb-41d3-4261-b286-031e7cbf5b25.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
