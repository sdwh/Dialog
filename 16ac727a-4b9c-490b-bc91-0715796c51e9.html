Today, we're learning to make Thai-style red braised pork. Are you excited to learn, B?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A! I’ve always been curious about how to make this classic Thai dish.<p class=message>Great, let's start by marinating the pork in soy sauce, rice wine, and some aromatic spices for a few hours.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect! What other ingredients do we need for the red braised pork?<p class=message>We'll need some garlic, ginger, star anise, cinnamon, and brown sugar to create that rich and flavorful sauce.<p class="message sent">Yum! What about the sides?<p class=message>For the sides, we'll prepare some sticky rice, pickled vegetables, and a refreshing papaya salad.<p class="message sent">That all sounds so delicious. I can't wait to get started!<p class=message>Okay, first we need to simmer the marinated pork in the spices on low heat for a few hours until it's tender and juicy.<p class="message sent">Got it, that makes sense. And while the pork is cooking, we can prepare the sticky rice and papaya salad?<p class=message>Exactly! And we'll also need to make the pickled vegetables by soaking them in a vinegar and sugar mixture for a few hours.<p class="message sent">This is so much fun! I can’t wait to serve this yummy dish to our customers.<p class=message>It's important to make sure everything is prepared correctly and carefully, but at the same time, have fun and enjoy the process.<p class="message sent">Agreed, cooking should always be enjoyable.<p class=message>Great job, B! The pork looks and smells amazing. I think we have a new signature dish for our restaurant.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A! This was such a fun learning experience. I can't wait to make it for my family and friends.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=16a6c35c-9c27-4d72-8171-7b33457fc770.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
