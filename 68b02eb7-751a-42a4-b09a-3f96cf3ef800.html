What is it?<p class=message>It’s called the “lazy loading” pattern. It defers the loading of non-critical resources until they are needed, which speeds up the initial loading time of the page.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. I’ll have to look into it.<p class=message>Also, I’ve been thinking about re-architecting our system to incorporate microservices. It would allow us to break down our application into smaller, independent services.<p class="message sent">That could definitely help with scalability and maintenance.<p class=message>Exactly. And by using a service registry like Eureka, we can make it easier to discover and consume the services.<p class="message sent">Have you looked into any specific microservice frameworks to use?<p class=message>Yeah, I’ve been looking at Spring Boot. It has a lot of useful features for building microservices, like embedded servers and easy configuration.<p class="message sent">Great, I’ve worked with Spring before so that shouldn’t be too difficult to learn.<p class=message>Another thing we could incorporate is serverless computing. It would allow us to focus on the business logic instead of worrying about the infrastructure.<p class="message sent">I’ve heard a lot about that too. What platform would you recommend?<p class=message>AWS Lambda is one of the most popular, but there are other options like Azure Functions and Google Cloud Functions.<p class="message sent">It’s amazing how many different technologies there are to choose from nowadays.<p class=message>Definitely, but that’s what keeps this industry so exciting!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=68ad6df9-0ac8-4bc5-961c-d96a5f1c9815.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
