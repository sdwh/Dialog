I'm sorry to hear that. Can you please provide me with your ticket number?<p class=message>Sure, let me grab that for you. The number is 123456789.<p class="message sent">Thank you. Can you also provide me with your name and the departure and arrival cities?<p class=message>Of course, my name is John Smith and I was originally flying from New York to Los Angeles.<p class="message sent">Alright, thank you for the information. Just let me check... Okay, I have processed the refund on your ticket. You should receive the reimbursement within the next 5 business days.<p class=message>Thank you so much! I really appreciate it.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Is there anything else that I can assist you with?<p class=message>Actually, due to the same unforeseen circumstances, I need to change the date of my ticket. Is that possible?<p class="message sent">Certainly! Let me check for available flights on your preferred new date. Can I have that date, please?<p class=message>Yes, I'd like to change my flight to next Thursday.<p class="message sent">Perfect. I found a flight leaving at 2 PM next Thursday. Would that work for you?<p class=message>Yes, that's perfect! How much would the change cost?<p class="message sent">Let me see... It would be an additional $50, will that be okay with you?<p class=message>That's reasonable, thank you. Can you confirm the details of the new flight for me?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. The flight you are rescheduling to will be leaving New York at 2 PM next Thursday and arriving in Los Angeles at 4 PM. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>No, that's all for now. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Have a great day and safe travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=da7b9b1e-cf40-42f2-9adf-4e8ab272f3c5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
