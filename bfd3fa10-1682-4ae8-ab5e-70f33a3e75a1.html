How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey A, not too bad, just working on fixing some bugs. What's up?<p class=message>Actually, I was reviewing some code and found a few security vulnerabilities. I wanted to chat with you about it and see if we can get them fixed.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. Yeah, let's take a look. Which files did you find the issues in?<p class=message>Mainly in the authentication module. There's some input validation that's not being done properly, which could lead to some potentially dangerous SQL injection attacks.<p class="message sent">Oof, that does sound bad. Let me take a look at that and see if we can get it patched up.<p class=message>Great, thanks. Also, I found some issues with potential buffer overflows in the file handling parts of the app.<p class="message sent">Buffer overflows, huh? That's an old school one, but I can definitely take a look and see what's going on.<p class=message>Awesome. You know, for bugs that sound so serious, this is actually kind of fun.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I agree. It's like, we're the code detectives, solving mysteries and keeping our users safe!<p class=message>Haha, nicely put. But seriously, it's good that we do this sort of thing. Security is no joke nowadays.<p class="message sent">For sure. And fixing these issues not only makes our app safer, but it actually helps it run more smoothly too, since we're eliminating potential crash points and improving functionality.<p class=message>You know what they say, "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."<p class="message sent">True that. By the way, have you seen that new sci-fi movie that just came out?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've heard good things. You thinking about seeing it?<p class="message sent">Definitely! Maybe we can make a night of it, celebrate our successful bug squashing and all that.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. And maybe after the movie we can grab a drink, and argue about best coding practices.<p class="message sent">Hah, no arguments here. It's always good to bounce ideas off one another and learn new things.<p class=message>Agreed. Well, let's get back to work, and then plan for that night out.<p class="message sent">You got it! Thanks for bringing these bugs to my attention, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B. That's what team collaboration is all about :)</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bfcd9039-4cb8-4ee7-94d9-732fb6fcfe5d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
