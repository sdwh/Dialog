Welcome to the airport. May I ask, are you here for business or pleasure?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm actually part of a travel agency. We have a group of clients coming in on a flight soon, and I'm here to help them with their immigration process.<p class=message>Great to hear that! Just to make sure everything goes smoothly, may I ask if you have all the necessary documents and information to assist your clients?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have their passports and visa documents ready, as well as their flight and accommodation details. Is there anything else I should know?<p class=message>That sounds perfect. You just need to make sure that their documents are in order and valid for the duration of their stay. And when they reach the immigration counter, they need to have their passport, visa, and any supporting documents ready for inspection.<p class="message sent">Understood. What about the quarantine and Covid-19 measures? Will my clients need to take a test or fill out any forms?<p class=message>Yes, they will need to undergo health screenings and complete health declaration forms upon arrival. Depending on the country they're coming from, they may also need to undergo Covid-19 testing and quarantine for a period of time.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. I'll make sure to inform my clients beforehand to avoid any confusion or delays. Thank you for your help!<p class=message>You're welcome! If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to ensure a safe and smooth entry process for all travelers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6da060a1-e459-44f5-9ad9-5dbd2cf2ba91.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
