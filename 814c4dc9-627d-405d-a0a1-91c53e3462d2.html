But I always have a soft spot for sandwiches.<p class=message>Sandwiches? You mean like PB&J or something like that?<p class="message sent">No way, I like my sandwiches with some flair. Like a banh mi or a cubano.<p class=message>Woah, getting fancy. I just stick to a classic turkey sandwich myself.<p class="message sent">Nothing wrong with that. But did you know that the Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich? Legend has it that he was so engrossed in gambling that he asked for meat between two slices of bread so he wouldn't have to stop playing.<p class=message>Ha! That's hilarious. I guess we have a lot to thank the Earl for.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And these days, there are so many types of sandwiches to try. Have you ever had a lobster roll or a Philly cheesesteak?<p class=message>Actually, I haven't. But I'm always down to try something new.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit! Life's too short to eat boring sandwiches.<p class=message>Agreed. But sometimes, you just can't beat a good old grilled cheese and tomato soup combo.<p class="message sent">Oh, for sure. You can never go wrong with that. But have you tried putting bacon in your grilled cheese? It's a game-changer.<p class=message>(laughs) You might be onto something there. I think it's official - sandwiches are the best food ever.<p class="message sent">Glad we're on the same page!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=81493b16-16d5-4079-ac9d-cbf2a2d852d5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
