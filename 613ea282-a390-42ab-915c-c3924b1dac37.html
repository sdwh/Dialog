My name is Alice, and I'll be your server tonight. Have you dined with us before?<p class="message sent">G'day mate. The name's Ben. Nope, it's actually my first time here. What do you recommend I try?<p class=message>Well, since you're in Sydney, I would recommend trying our famous meat pies or some freshly caught seafood, like the Barramundi.<p class="message sent">Ah, meat pies, a true blue Aussie classic! And for the seafood, how do you prepare the Barramundi here?<p class=message>We grill it to perfection with a lemon butter sauce on top. It's one of our most popular dishes.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a winner to me. And what about for dessert?<p class=message>We offer a range of desserts, but our pavlova is definitely a must-try. It's made with fresh berries and whipped cream on a meringue base.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. I might have to save some room for that one. So, Alice, how long have you worked here?<p class=message>I've been working here for about two years now. It's a great place to work, and I love being able to recommend our customers our best dishes.<p class="message sent">Glad to hear it. And speaking of dishes, do you have any recommendations for a good white wine to pair with the Barramundi?<p class=message>Our house chardonnay goes really well with most of our seafood dishes. However, if you prefer something different, we can always recommend other varieties from our extensive wine list.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. Thanks for your help, Alice. I'll definitely be back here again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=613c297f-da2c-4cb2-854e-f3e228f657d5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
