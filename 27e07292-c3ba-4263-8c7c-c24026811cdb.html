Today we have a very special guest with us, B. B, how are you today?<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, A! I'm doing great, how about you?<p class=message>I'm doing fantastic, thanks for asking. So B, can you tell us a little bit about what you do for a living?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! I'm actually a professional dog walker. I get to spend my days outside, getting exercise, and hanging out with some of the cutest furry friends you can imagine!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like such a fun job. Are there any challenges that come with it?<p class="message sent">There are definitely challenges, like dealing with tough weather conditions or difficult dogs, but overall I really love what I do and it's very rewarding.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Is there a certain breed of dog that you enjoy walking the most?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm a big fan of golden retrievers. They're just so friendly and always up for a good time.<p class=message>Speaking of good times, do you have any exciting plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm going to a music festival with some friends. I can't wait to see some of my favorite bands perform live!<p class=message>Sounds like a blast. My weekend will be a bit more low-key, just catching up on some reading and maybe watching a movie.<p class="message sent">That sounds just as enjoyable! Sometimes it's nice to just have a relaxing weekend.<p class=message>Absolutely. Well, unfortunately that's all the time we have for today. Thank you so much for being here, B, and sharing your experience with us.<p class="message sent">Of course, it was my pleasure. Thanks for having me!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=27de772f-b74d-483a-a5b5-1e2f1f5bb72b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
