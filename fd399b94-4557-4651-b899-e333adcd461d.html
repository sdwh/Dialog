Just finishing up my ISO 27001 audit report.<p class=message>Nice, how has the audit been going for you?<p class="message sent">It's been interesting. The company has some impressive security measures in place.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've had some challenging audits lately, so I'm envious.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's nice when things go smoothly. So, what's your approach for writing the audit report?<p class=message>I start by organizing my findings by process area. Then, I highlight any areas of concern or improvement.<p class="message sent">I do the same thing. I also like to include any positive things I noticed during the audit.<p class=message>That's a good idea. It's always nice to give credit where credit is due.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's also important to make actionable recommendations for improvement.<p class=message>Agreed. We want to be helpful, not just critical. Have you ever had a really challenging report to write?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I had one where the company had almost no security measures in place. It was tough to find any positives.<p class=message>Yikes, that sounds difficult. Well, hopefully, our reports will be easy to write and helpful for the company.<p class="message sent">Fingers crossed. I think we can make a positive impact.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fd3683bd-01f0-4af3-ba75-a06ae714ce70.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
