I've been having a cough and some chest pain that's been bothering me for a few days now.<p class=message>I see. Let's take a look. *listens to B's chest*<p class="message sent">Is everything alright, doc?<p class=message>Well, I have good news and bad news. The bad news is you have a case of Bronchitis. The good news is it's treatable with medication and you'll be up and running in no time.<p class="message sent">Oh, thank goodness. I thought it might be more serious. What kind of medicine will I need to take?<p class=message>It's just some antibiotics to clear out any infection, and some over-the-counter cough medication to help manage the symptoms.<p class="message sent">That doesn't sound too bad. Can I also drink plenty of fluids?<p class=message>Absolutely. And don't forget to rest up too. Watching a good movie or reading a book might also help take your mind off things.<p class="message sent">You know what, watching some comedy movies sounds like just what I need to get through this. Any recommendations?<p class=message>Hmm, well, The Hangover never fails to crack me up, and Bridesmaids is another solid choice.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendation, doc! I'll be sure to check those out.<p class=message>No problem. Remember to take care of yourself and if anything gets worse or if you have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact me or come back for a follow-up appointment.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, doctor. I appreciate your help and advice.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7f4f8304-88ff-4354-8ee5-a05407e29d7d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
