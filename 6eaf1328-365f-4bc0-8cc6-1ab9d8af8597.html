How may I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I have a reservation for tonight under the name Smith.<p class=message>Great, let me check that for you. Yes, Mr. Smith, we have your reservation for a deluxe room. I just need to see your ID and credit card please.<p class="message sent">Sure, here they are.<p class=message>Thank you very much. That all looks good, so your room is on the fifth floor. Can I help with your bags?<p class="message sent">No, thank you. I only have a backpack.<p class=message>Alright, the elevator is just over there on the left. Your room number is 502. Here's your keycard. Enjoy your stay!<p class="message sent">Thanks. Can you recommend somewhere nearby to grab a drink or bite to eat?<p class=message>Of course. We have a restaurant on the ground floor that serves dinner until 10 pm, and our bar is open until midnight. There's also a great pub just a few blocks away.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, thanks. Do you have any gym or pool facilities?<p class=message>Yes, our fitness center is on the third floor and open 24 hours a day. We also have an indoor pool and hot tub on the same floor, accessible with your room key.<p class="message sent">Perfect, thanks for letting me know.<p class=message>Is there anything else you need assistance with?<p class="message sent">Actually, could you recommend any nearby attractions or must-see places?<p class=message>Sure, the National Gallery of Australia and the Parliament House are both within walking distance. And if you have a bit more time, the Australian War Memorial is definitely worth a visit.<p class="message sent">That's great to know, thanks. Well, I better head up to my room and freshen up. Thanks for your help.<p class=message>You're very welcome. If you need anything else during your stay, don't hesitate to let us know. Have a great night!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6ea25eff-1bab-4257-a2a2-f7885c0c3b4c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
