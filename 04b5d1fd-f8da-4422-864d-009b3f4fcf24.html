Have you?<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, I stopped by earlier today during our patrol. I highly recommend it.<p class="message sent message-content">Maybe we can swing by there on our break later. You know how much I love donuts.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds like a plan. But first, we need to make sure the streets are safe and secure.<p class="message sent message-content">Agreed. Speaking of which, have you noticed any suspicious activities around here lately?<p class="message received message-content">Not really, but I did catch a kid trying to graffiti the wall near the park yesterday. I gave him a stern warning and he ran off.<p class="message sent message-content">Good job. We need to show these kids that vandalism is not acceptable in our community.<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely. It's all about maintaining the peace and keeping our neighborhood safe.<p class="message sent message-content">Hey, did you hear about the new basketball court they're building in the park?<p class="message received message-content">No, I hadn't heard that. That's great news! It'll be nice to see the kids playing ball instead of getting into trouble.<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, I think it'll bring the community together too. Maybe we can even organize some friendly competitions.<p class="message received message-content">That's a great idea. Let's make it a goal to promote positive activities for the youth in our area.<p class="message sent message-content">Agreed. Anyway, let's get back to patrolling. We don't want to neglect our duty.<p class="message received message-content">Right you are. And don't forget, we have a date with some delicious donuts later.<p class="message sent message-content">How can I forget? My stomach is already growling just thinking about it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=04b4fa7f-ab1e-46ff-93bb-f30940582cbe.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
