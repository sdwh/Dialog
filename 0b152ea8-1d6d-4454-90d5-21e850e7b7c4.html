Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent message-content">Hi, I'm the red braised pork chef. It's great to meet you too.<p class="message received message-content">So, we're here in the Siam district to learn how to make authentic Thai red braised pork and side dishes. Are you excited?<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely! Thai cuisine is one of my favorites, and I can't wait to learn from the best.<p class="message received message-content">Me too! Let's get started. We'll be making red braised pork with boiled eggs, stir-fried kale with garlic, and sticky rice. Are you familiar with these dishes?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I have cooked them before, but I'm excited to learn some new tips and tricks.<p class="message received message-content">That's great. Let's start with the red braised pork. The key to this dish is to marinate the pork in a combination of soy sauce, sugar, and spices. Then, we'll braise it in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, and water until it becomes tender.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds easy enough. What's next?<p class="message received message-content">While the pork is cooking, we'll boil some eggs, and prepare the stir-fried kale with garlic. It's important to use fresh ingredients and cook them quickly over high heat.<p class="message sent message-content">I agree. And what about the sticky rice?<p class="message received message-content">That's also easy. We just need to soak the rice in water for a few hours, then steam it until it becomes sticky and fluffy.<p class="message sent message-content">Great! This is going to be a delicious meal.<p class="message received message-content">Yes, it will. And we'll also learn some tips on how to plate the dishes, and how to present them to our customers.<p class="message sent message-content">I'm excited to learn that too. Let's get started!<p class="message received message-content">Let's do it. And don't forget, we can also enjoy our creations after we finish cooking them.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0b111352-b8cf-4ff5-a8ce-c6af5a12b498.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
