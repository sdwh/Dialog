Need a hand with all those boxes?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. I can't possibly carry all of them on my own.<p class=message>No worries, I've got your back. You're a pilot, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct. How did you know?<p class=message>Well, it's not every day a uniformed person shows up at the cargo terminal, and I've been doing this job for a while.<p class="message sent">Fair enough. So, do you enjoy your work as a cargo handler?<p class=message>Oh, sure. It keeps me on my feet and I get to meet a lot of interesting people.<p class="message sent">I bet you do. I've flown with a lot of different airlines and each one seems to have their own unique way of handling cargo.<p class=message>Absolutely. We take pride in doing it right, no matter what we're handling.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. I want to make sure everything arrives safely at its destination.<p class=message>You and me both. Speaking of which, how about we load this last crate and you tell me about a crazy flight you've had?<p class="message sent">Ha! I've been on a few crazy ones. There was this one time when we had a passenger who refused to buckle their seatbelt...<p class=message>Oh no! That's never a good situation.<p class="message sent">Nope, it sure isn't. But we managed to handle it without any major issues.<p class=message>You must have nerves of steel. I don't think I could handle that much responsibility.<p class="message sent">It's all in a day's work, my friend. Just like loading cargo.<p class=message>Well, I definitely appreciate what you do. And thanks for letting me help out today.<p class="message sent">Don't mention it. It was great working with you. Maybe we'll cross paths again sometime.<p class=message>I hope so. Keep those planes in the sky, Captain!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=84e5058b-3780-4fb4-b7cb-ccc88bf595e6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
