Do you know any interesting places?<p class=message>Sure! There's Federation Square, the Royal Botanic Gardens, and the National Gallery of Victoria. What are you in the mood for?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'd like to start with the gardens.<p class=message>You got it. The gardens are beautiful this time of year. Have you seen many kangaroos since you've arrived?<p class="message sent">No, do you think we'll see some?<p class=message>We might, sometimes they come out and eat the grass early in the morning. Speaking of eating, have you tried any Melbourne-style cuisine yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, what do you recommend?<p class=message>You can't go wrong with a classic meat pie from one of the local bakeries. And if you're feeling adventurous, there's always Vegemite.<p class="message sent">I've heard of that, what does it taste like?<p class=message>It's hard to describe, but it's definitely an acquired taste. Some love it, some hate it.<p class="message sent">I'll have to give it a try. What's your favorite thing about living in Melbourne?<p class=message>I love the diversity of the city. There's always something new to discover, whether it's a new restaurant or a hidden street art mural.<p class="message sent">That sounds wonderful. I'm glad I came here. Thanks for showing me around.<p class=message>My pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9f738850-47be-4f6e-acb3-74626b4a8ada.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
