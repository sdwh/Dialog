It's a standard for information security management systems.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. So, what's the deal with ISO 27001? Why is it important?<p class=message>Well, it sets out the requirements for keeping sensitive information secure, which is pretty important in today's digital age.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I can imagine. But is it really necessary for all businesses to comply with it?<p class=message>Not necessarily, but it can certainly help with risk management and reassure customers that their data is being handled appropriately.<p class="message sent">Okay, I see what you mean. But isn't it really complicated to implement?<p class=message>Not necessarily! There are resources and training available to help businesses implement it smoothly.<p class="message sent">Ah, that's good to know. So, how can we get started if we wanted to implement ISO 27001?<p class=message>Well, first we need to assess our current information security practices and identify any areas that need improvement.<p class="message sent">Got it. And then?<p class=message>Then we need to develop a plan for implementing the necessary changes and train our staff on how to comply with the standard.<p class="message sent">Sounds like it could be a lot of work.<p class=message>It definitely can be, but it's worth it to ensure the security of our information and protect our customers' trust.<p class="message sent">Yeah, you're right. Thanks for explaining all of this to me, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=289d6b0c-cc7e-404f-917f-03ee089bf9ed.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
