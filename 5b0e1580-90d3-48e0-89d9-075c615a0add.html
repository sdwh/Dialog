I'm a travel consultant and I've got a group of tourists who need to rent cars to explore Melbourne. Can you help me pick the right cars for them?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What kind of group is it?<p class=message>It's a family of four and a group of friends consisting of five people.<p class="message sent">Okay, we have a variety of options available for you. We could recommend a couple of SUVs or minivans for the family, and maybe two smaller vehicles for the group of friends.<p class=message>Sounds great! Do you have any recommendations on scenic routes around Melbourne?<p class="message sent">Definitely! One of the most popular routes is the Great Ocean Road, which is a beautiful coastal drive with breathtaking views. Another option would be to drive to Phillip Island to see the penguins.<p class=message>Wow, those sound amazing! On a lighter note, do you have any hidden gems in Melbourne that tourists might not know about?<p class="message sent">Well, there's a little-known bar called "Section 8" that's made out of shipping containers. It's a cool spot to grab a drink and socialize. Another fun thing to do is explore the famous laneways of Melbourne, which are packed with street art and quirky shops.<p class=message>Those are great suggestions! I'll definitely pass those on to my clients. Thanks for your help!<p class="message sent">No problem at all! Let me know if you need anything else, and enjoy exploring Melbourne!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5b0868ce-b4d9-4e47-8626-21a05b3d5af7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
