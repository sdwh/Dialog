Have you heard about it too?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. And I heard it's going to be developed using Bootstrap and ASP.NET MVC 5.<p class=message>Yeah, that's what I heard too. I'm excited to use Bootstrap, it's really easy to use and the results are awesome!<p class="message sent">I agree with you. Bootstrap makes website development a lot easier and quicker. ASP.NET MVC 5 is also great for building websites.<p class=message>I'm glad we're on the same page. What do you think about the overall design of the website? Should we go for a simple and clean look?<p class="message sent">Definitely. The simpler, the better. It's easier to navigate and understand for users. Plus, it's more visually appealing.<p class=message>I totally agree with you. And what about the color scheme? Should we go for blue and white, or maybe a colorful approach?<p class="message sent">Blue and white is a safe choice, but why not add some bright colors to make it more lively?<p class=message>That's a good point! We can add colors to buttons and other elements to give the website some personality.<p class="message sent">Speaking of buttons, have you checked out Bootstrap's button features? They're so cool!<p class=message>Yes, I have! They're super easy to use and very customizable. We can make our buttons stand out and look great.<p class="message sent">That's right. We want to make sure the website is not only functional, but also aesthetically pleasing.<p class=message>Exactly! We want to impress our users with both the functionality and design of the website. I think we're going to make a great team, B.<p class="message sent">Agreed! I'm excited to work with you on this project. Let's create a website that everyone will love!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f13239a5-bfef-4467-84fd-45564d0ee2bf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
