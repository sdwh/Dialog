What do you think?<p class=message>It looks really nice! Did you design it yourself?<p class="message sent">No, I found the pattern online. I'm not that creative.<p class=message>That's okay, you're still talented. I could never sew something like that.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Mom. Do you want me to teach you how to sew?<p class=message>I don't think I have the patience for it. Plus, I'd rather just buy my clothes.<p class="message sent">Haha, I understand. Sewing can be a bit tedious.<p class=message>How long have you been sewing for?<p class="message sent">I started in high school, so it's been about five years now.<p class=message>Wow, you're really dedicated to it. Have you ever considered pursuing it as a career?<p class="message sent">Not really, I just enjoy it as a hobby. Plus, I don't know if I'm good enough to make a living from it.<p class=message>Well, you're definitely good enough to make clothes for me. Maybe you can start a side business someday.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea, Mom. Maybe I'll think about it once I get better.<p class=message>I'm sure you'll do great. Have you thought about what fabrics you want to use for future projects?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been eyeing some cute floral prints lately. I think they'll be perfect for spring dresses.<p class=message>I agree, those would be lovely. Maybe you can make matching dresses for us!<p class="message sent">Haha, that sounds like fun. We'll be the mother-daughter duo in matching floral dresses.<p class=message>I can't wait, it'll be like our own little fashion show. I'm so proud of you, B.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Mom. And thanks for always being supportive of my hobbies.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fc5effa7-0ca6-45e9-a96c-13c9dbafed90.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
