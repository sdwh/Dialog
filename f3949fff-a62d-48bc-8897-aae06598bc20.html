How's your day going?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. Everything's good, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>Pretty busy, as usual. But we can't complain, right? So, how's the project coming along?<p class="message sent">It's going well, I think. I've been doing some research online and found some interesting ideas that I want to share with you.<p class=message>That's great! I'm always open to new ideas. What have you found?<p class="message sent">Well, I stumbled upon a TED talk about creative problem solving and I think we could use some of those techniques for this project.<p class=message>I love TED talks! Which one was it?<p class="message sent">It was by Tim Brown, the CEO of IDEO. He talked about using design thinking to come up with innovative solutions.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. Let's watch it together in our next meeting.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Also, I wanted to ask you about the deadline. Is it still next Friday?<p class=message>Yes, it is. But we're making good progress, so I think we'll be able to finish on time.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I'm learning so much from working on this project with you.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. And don't hesitate to ask me anything if you have questions or need help.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. You've been a great mentor so far.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. I was once an intern myself, so I know how it feels.<p class="message sent">That's comforting to hear. I hope to be as knowledgeable and helpful as you someday.<p class=message>Keep working hard and you'll get there, B. Remember, every little bit counts.<p class="message sent">I will. Thanks, A. I appreciate your words of wisdom.<p class=message>No problem at all. Now, let's get back to work and finish this project strong!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f3932fb3-13ef-44dd-a87d-da583ce0db67.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
