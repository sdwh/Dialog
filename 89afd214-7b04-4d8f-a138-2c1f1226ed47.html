Want to share a sushi platter?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! What about a side dish? Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">The gyoza are pretty tasty. Or we could try the edamame.<p class=message>Let's get both! I can't resist a good gyoza and I haven't had edamame in ages.<p class="message sent">Good call. So, how's your day been so far?<p class=message>It's been pretty busy at work, but I'm just happy to be having lunch with you. What about you?<p class="message sent">Same here. I had a bunch of errands to run this morning. Glad to finally sit down and relax.<p class=message>Me too. So, have you watched any good shows lately?<p class="message sent">Yes! I just finished binge-watching a Korean drama. The storyline was so addicting.<p class=message>Ooh, which one?<p class="message sent">It's called "Crash Landing on You". Have you heard of it?<p class=message>Yes, I've heard great things about that one. I'll have to check it out.<p class="message sent">Definitely do. I guarantee you'll be hooked after the first episode.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation. Speaking of Korean culture, have you tried any new Korean food places in town?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have! There's this new Korean fried chicken spot that just opened up. Their chicken is out of this world.<p class=message>Oh man, now I'm getting hungry all over again. Let's finish our lunch quickly so we can plan our next food outing.<p class="message sent">Agreed! But you know we can't leave without getting some green tea ice cream for dessert.<p class=message>Of course not. I already have my spoon ready.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=89ae4192-5d0a-47af-a9df-5bd1975dcd3d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
