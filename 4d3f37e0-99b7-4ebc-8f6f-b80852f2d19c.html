But instead of getting frustrated, Teacher A made a game out of it and they had so much fun.<p class="message sent">That's so cool! What kind of game did they play?<p class=message>They played a grammar tic-tac-toe where B had to complete sentences with the correct grammar before placing his X or O.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a creative way of teaching. Did it work?<p class=message>Yes, it did! B ended up acing the quiz on grammar the next day.<p class="message sent">That's awesome! I wish my teachers were that fun.<p class=message>I know right? Teacher A is a great role model for teachers. He always finds a way to make learning engaging and enjoyable.<p class="message sent">I agree. I've heard he even brought in a guitar and sang songs related to the lessons.<p class=message>Yes! And he also used memes and popular culture references to explain complex concepts.<p class="message sent">I wish I had taken his class. Do you think he'll teach again next semester?<p class=message>I'm not sure, but I'm definitely signing up for his class if he does.<p class="message sent">Same here. Cheers to creative and fun teaching!<p class=message>Cheers indeed!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4d3e2db1-7b0e-4363-bcc1-1a328edfcc84.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
