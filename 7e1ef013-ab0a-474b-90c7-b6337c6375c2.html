It seems to be sold out everywhere!<p class=message>That's a bummer. Did you try checking online?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did. But the shipping time would take too long and I need it sooner.<p class=message>Have you looked into any similar toys that can serve the same purpose?<p class="message sent">I have, but nothing seems to really compare.<p class=message>Hmm, well maybe you can try calling around to different stores to see if they have any in stock.<p class="message sent">Good idea, I'll give that a shot.<p class="message sent">I called a few stores, but no luck. You have any other suggestions?<p class=message>How about posting on social media to see if anyone has the toy and is willing to sell it?<p class="message sent">Oh, I didn't think of that. I'll give it a try.<p class=message>And if all else fails, maybe consider buying a used one or waiting until it's back in stock.<p class="message sent">I was hoping to get a brand new one, but I may have to settle for a used one or wait it out. Thanks for your help!<p class=message>No problem, good luck with your toy search!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7e1c4682-32d0-4c1b-8bba-ca0d06df2ff3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
