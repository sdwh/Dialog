It looks like we have some work to do.<p class="message received message-content">Definitely. We found a few vulnerabilities in the login system that need to be patched ASAP.<p class="message sent message-content">Okay, let's get on it. Do you have any suggestions on where to start?<p class="message received message-content">I think we should start by reviewing the code and identifying any potential security holes.<p class="message sent message-content">Good idea. And we could also implement multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.<p class="message received message-content">Great point. And we should also run some more tests to make sure the fixes actually work.<p class="message sent message-content">Agreed. We don't want to leave any stone unturned.<p class="message received message-content">By the way, did you hear about that famous hacker who was arrested last week?<p class="message sent message-content">No, I didn't. What happened?<p class="message received message-content">Apparently, he hacked into a bank's system and stole $100,000. But he got caught because he used his real name in the email addresses he created for the operation!<p class="message sent message-content">*laughs* You gotta be kidding me!<p class="message received message-content">Nope, it's true. That just goes to show how important it is for hackers to cover their tracks.<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely. And it also shows how important it is for companies like ours to have strong security measures in place.<p class="message received message-content">That's for sure. But hey, at least we're doing our part to make the Internet a safer place.<p class="message sent message-content">*smiling* Yep, one code fix at a time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0bf93a37-8815-43d0-b6a6-c74fd03f98d6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
