Who was he?<p class="message sent">Ah, that's my grandpa. We go for walks regularly.<p class=message>That's so sweet! I miss my grandpa. What do you guys do on your walks?<p class="message sent">We discuss everything from the weather to politics.<p class=message>That's interesting. Does your grandpa ever surprise you with something unexpected?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! One time, he challenged me to a race and beat me even though he's in his 80s!<p class=message>No way! That's amazing. Does he always beat you at everything?<p class="message sent">Well, he definitely has more life experience than me, but I can still beat him at some things.<p class=message>What kind of things?<p class="message sent">Chess, for example. I beat him yesterday!<p class=message>Wow, grandpa has some tough competition then. Do you think he enjoys your walks together?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. He's always talking about how great it is to spend time with me and we have lots of fun.<p class=message>That's so heartwarming. You're making memories that will last a lifetime.<p class="message sent">I know, I'm lucky to have him. He's the best grandpa anyone could ask for.<p class=message>It sounds like you guys have a great relationship.
