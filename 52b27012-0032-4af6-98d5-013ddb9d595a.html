I've been driving for about 10 years now. I love it - every day is a new adventure!<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you have any favorite places you like to take your customers?<p class="message sent">Oh yes! Hokkaido is definitely one of my favorites. I love taking tourists there because there are so many fun things to do and see.<p class=message>Awesome! I'm actually headed there now. What do you recommend I check out while I'm there?<p class="message sent">Well, you have to try the local food! The seafood is amazing. And if you like skiing, there are some great mountains up there too.<p class=message>Oh, I definitely want to try the seafood. What's your favorite Hokkaido dish?<p class="message sent">I can't pick just one! But I love uni (sea urchin) and crab. Have you tried those before?<p class=message>No, but I'm definitely willing to give them a try!<p class="message sent">Great! You won't regret it. By the way, have you been to Japan before?<p class=message>Yes, I actually came here on a study abroad program a few years ago.<p class="message sent">That's cool! What did you study?<p class=message>Japanese language and culture.<p class="message sent">Wow, your Japanese is really good. Where did you learn it?<p class=message>Thank you! I learned it in college and also from my host family when I was studying abroad.<p class="message sent">That's so cool! Speaking of which, have you tried any Japanese snacks before?<p class=message>Yes, I love Pocky and Kit Kats. Do you have a favorite?<p class="message sent">Yes! I love senbei (rice crackers) and hiyoko cakes. They're both so delicious.<p class=message>I'll have to keep an eye out for those. Thanks for the tip!<p class="message sent">No problem. It's always fun to try new things. We're almost there by the way. Is there anything else you need to know before we arrive?<p class=message>No, I think that's it. Thank you for the great conversation and for the ride!<p class="message sent">You're welcome!
