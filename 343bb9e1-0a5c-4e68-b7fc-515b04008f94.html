Nice to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Hi, glad to meet you too. I'm the database administrator.<p class=message>Great, we have an important topic to discuss today. How can we protect our customer’s personal data and financial transactions from cyber threats?<p class="message sent">Yeah, security is crucial in our industry. We need to ensure that our data is encrypted, and access is restricted to authorized personnel only.<p class=message>Exactly, we should also enforce multi-factor authentication and conduct regular vulnerability assessments.<p class="message sent">Yes, and it's essential to have a strong disaster recovery plan, just in case something goes wrong.<p class=message>Absolutely, and we need to keep up-to-date with the latest threats and invest in the newest technology available.<p class="message sent">Of course, we should also promote a culture of security and provide regular training to our employees to prevent human errors.<p class=message>Yes, well said, B. By the way, have you heard the one about the bank that got robbed by a hacker?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Tell me more.<p class=message>They say the hacker got away with all of the bank’s money by clicking on the “transfer to personal account” button.<p class="message sent">Ha! Good one. But seriously, we need to be more diligent in preventing that kind of thing from happening.<p class=message>Yes, let's make sure our systems and procedures are up to scratch so that we can protect our institution and our customers from cyber threats.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's been great talking with you, A. I'm off to review our security measures now.<p class=message>Sounds good, B. It's always good to have someone like you looking out for our customers.
