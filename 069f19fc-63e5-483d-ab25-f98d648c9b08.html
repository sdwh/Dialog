It's great to work with you here at Shantilly's pastry shop.<p class="message sent">Hi A! It's my pleasure to work with you too. I have heard so much about your French pastry skills.<p class=message>Oh, thank you! I see that you have all kinds of Japanese tea here. Do you have any recommendations to go with my lovely macarons?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A. I think Sencha tea would go well with your delicate macarons. It has a grassy and refreshing flavor that will balance them out.<p class=message>That sounds wonderful! And what pastry would you recommend to eat along with your tea?<p class="message sent">Definitely our famous matcha roll cake. It's made from premium matcha powder and has a hint of sweetness that pairs perfectly with the tea.<p class=message>Wow, sounds like a match made in heaven! I can't wait to try it out.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A. And if you ever need any tips or tricks for your French pastries, feel free to ask me anytime.<p class=message>Likewise, B! I think it's great that we can learn so much from each other's culinary backgrounds.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! That's what a good collaboration is all about. Sharing ideas and creating something new together.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have you ever tried adding matcha to any of your pastries?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have experimented with matcha eclairs before. They turned out pretty delicious actually.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds amazing! We should definitely try incorporating matcha into one of our French-Japanese pastry fusion creations.<p class="message sent">I'm all for it, A! Let's get to work and make something extra special for our customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=069b8574-4120-4a8e-9357-367905cd3497.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
