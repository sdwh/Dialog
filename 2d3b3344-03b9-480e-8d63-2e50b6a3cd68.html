How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was great, I went hiking with my friends. How about you, Teacher A?<p class=message>I stayed at home and finally finished reading a book I've been meaning to read for months.<p class="message sent">What was the book about?<p class=message>It's a mystery novel about a detective trying to solve a crime. I really enjoyed it.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Maybe I'll borrow it from you when you're done with it.<p class=message>Sure, I'd be happy to lend it to you. So, let's start our lesson for today. We're going to learn about idioms and their meanings.<p class="message sent">Oh, I like learning idioms. They make conversations more colorful and fun.<p class=message>Exactly. For example, do you know what "barking up the wrong tree" means?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not sure. Does it mean trying to do something impossible?<p class=message>Close. It actually means accusing the wrong person or pursuing the wrong thing.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. That makes sense. Can you give us another example?<p class=message>Sure. How about "to let the cat out of the bag"?<p class="message sent">That's a funny one. Does it have something to do with cats?<p class=message>Not really. It means to reveal a secret or something that was supposed to be kept hidden.<p class="message sent">Ah, I get it now. I'll try to use these idioms in my conversations from now on.<p class=message>Great idea. Learning and using idioms will make your English sound more natural and fluent.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2d3865fb-3d9a-4de0-abc0-cc65c00edc19.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
