How about you?<p class=message>Yeah, I do. What's your favorite sport?<p class="message sent">My favorite sport is basketball. What about you?<p class=message>I love to play tennis. It's great exercise and a lot of fun.<p class="message sent">Tennis is fun, but I'm not very good at it. How long have you been playing?<p class=message>I've been playing tennis for about five years now. It takes practice to get better.<p class="message sent">That's true. I'm more of a runner myself. Have you ever tried running?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. I think it's a good way to stay in shape, but I prefer a sport where I can be more competitive.<p class="message sent">I know what you mean. Do you play any other sports?<p class=message>I also like to play volleyball with my friends. It's a great way to socialize and get exercise at the same time.<p class="message sent">That sounds like fun. It's always great to have a group to play sports with.<p class=message>Definitely. I think having a group of people to play with makes it more enjoyable.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Have you ever played any team sports?<p class=message>Yeah, I used to play soccer when I was in high school. It was a lot of fun, but I haven't played in years.<p class="message sent">Soccer is a great team sport. I used to play on a team too, but now I just play for fun.<p class=message>Yeah, it's hard to find time to play on a team when you have other priorities.<p class="message sent">That's true. But as long as we're staying active, that's what really matters.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's important to take care of our health, and exercise is a big part of that.<p class="message sent">For sure. Hey, do you want to go for a run together sometime?<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. Let's plan on it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=10d12292-3f72-40c0-b75f-a38b307bc76b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
