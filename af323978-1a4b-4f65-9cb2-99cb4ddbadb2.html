My luggage got lost on my flight, and I'm not sure what to do about it.<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?<p class=message>Well, I flew in last night and when I got to baggage claim, my bags weren't there. I waited around for a while and talked to some other people who were waiting, but eventually had to give up and go home.<p class="message sent">That's definitely frustrating. Did you happen to fill out a lost luggage report with our airline staff before you left the airport?<p class=message>No, I didn't. I wasn't really sure who to talk to, and I was in a bit of a hurry to get home.<p class="message sent">I understand. Well, in this case, the first order of business is definitely to fill out a report with us. We'll take down all the relevant information and try to locate your luggage.<p class=message>Okay, thank you. I just hope I can get my stuff back soon - I had some souvenirs in there that I really don't want to lose.<p class="message sent">Don't worry too much. Sometimes bags just get misplaced, but they usually turn up eventually - and in the meantime, we can provide you with a toiletry kit and other essentials while you wait.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I guess I'll go ahead and file that report now.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll help you through the process. And in the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>No, I think that's all for now. Thank you so much for your help.<p class="message sent">Of course, any time. We'll be sure to update you as soon as we have any information on your luggage. Is there a good number to reach you at?<p class=message>Yes, I'll give you my cell phone number. Thanks again!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=af2e8769-995e-4975-9738-a4301773eedf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
