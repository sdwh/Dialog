How can I assist you, Director A?<p class=message>I would like to discuss the course schedule for the upcoming semester. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Yes, I was thinking that we could incorporate more group projects into the curriculum. It would allow for more collaboration and critical thinking.<p class=message>That's a great idea! I also think we should add a new elective course in digital marketing. It's a popular field and would attract more students.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. And what about the scheduling of the courses? Should we have more afternoon classes or morning classes?<p class=message>I think we should have a balance between both. Some students prefer early classes, while others prefer afternoon classes. We can also consider offering online classes for those who cannot attend in person.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. And what about the class size? Do you think we should limit the number of students per class?<p class=message>I do think it's important to have smaller class sizes for more individual attention, but we also need to consider the resources available to us.<p class="message sent">Understood. Well, these are all great suggestions. We will need to finalize the schedule soon and make sure it's published on time for students to register.<p class=message>Agreed. Thank you for your input, Professor B. This was a productive conversation.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Director A. I'm looking forward to seeing the finalized schedule. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99c2f4aa-fb65-41d5-96ea-423db487ff23.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
