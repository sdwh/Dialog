You were really killin' it out there.<p class="message sent">Thanks A, it's been great working with you so far. I'm having a blast on this set.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. So, have you had a chance to explore much of Melbourne since you've been here?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I went out for some sightseeing yesterday. I checked out the Great Ocean Road and the Twelve Apostles.<p class=message>Sounds like a fun day. Did you get any good photos?<p class="message sent">Tons! I posted a few on my Instagram, did you see them?<p class=message>No, I haven't had a chance to check my socials yet today. I'll make sure to give them a look later.<p class="message sent">Haha, don't worry about it. So, how did you become a film director?<p class=message>It was a bit of a long road, honestly. I started out as a boom operator, worked my way up to assistant director, and eventually got my chance to direct my own feature film.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's really impressive. I can't imagine how much work it must have taken to get there.<p class=message>Let's just say I drank a lot of espresso along the way. Speaking of which, want to grab a coffee after we wrap up today?<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds great. Where do you like to go around here?<p class=message>There's a really cool little shop down on Flinders Lane that I like. They have some of the best flat whites in town.<p class="message sent">Awesome, I'm down for that. So, do you have any upcoming projects after this one wraps?<p class=message>Yeah, actually, I've already lined up my next film. It's going to be a thriller set in the Australian outback.<p class="message sent">Sounds intense. Do you have any actors in mind yet?<p class=message>I have a few ideas, but nothing set in stone yet. Interested in auditioning?<p class="message sent">Hell yeah, count me in! I'm always up for a challenge.<p class=message>I knew I could count on you. Alright, let's finish up this shot and then we'll head over to that coffee place.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, boss. Let's get it done!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99b9bc6e-dc9a-4ce3-a3e0-2d50c9949568.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
