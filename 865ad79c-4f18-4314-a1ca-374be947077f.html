I've got some tricks up my sleeve when it comes to formatting.<p class="message sent">That would be great, thanks! Also, did you hear about the office party they're planning for next month?<p class=message>Yes, I did. The rumor is that they're going to have a karaoke machine.<p class="message sent">Oh no, I hope I don't embarrass myself singing in front of everyone.<p class=message>Don't worry, the key is to pick a song that everyone knows and can sing along with. And maybe a little liquid courage will help too.<p class="message sent">Ha! That's true, but I don't think I'll be having too much to drink this time. I don't want to be the one passed out in the corner.<p class=message>Are you telling me that didn't happen at the last office party?<p class="message sent">No comment.<p class=message>Alright, fair enough. But let's get back to the report. Have you added in all the necessary data?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. I just need to double-check the figures and make sure everything is accurate.<p class=message>Perfect. Once that's done, we can go grab some coffee together if you're up for it?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Let's get this report out of the way first though.<p class=message>Agreed. Then we can relax and indulge in a caffeine fix.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. This report has been giving me a headache.<p class=message>A headache that only coffee can cure.<p class="message sent">You got that right.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=86539f5c-796b-48ee-891f-f7f7ac974f26.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
