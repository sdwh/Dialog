Today we have a very special guest, B, who is an expert in origami. B, can you tell us more about your passion for origami?<p class="message sent">Sure, I have always been fascinated by the art of paper folding. It's amazing what you can create with just a single sheet of paper.<p class=message>That's really interesting. What's the most complex origami creation you've ever made?<p class="message sent">I once made a paper dragon that had a wingspan of over a meter. It took me several days of folding to complete.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. So, do you have any tips for anyone wanting to try origami for the first time?<p class="message sent">My advice would be to start with simple designs and work your way up. And don't be afraid to make mistakes, that's how you learn.<p class=message>Good advice. Besides origami, what other hobbies do you have?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm also a big fan of hiking and exploring new places. I find it's a great way to relax and recharge.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. Any interesting travel stories you'd like to share?<p class="message sent">One time, I went hiking in the mountains of Japan and stumbled upon a hidden temple that was over 500 years old. It was an unforgettable experience.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. Before we wrap up, could you show us how to make a simple origami design?<p class="message sent">Of course. Let me just grab some paper and I'll walk you through the steps.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ae90f149-eb00-4824-8a6a-0cc867e0338f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
