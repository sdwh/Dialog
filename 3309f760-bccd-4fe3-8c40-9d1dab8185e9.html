How's it going?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Not too bad, thanks for asking. Busy as usual. What about you?<p class=message>Oh, you know, same old same old. Baking up a storm and keeping things running smoothly.<p class="message sent">Glad to hear it. I was just thinking - have you ever entered any baking competitions?<p class=message>Actually, I have! A few years ago, I entered a statewide baking competition and won second place with my lemon meringue pie.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive! No wonder our baked goods are always so delicious.<p class=message>Thanks. I really do take pride in my work. Speaking of which, do you have any special orders coming up that I should prepare for?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. We have a wedding coming up and the couple wants a beautiful display of cupcakes. Can you take care of it?<p class=message>Of course, I'd be happy to. How many cupcakes are we talking?<p class="message sent">They requested 150 cupcakes, with a mix of flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and red velvet.<p class=message>Not a problem. I'll schedule some extra time in the kitchen to make sure they come out perfect.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear, A. You always do such a great job.<p class=message>Thanks, B. It's easy to bake when you have such a supportive boss.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well, I try my best.<p class=message>Speaking of support, how's your son doing with the Little League team?<p class="message sent">He's doing great, thanks for asking. They won their last game, 5-2.<p class=message>That's fantastic! I'm sure he'll make it to the big leagues someday.<p class="message sent">(laughs) We'll see about that. But for now, I'll just enjoy watching him grow and learn.<p class=message>That's the best attitude to have. Well, I better get back to baking. Thanks for chatting, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. And keep up the great work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=33071551-00b3-4b7d-87da-f4512105a66c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
