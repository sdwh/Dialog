I'm really excited for today's training.<p class="message sent">Good morning A, that's great to hear. What type of training do you feel like doing today?<p class=message>I was thinking we could work on my agility and footwork. I want to be quicker on the field.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. We can do some ladder drills and cone drills to work on your footwork.<p class=message>Awesome! Do you think we could also practice some shooting and passing drills?<p class="message sent">Of course. We can never have too much practice with those skills.<p class=message>I agree. I'm hoping to score more goals this season.<p class="message sent">With enough practice, you'll be unstoppable out there.<p class=message>Thanks, Coach. You always know how to motivate me.<p class="message sent">No problem. That's what I'm here for.<p class=message>By the way, have you heard about the new referee rules for this season?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's important to stay updated on the latest rules and regulations.<p class=message>Definitely. I don't want to accidentally commit a foul and get a yellow card.<p class="message sent">Well then let's make sure you're not committing any fouls during training so you can avoid that.<p class=message>Haha, good point. I'll make sure to play fair.<p class="message sent">Great attitude, A. Keep that up and you'll be a great asset to the team.<p class=message>Thank you, Coach B. Let's get started with the training now!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=00919edb-586a-4500-89d4-9f680278fa35.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
