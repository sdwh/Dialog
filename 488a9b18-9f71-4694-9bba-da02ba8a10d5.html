But you can't deny that my magic helped us escape.<p class="message sent">True, but let's hope we don't run into any more dragons.<p class=message>Agreed. By the way, what's your plan for when we rescue the princess?<p class="message sent">I was thinking we could distract the enemy with some sword fighting while she makes her escape.<p class=message>Sounds like a solid plan, but don't forget my magic can be a great distraction too.<p class="message sent">Fine, but only if you promise to use it wisely.<p class=message>Deal. Now let's get going, time's running out for the princess!<p class="message sent">Right behind you, buddy. Let's do this!<p class=message>Hey, did you remember to bring those healing potions?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've got them right here. We might need them once we reach the princess.<p class=message>You always think ahead. That's why you're my favorite partner in crime.<p class="message sent">And you're my favorite magician.
