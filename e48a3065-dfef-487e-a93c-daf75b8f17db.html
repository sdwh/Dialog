How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was great! I went to a BBQ party with my friends. What about you?<p class=message>Sounds like fun! I visited the Houston Space Center with my family. It was amazing!<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Anyway, let's get started with the day. What's on the agenda for today?<p class=message>We have to make a batch of croissants, scones, and muffins for the afternoon rush. And we also have an order for a custom cake.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a busy day ahead. By the way, have you tried the new coffee blend I brought in?<p class=message>Not yet. What's so special about it?<p class="message sent">It's a blend of Jamaican Blue Mountain and Sumatra Mandheling, with a hint of cinnamon. It's a game-changer.<p class=message>Whoa! That sounds amazing. I'll definitely try it.<p class="message sent">Great! Let me know your thoughts. And hey, have you heard about the bread making competition next week?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What is it about?<p class="message sent">It's a statewide competition for bread-makers. And guess what? I have entered our signature sourdough bread!<p class=message>That's impressive, B! I'm sure we will win.<p class="message sent">I hope so! Oh, and by the way, have you seen the new interns we got?<p class=message>Yeah, I met them yesterday. They seem enthusiastic.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. We need their help today, so I hope they catch on quickly.<p class=message>I'm sure they will. We'll show them the ropes.
