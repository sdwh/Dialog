How are you today?<p class="message sent">Hello! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well too, thanks. So, where would you like to be dropped off today?<p class="message sent">Could you take me to Fitzroy street? I have a breakfast reservation there.<p class=message>Of course, Fitzroy it is. Do you have any plans for the day?<p class="message sent">Yes, after breakfast, I plan on walking around St. Kilda and enjoying the beach. Have you been there before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's a nice place to visit. Make sure to try some of the street food while you're there.<p class="message sent">Will do! So, do you drive for a living, or is this just a side job?<p class=message>Actually, I'm a part-time Uber driver. I'm also a student, so this helps me earn some extra cash.<p class="message sent">That's great. It must be a great way to meet new people too.<p class=message>It definitely is. I've met some interesting people through driving. What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?<p class="message sent">I work in marketing for a startup company. It can be quite hectic, but I enjoy it.<p class=message>That sounds exciting. I've always admired people who work in marketing. It must be fun coming up with creative ideas.<p class="message sent">Yes, it can be. But it can also be challenging trying to keep up with the competition.<p class=message>I can imagine. We're here at Fitzroy street. That will be $18.50. Enjoy your breakfast and your day!<p class="message sent">Thank you, I will. Keep up the good work, and have a great day too!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2c1f8378-ebf8-4ee7-9770-8ce84fbe463e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
