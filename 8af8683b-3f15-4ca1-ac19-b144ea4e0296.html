How's everything going?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing great, thanks for asking. I'm excited to see what you've come up with for our design project.<p class=message>I've been working hard on it, I hope you'll like it. So, I was thinking we could use some vibrant colors to make it really pop.<p class="message sent">Oh that sounds interesting, what colors do you have in mind?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of using shades of blue and green to give it a fresh and energetic feel.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect, I'm all about feeling fresh and energized! What about the font style?<p class=message>I found this awesome new font that I think will really make it stand out. It's called "Bubblegum Sans" and it's playful yet professional.<p class="message sent">I love it! It sounds like you've really put a lot of thought and effort into this. What kind of images do you want to use?<p class=message>I thought we could incorporate some nature-inspired images like trees and leaves to give it a natural and organic feel.<p class="message sent">Brilliant! I can't wait to see the finished product. When do you think it will be ready?<p class=message>I should be able to have it ready within the next week. Does that work for you?<p class="message sent">That would be perfect, thank you for all your hard work A.<p class=message>No problem at all, I always enjoy working on projects with you B. And remember, if you think of any new ideas or changes, feel free to let me know.<p class="message sent">Will do, thanks again A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8af7be36-5263-4ae1-a6d4-e8ed42ada53f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
