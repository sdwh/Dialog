How did your doctor's appointment go?<p class="message sent">Hi A! It went pretty well. I was diagnosed with a minor cold and the doctor prescribed some medication.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Who was your doctor?<p class="message sent">I saw Dr. Lee, he's a really kind and knowledgeable physician.<p class=message>Oh, I know Dr. Lee! He's been my doctor for years. He always has a great bedside manner and makes me feel comfortable during check-ups.<p class="message sent">Yes, he definitely had a way of making the diagnosis less intimidating. Although, I have to admit, I wasn't too thrilled when he told me to cut back on my spicy food.<p class=message>Really? That's the worst! I can't imagine life without my favorite spicy dishes.<p class="message sent">I know, right? I'll have to substitute with some non-spicy alternatives for now.<p class=message>I feel your pain, B. But hey, at least you can still enjoy some ice cream, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's true. And speaking of ice cream, Dr. Lee actually recommended that I eat some to soothe my sore throat.<p class=message>That sounds like the perfect cure! Did he recommend any specific flavor?<p class="message sent">He suggested I stick with the classic vanilla flavor, but I might have to sneak in a chocolate scoop too.<p class=message>Hey, a little indulgence never hurt anyone. Now, let's hope your cold clears up soon so we can celebrate with some spicy food and ice cream together!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, A. Thanks for the well-wishes!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=64f25efb-76d0-4bc1-8b00-9ef4db90dd21.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
