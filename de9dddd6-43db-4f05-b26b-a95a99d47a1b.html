Are you ready for take-off?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! But before we go, can you please explain the safety instructions?<p class=message>Of course! First off, make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened. In the unlikely event of turbulence, keep it fastened until it's safe to move.<p class="message sent">Got it. What about the oxygen mask?<p class=message>If the cabin pressure drops, the oxygen masks will automatically drop down from above. Secure your own mask first before assisting others.<p class="message sent">I see. And what if we need to evacuate the plane?<p class=message>There are emergency exits located throughout the cabin. Follow the illuminated path and slide down the inflatable slide towards safety.<p class="message sent">Thanks for letting me know. I feel more at ease now.<p class=message>No problem. Safety is our top priority. Do you have any other questions before we depart?<p class="message sent">Actually, I do have one more question. Do you have any funny flying stories to share?<p class=message>Oh, I once had a passenger who refused to turn off his mobile phone during take-off. We had to circle the airport until he finally turned it off.<p class="message sent">That's hilarious! Thanks for sharing that with me. I'll make sure to turn off my phone.<p class=message>You're welcome. Enjoy the flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=de9cf702-af5f-44a8-92b5-d3f7e5e69d8c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
