I can't believe we're shooting here at Kiyomizu-dera Temple.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's one of the most popular tourist spots in Kyoto. The temple is also designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.<p class=message>I read in my research that it's believed if you drink water from the Otowa waterfall, it will bring you luck in love, health, or school performance.<p class="message sent">That's right! There are three streams of water to choose from, but it's considered greedy to drink from all three. So, which one will you choose?<p class=message>Hmm, decisions decisions... I think I'll go with the water for love. Maybe it will bring me some luck on my next date.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Good choice! Let's head down to the next filming location by going through Higashiyama district, which is a preserved historic area.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard about that area! It has traditional wooden houses and shops selling souvenirs and snacks.<p class="message sent">You've done your research well! It's one of the best places to experience Japanese culture.<p class=message>By the way, have you tried any of the famous Kyoto sweets, like matcha-flavored treats or wagashi?<p class="message sent">Of course! My personal favorite is warabimochi, a jelly-like dessert made from bracken starch.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! I think I'll have to try that after we finish shooting.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And don't forget to try some green tea from one of the famous tea houses nearby.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation. I'm having such a great time exploring Kyoto with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise. And don't forget to share your experiences on your blog so others can discover the beauty of Kyoto too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dbfd8855-35c2-4dee-bdb5-4aca9b052434.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
