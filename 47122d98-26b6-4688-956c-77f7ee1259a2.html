How's it going tonight?<p class="message sent">Going just fine, A. How about you? Busy in the kitchen?<p class=message>Pretty busy, but I love it. Any interesting orders for me?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we have a vegan customer who wants a burger without meat, cheese or any animal products. Can you handle that?<p class=message>Of course! We have several vegan options. How about a vegan Beyond burger with some avocado, lettuce and tomato?<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. By the way, have you seen the new chef's knife I got today?<p class=message>No, let me see. Wow, that's a beautiful knife. It looks very sharp too.<p class="message sent">It's actually made of Damascus steel, so it's very durable and long-lasting.<p class=message>Nice. I think I might have to get one for myself.<p class="message sent">I can give you the website where I ordered it if you want.<p class=message>That would be great. By the way, I heard you went on a food tour in Asia last month. How was it?<p class="message sent">It was amazing. I tried so many different foods and got to learn some new techniques to bring back to our kitchen.<p class=message>I'm so envious. Which country had the best food in your opinion?<p class="message sent">It's hard to choose, but I would say Thailand. The flavors there were so bold and unique.<p class=message>I've always wanted to go to Thailand. Maybe one day we can plan a trip together.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. For now, let's focus on making our customers happy tonight.<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's get cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=470e3018-27d9-49a0-8326-4509ed074801.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
