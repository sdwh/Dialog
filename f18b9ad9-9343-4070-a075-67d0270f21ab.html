My name is Sarah and I’ll be your guide for today’s eco-tour.<p class="message sent">Hello Sarah, it’s nice to meet you. I’ve never been on an eco-tour before, so I’m excited to learn about the rainforest.<p class=message>Great to hear! Our first stop is at the ‘Canopy Tower,’ which will give us a 360-degree view of the surrounding forest. It’s just a short walk from here.<p class="message sent">Wow, it’s really beautiful up here! Look at all the green everywhere. How many different species of trees are there?<p class=message>Well, there are over 30,000 different plant species and over 400 types of trees in this area alone. Pretty amazing, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, it really is. What kind of wildlife can we expect to see?<p class=message>You might catch a glimpse of a cassowary, a rare and endangered bird, or maybe even a tree kangaroo. There are also plenty of insects, birds and reptiles to spot.<p class="message sent">Oh, that’s fascinating! I’ve never seen a tree kangaroo before. I hope we get to see one.<p class=message>Well, let’s keep our eyes peeled as we head down to the next stop. Look over there, do you see that bird with the bright red beak?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do! What kind of bird is that?<p class=message>That’s a Kookaburra, also known as the laughing kookaburra. It’s a type of kingfisher that’s native to Australia.<p class="message sent">The laughing kookaburra? I love that name! It does look like it’s laughing too.<p class=message>It sure does. Okay, we’ve reached the end of the tour. I hope you had a great time and learned a thing or two about the rainforest.<p class="message sent">I had an amazing time! Thank you so much for showing me around and sharing all of your knowledge.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f1877f89-2225-4484-9b05-b68562d7224c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
