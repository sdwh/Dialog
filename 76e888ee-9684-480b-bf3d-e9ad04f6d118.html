How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not bad, A. Just getting ready for the lunch rush.<p class=message>Yeah, it's always busy around this time. Have you tried our new enchiladas?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had the chance yet. Are they any good?<p class=message>Oh yeah, they're amazing! The sauce has a nice kick to it, but it's not too spicy.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. Maybe I'll have to try them for my lunch break.<p class=message>Definitely do! And while you're at it, make sure you grab some guac on the side.<p class="message sent">Yum! Guac is definitely one of my weaknesses. Speaking of which, have you seen the new kitchen gadget we got in?<p class=message>No, what is it?<p class="message sent">It's a guacamole masher! It makes preparing guac so much easier.<p class=message>Wow, I need to try that out. I'm always struggling to mash the avocados just right.<p class="message sent">Trust me, it's a game changer. So, any interesting customers come in lately?<p class=message>Actually, yes. We had a group of guys come in trying to prove they could handle our spiciest salsa. It was quite a show.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a challenge I'd be up for. How spicy are we talking?<p class=message>Let's just say they were sweating by the end of it. But they did finish the whole bowl, so I'll give them credit for that.<p class="message sent">Impressive! Hey, speaking of challenges, are you still planning on participating in the upcoming chili cook-off?<p class=message>Absolutely! I've been practicing my recipe for weeks now. Do you want to be on my team?<p class="message sent">I'd love to! I've been waiting for an opportunity to show off my cooking skills.<p class=message>Great, it's settled then! Together, we'll make the best chili this town has ever seen.<p class="message sent">I have no doubt about that. With our combined talents, we'll be unstoppable.<p class=message>Haha, that's the spirit! Alright, let's get back to work. Those enchiladas aren't going to sell themselves.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=76e7d8d3-bc08-4a5e-995e-3d82884eae6b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
