I'm from the immigration office. Could I see your passport, please?<p class="message sent">Sure, here it is. I just want to ask if there is any update about the entry requirements?<p class=message>Well, there have been some changes recently. You might want to check the government website for the latest updates.<p class="message sent">Thanks for letting me know. I'll definitely do that.<p class=message>Great. I also notice that you don't have a return ticket. Do you have plans to stay here for a long time?<p class="message sent">No, not really. I'm just waiting for my next flight schedule. Is that going to be a problem?<p class=message>It's not a problem, but I suggest that you book a return ticket before your arrival next time to avoid any inconvenience.<p class="message sent">That's very helpful. I'll keep that in mind.<p class=message>Now, let me stamp your passport with the arrival date. Welcome to our country!<p class="message sent">Thank you very much. By the way, do you have any recommendations for tourist spots and restaurants here?<p class=message>Of course, we have a lot of amazing spots to visit and delicious food to taste. Do you have any specific preference?<p class="message sent">I'm open to any suggestion. I want to try your local delicacies.<p class=message>Okay, you should try our national dish called adobo. It's made of chicken or pork, soy sauce, vinegar, and other spices. You should also visit our historical landmarks like Intramuros and the National Museum.<p class="message sent">Wow, thanks for the suggestions. You make me more excited to explore your country.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Enjoy your stay and feel free to ask me or any of my colleagues if you need any assistance.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks again for your help. Have a nice day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4a2923f2-9022-4829-b764-dce36c66ac3c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
