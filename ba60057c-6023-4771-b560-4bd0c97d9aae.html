How about you? How’s work going?<p class=message>Work’s been busy, but I’m glad we could grab lunch together. What looks good on the menu here?<p class="message sent">I’m not sure, everything looks delicious. Maybe we can split a few dishes.<p class=message>That’s a great idea. How about we start with some appetizers, like the fried calamari and bruschetta?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I’ve been craving calamari.<p class=message>And for our main course, do you want to try their famous burger or their seafood pasta?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I’m torn between those. Which one are you leaning towards?<p class=message>I think I’ll go for the burger, but we can also share the pasta if you want.<p class="message sent">Okay, let’s do that. Oh, and we can’t forget dessert! The tiramisu here is supposed to be amazing.<p class=message>Absolutely! I also saw they have a chocolate lava cake on the menu, so we might have to get both.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You know me too well.<p class=message>How’s work going for you lately? Are you still enjoying your job?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I am. It’s been a bit stressful, but I like the challenge. Plus, my co-workers are really supportive.<p class=message>That’s great to hear. I’m glad you found a job you enjoy.<p class="message sent">Thanks, sis. So, any plans for the weekend?<p class=message>Not really, just planning to relax and catch up on some Netflix shows. How about you?<p class="message sent">Same here, but I’m also thinking about going for a hike if the weather’s nice.<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea. I might join you if I’m feeling adventurous.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You’re always welcome to join me, sis.<p class=message>(smiling) Thanks, sis. I’m lucky to have you as my little sister.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ba5b7cde-880b-4cb7-b7c6-b0986d010c1c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
