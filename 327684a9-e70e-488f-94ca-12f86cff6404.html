How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I wanted to discuss some student affairs with you.<p class=message>Sure, I'm all ears. What seems to be the issue?<p class="message sent">Well, I've noticed that some students are struggling with time management and balancing their academics with extracurricular activities.<p class=message>Yes, that can be a common problem. We do offer some resources for time management and study skills. Have you directed them to those?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. But I was wondering if we could also offer some fun and interactive workshops for students to learn these skills.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can reach out to some organizations on campus to help us facilitate these workshops.<p class="message sent">That would be wonderful. I think it would be beneficial for the students to learn these skills in a hands-on way.<p class=message>Agreed. We can also highlight these workshops during orientation and other student events to make sure they get the exposure they deserve.<p class="message sent">That's a great plan. Thank you for your help, A.<p class=message>Of course, happy to assist you. Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class="message sent">No, that's it for now. But I appreciate your time and willingness to help.<p class=message>Anytime, Professor B. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=326de7d1-0436-41aa-bb09-8aab7f65fa28.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
