How about you?<p class=message>I'm a little nervous, this is my first time in Bangkok.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I've been driving taxis in Bangkok for over 10 years. You're in good hands.<p class=message>That's reassuring. So, have you always lived in Bangkok?<p class="message sent">Yes, born and raised. What about you? Where are you from?<p class=message>I'm from Tokyo, Japan. I came here for a vacation.<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that's interesting! What made you choose Bangkok?<p class=message>I've heard so many good things about the city, the food, and the nightlife.<p class="message sent">You'll definitely love the food here. Do you like spicy food?<p class=message>I do, but I'm not used to it being so hot. How much spiciness should I expect?<p class="message sent">Thai food can be really spicy, but it's always best to ask them to make it mild. You can always add spice later.<p class=message>Good to know. What do you like to do for fun in Bangkok?<p class="message sent">I love trying out new food places and hanging out with friends. Oh, and visiting the night markets is always a must.<p class=message>That sounds like fun. I hope I can check out some of those places.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Have you made any plans for where you want to go?<p class=message>I've heard that the Grand Palace is a must-see, and I want to ride a tuk-tuk.<p class="message sent">The Grand Palace is beautiful, and tuk-tuk rides are a fun experience. Just make sure to agree on a price before getting in.<p class=message>Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the tips!<p class="message sent">No problem. We're almost there! Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>No, that's all. Thank you for the great conversation and the safe ride.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Have a great time in Bangkok!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e84614f9-cfc0-4c26-9f4e-c4e7abf6e9b4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
