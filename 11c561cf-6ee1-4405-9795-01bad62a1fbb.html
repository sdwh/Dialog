I'm so pumped for tonight's concert!<p class="message sent">Hey A, it's good to see you too. I know, right? I've heard that the audience here is really energetic.<p class=message>Yeah, I've performed here a few times before and they always bring the house down. Speaking of which, have you listened to our latest album?<p class="message sent">Of course, I've been promoting it non-stop! It's been getting great reviews.<p class=message>That's awesome to hear! I'm really proud of the work we put into it.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Speaking of which, have you thought about what songs you want to perform tonight?<p class=message>Yeah, I've got a setlist ready. I want to start with our newest single to get the crowd hyped up.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. And I also think we should play one of our classics to keep our fans happy.<p class=message>Good call! I was thinking about playing "Love Song" as one of our encores.<p class="message sent">Perfect. And we should definitely end with a bang, maybe with "Fireworks" to leave the audience wanting more.<p class=message>Yes! I love ending on that song. It always gets everyone on their feet.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Alright, let's get ready to rock the stage! Oh, but before that, we should do a quick soundcheck.<p class=message>Right, let's go. I can't wait to hear how amazing we sound on this stage!<p class="message sent">Me too, A. Let's show Osaka what we're made of!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=11bf1f79-4d94-4da8-89e3-9c59529cfcd1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
