Working on any new games lately?<p class="message sent">Hey A! Actually, yes, we're in the middle of creating a new puzzle game. It's going to be different from anything we've done before.<p class=message>Really? That sounds exciting! Can you give me any hints about what the game is going to be like?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me see... It's going to involve rotating blocks to create a path for a character to follow. It's a bit like a maze, but with three-dimensional elements.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds pretty challenging. Are you designing it for casual players or more experienced gamers?<p class="message sent">We're aiming for a middle ground, really. We want it to be accessible to anyone who enjoys puzzle games, but with enough depth and complexity to keep more serious players engaged.<p class=message>Well, I'm definitely curious to try it out. Do you have any special features or power-ups planned?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. We're going to have a "rewind" feature that lets players undo their last few moves, as well as some special blocks that can change the properties of the other blocks around them.<p class=message>Cool! I can already tell this is going to be addictive. When do you think it'll be available to play?<p class="message sent">We're hoping to release it in a few months, but we want to make sure it's as polished and bug-free as possible before we put it out there.<p class=message>That's understandable. Speaking of bugs, have you had any really weird glitches or problems during development?<p class="message sent">Oh, plenty. I once accidentally made all the characters in the game shrink down to the size of ants. It was pretty hilarious, but also a huge pain to fix.<p class=message>Haha, I can imagine. Well, thanks for giving me a sneak peek of the new game. I can't wait to give it a try!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=abb77ff9-f214-439b-8cd3-5253cd418459.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
