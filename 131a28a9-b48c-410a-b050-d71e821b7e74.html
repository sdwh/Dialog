Are you ready for some laugh-out-loud entertainment tonight? I sure am!<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! And speaking of laughter, did you hear about the guy who invented Lifesavers? He made a mint!<p class=message>(laughs) That's a good one! And speaking of food, I’ve been trying to cut down my portion size. I’d like to eat more salads, but I’m afraid they’ll leave me feeling empty inside.<p class="message sent">Hey, I get you! Did you hear about the Italian chef that died? He pasta way.<p class=message>(rolling with laughter) You're killing me! And speaking of death, did you hear about the movie called "Constipation"? It hasn't come out yet!<p class="message sent">(laughing) Wow, that's meta! But speaking of movies, why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!<p class=message>(chuckles) You're on a roll tonight! And speaking of dressing, why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!<p class="message sent">(cracks up) I love that one! And speaking of science, did you know that 97% of the DNA in humans is the same as in chimpanzees? So basically, we’re just one banana peel away from being complete monkeys!<p class=message>(laughs so hard that he can’t breathe) Stop it! You're killing me! Speaking of monkeys, why did the monkey take a bath? Because it was a dirty little monkey!<p class="message sent">(laughing uncontrollably) Oh man, these jokes are bananas! Speaking of baths, did you hear about the new restaurant called Karma? There’s no menu, you just get what you deserve.<p class=message>(wiping tears from his eyes) That's hilarious! You are too much! Speaking of restaurants, why can't a bicycle stand up by itself? Because it's two-tired!<p class="message sent">(clapping his hands and hooting with laughter) Oh man, you are on fire tonight! Speaking of fire, why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was out-standing in his field!<p class=message>(smiling) Alright, folks, that's our show for tonight! Thank you all so much for coming out and having a good time. Remember, laughter is the best medicine, and we hope you leave here with your spirits lifted! Good night!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=131a0e78-e5fd-4948-b3d8-dac1b94d9ea9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
