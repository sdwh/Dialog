What kind of tea would you like to try today?<p class="message sent">Hello, I'm feeling like green tea. What do you recommend?<p class=message>You should try our Dragonwell tea, it's really popular, and it pairs well with our Almond Puff pastries.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. How do you make those pastries?<p class=message>Oh, they are made with flaky puff pastry and filled with creamy almond paste, then baked until golden brown. Would you like to watch me make them?<p class="message sent">Sure, that would be great! I'll start brewing the tea in the meantime.<p class=message>Alright, I have to roll out the puff pastry first. It's a little bit tricky to get it just right, but practice makes perfect.<p class="message sent">The tea leaves are starting to unfurl now. It smells amazing.<p class=message>The puff pastry dough needs to be kept cold, but not too cold, or it will be too difficult to work with. I'll take it out of the fridge again soon.<p class="message sent">How do you decide how long to brew the tea for?<p class=message>It depends on the type of tea, and personal preference. Dragonwell is best brewed for around two minutes. But it also depends on how strong or weak you like your tea.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Oh, those pastries are looking so delicious!<p class=message>They need to cool a little bit before we put the filling inside. In the meantime, can I offer you any other teas?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'd love to try some osmanthus oolong tea as well.<p class=message>Of course, that's a great choice. Here you go. *pouring hot water*<p class="message sent">Mmm, this is also really good. I'm so glad I came here today.<p class=message>Thank you! That's always great to hear. The filling is ready now, so I'll put it into the pastries and we can pop them back into the oven.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to try them. And I think I'll have to take some tea leaves home with me as well.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We have a variety of teas available for purchase.<p class="message sent">Thank you for everything. It's been a delightful afternoon.<p class=message>You're welcome. It was my pleasure to share the experience of tea and pastry-making with you. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1648c77f-5c03-4822-98e5-f26bcb87a11d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
