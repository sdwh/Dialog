I heard you're designing a new RPG game.<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! It's going to be epic. What do you think makes a great RPG game?<p class=message>Well, for me, it's all about the character development and storyline. I want to feel like I'm really part of the game.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We're putting a lot of emphasis on the story, and we're also creating some really unique and customizable characters.<p class=message>That sounds awesome. What kind of world are you creating for us to explore?<p class="message sent">It's a mystical land, full of magic and creatures. We want players to get lost in the world and feel like they're discovering something new at every turn.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. But what about combat? Any new features or mechanics we can look forward to?<p class="message sent">We're working on a new active combat system that will require players to strategize and think on their toes. It's going to be challenging, but also really rewarding.<p class=message>Sounds like you're putting a lot of effort into this game. When can we expect it to be released?<p class="message sent">We're aiming for a fall release, but we want to make sure everything's perfect before we launch. We don't want to rush it.<p class=message>I hear you. I'm looking forward to it. Do you need any beta testers?<p class="message sent">Actually, we will be running a beta soon. I'll keep you in mind for the testing group.<p class=message>Sweet! Sign me up. I'm excited for this game.<p class="message sent">Glad to hear it. We'll keep you posted as we make progress. Thanks for your support!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=40bb1401-3cdc-4380-b0c8-830568c7b04c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
