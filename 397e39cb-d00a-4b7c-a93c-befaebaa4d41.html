I've had a headache for days now.<p class=message>I'm sorry to hear that. Let's take a look and see what we can do for you. Have you taken any painkillers?<p class="message sent">Yeah, but they don't seem to be doing anything.<p class=message>Alright, I'm going to examine your head and take your temperature. Have you been drinking enough water lately?<p class="message sent">Honestly, probably not. I've been really busy with work.<p class=message>Well, dehydration can cause headaches too. I recommend drinking more water and taking frequent breaks if possible. And I'll prescribe you a stronger painkiller for relief.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I appreciate it. I'm really hoping to get back to work soon.<p class=message>Of course. But don't push yourself too much. It's important to prioritize your health.<p class="message sent">I know, it's just hard when there's so much to do.<p class=message>I understand. But remember, taking care of yourself is the first step towards being productive. And who knows, maybe a little rest will help you come up with some fresh ideas for work.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Thanks for being so reassuring, doc.<p class=message>No problem, it's my pleasure. Let's get you feeling better soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=397dadd8-a2c7-4fb8-b3bb-3f824aa444c3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
