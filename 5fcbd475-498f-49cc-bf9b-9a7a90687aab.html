How long have you been a taxi driver in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Oh, hi. I have been driving a taxi for 7 years now. I know Tokyo like the back of my hand.<p class=message>That's great! Do you have a favorite place to go in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love going to Shibuya to people-watch. It's always so lively and entertaining.<p class=message>I've never been there. What's it like?<p class="message sent">It's a bustling neighborhood with lots of shops, coffee houses, and restaurants. It's a great place to take a walk and explore.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. Are there any hidden gems in Tokyo worth seeing as well?<p class="message sent">Definitely! If you like quiet spaces, I suggest visiting the Meiji Shrine. It's a peaceful oasis in the midst of the city.<p class=message>That sounds like a great recommendation! By the way, how long will it take us to get to our destination?<p class="message sent">We should arrive in about 30 minutes if traffic stays clear.<p class=message>That's perfect! Would you mind turning up the music a bit? I'm in the mood for some upbeat tunes.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! I have some great Japanese pop music that you might enjoy.<p class=message>Awesome! Could you also recommend some Japanese snacks that I should try while I'm here in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Of course! I highly recommend trying some mochi, takoyaki, and senbei. They're all delicious.<p class=message>Thank you for the suggestions! You really do know Tokyo well.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. Enjoy your stay in Tokyo and let me know if you need any more recommendations!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5fc59842-75fc-46f8-bd30-c2ac2747d2d1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
