Can you help me?<p class="message sent">Of course, I would be happy to assist you with that. Can you please provide me with some details about your lost luggage?<p class=message>Sure, it's a black suitcase with a yellow stripe on it. It's a medium-sized one.<p class="message sent">Alright. Can you also give me your flight number and any other identification marks on the luggage?<p class=message>The flight number is 307 and there's a small sticker with my name on it.<p class="message sent">Great. I will file a report on this and we will search for your luggage. Don't worry, we'll make sure it gets back to you.<p class=message>Thank you so much! I was really worried about it.<p class="message sent">No problem, it's all part of the job. By the way, have you tried any of our airport food? I hear the pizza is really good.<p class=message>Oh, I haven't had a chance to do that yet. Is it better than the burger place?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough one. I would say they are both delicious in their own way. Why not try both and decide for yourself?<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. I'll do that while we wait for my luggage.<p class="message sent">Perfect. And if you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to let me know.<p class=message>Sure, thanks again for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dd3a4ba1-9518-45e2-aa7e-1a3d4872bb24.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
