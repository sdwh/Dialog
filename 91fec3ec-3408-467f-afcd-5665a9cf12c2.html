Where are you headed today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I need to go to the city center. Can you take me there?<p class=message>Sure thing! Hop in and let's get going. What brings you to Perth?<p class="message sent">Just some sightseeing and spending time with friends. What do you recommend I see while I'm here?<p class=message>Oh, there are so many things! Kings Park is a must-visit, and the beaches are beautiful too. Have you tried fish and chips yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but it's on my list! What's your favorite spot for it?<p class=message>I'm a big fan of Cicerello's at Fremantle. Their servings are huge and the fish is always fresh.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! By the way, I noticed your accent - where are you from?<p class=message>I'm originally from Ireland, but I've been living in Perth for 10 years now. What about you?<p class="message sent">I'm from Japan. It's my first time in Australia, and so far I'm loving it.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Did you have to adjust to the change in weather?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's definitely a lot warmer here than Japan. But I love the sunshine and the blue skies!<p class=message>Me too! Speaking of which, we're here at the city center. Is there anything else I can help you with today?<p class="message sent">No, that's all. Thank you so much for the ride and the recommendations! Have a great day.<p class=message>You too! Enjoy your time in Perth.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=91fe5cb3-2bfa-4632-bd31-826287bebff1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
