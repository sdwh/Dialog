Our hotel just installed new facilities for guests with disabilities!<p class="message sent">That's great news! So, what kind of facilities did they add?<p class=message>Well, they've got wider doors, wheelchair-accessible ramps, and braille signs in the elevators.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's really thoughtful. It's important for everyone to feel welcome and comfortable.<p class=message>Absolutely! And, they've been training their staff to provide better service to guests with disabilities too.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic! What kind of training did they receive?<p class=message>They learned sign language and how to properly assist guests with mobility issues.<p class="message sent">That's really impressive. I hope more hotels follow their lead.<p class=message>Me too! Did you hear about the accessible room they added as well?<p class="message sent">No, tell me more!<p class=message>It's specially designed with grab bars, a lowered bed, and an accessible bathroom.<p class="message sent">That's so thoughtful. People with disabilities deserve to have comfortable accommodations too.<p class=message>I completely agree. Plus, the hotel is also offering special rates for guests with disabilities.<p class="message sent">That's even better! It's good to know they're not just doing it for show.<p class=message>Exactly! And, they're planning on adding even more accessible features in the future.<p class="message sent">I'm amazed. It feels so great to see businesses actually caring about the needs of all their customers.<p class=message>It definitely does.

It sounds like a fantastic place to stay.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=84c990b1-4684-4371-9238-1a60b38b3b0a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
