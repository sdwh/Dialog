Did you sleep well last night?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did surprisingly. The bed is more comfortable than I expected.<p class=message>That's always a plus. Have you been enjoying the food here?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have! I didn't expect hospital food to be so tasty.<p class=message>Our kitchen staff works hard to make sure our patients enjoy their meals. So, do you have any plans for the day?<p class="message sent">Just some physical therapy and resting. How about you?<p class=message>Oh, just the usual. Administering medications, taking vitals, and charting.<p class="message sent">Sounds like fun.<p class=message>(laughs) It's not the most exciting job in the world, but it's definitely rewarding.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. You're all doing such important work here. Speaking of which, you seem a little stressed today. Is everything okay?<p class=message>(sighs) It's just been a busy day so far. But seeing you feeling better makes it all worth it.<p class="message sent">Well, I appreciate all your hard work. You and the rest of the staff have been amazing.<p class=message>Thank you so much for saying that. We love seeing our patients get better and go home healthy.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to get back to my normal routine. But until then, you guys are stuck with me.<p class=message>We don't mind at all. Take all the time you need. We're here to help you get back on your feet.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6d614a5f-b2c9-409c-8e7c-4434610a33c9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
