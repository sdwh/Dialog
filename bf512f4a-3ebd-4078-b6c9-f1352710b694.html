How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm doing well. Just excited for the concert!<p class=message>Great to hear that! May I please see your bag? We need to check it for safety reasons.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, go ahead.<p class=message>Hmm, is this a water bottle I'm seeing? It's not allowed inside the venue, unfortunately.<p class="message sent">Oh, shoot. Thanks for letting me know. I'll just finish it before we head in.<p class=message>No problem at all. Safety is our top priority here. By the way, who are you most excited to see tonight?<p class="message sent">Definitely the headliner, they're my favorite band.<p class=message>That's awesome! I hope you enjoy their performance. Remember to stay safe and hydrated throughout the night.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much, I will. And thanks for your hard work as a security guard tonight.<p class=message>You're welcome, it's all part of the job. Plus, it's great to see everyone having a good time. Has anyone ever mistaken you for a famous singer before?<p class="message sent">Haha, no not yet. But that would be quite the experience!<p class=message>It definitely would be. Just remember, the real stars tonight are the musicians on stage. Have a great time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bf5075c4-0c6a-42f2-84ca-201a1cf05db9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
