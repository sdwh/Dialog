How's it going?<p class="message sent">Good, thanks! I just finished implementing the login feature for the game website.<p class=message>Great job! I've been working on the layout design and I think it's coming along nicely.<p class="message sent">That's awesome! Are there any specific features you want me to work on next?<p class=message>Yes, I was thinking we could add a leaderboard feature so players can see who's on top.<p class="message sent">Sounds good! Do you have a preference for how the leaderboard should look?<p class=message>Hmm, how about a simple table layout with columns for player name, score, and ranking?<p class="message sent">Got it. And how about we add some fun animations when a player makes it onto the leaderboard?<p class=message>Yes, that would be awesome! Speaking of animations, have you seen any cool ones we could use for the game itself?<p class="message sent">I found this one of an exploding banana that could work for a special power-up.<p class=message>(laughs) An exploding banana? I like it! Let's definitely add that in.<p class="message sent">And do you have any thoughts on how we should handle user feedback and bug reports?<p class=message>We could create a contact form that sends an email to our support team. And speaking of support, do you know of any good chatbot tools we could use for customer service?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have experience with Dialogueflow and it's user-friendly. Want me to set that up?<p class=message>That would be great, thanks! And I'll work on adding in some social media integration so players can share their high scores.<p class="message sent">Perfect. We make a great team!<p class=message>Definitely. And once we launch the site, we should celebrate with a game night and invite all our friends to try it out.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! I can't wait to see the finished product.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9c350210-0b7c-4d4e-9a9c-e52b91e51de7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
