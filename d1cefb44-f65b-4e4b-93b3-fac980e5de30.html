Just a bit tired and sore.<p class=message>That's to be expected, but we'll make sure you're comfortable.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I appreciate it. How long do you think I'll be here for?<p class=message>It depends on how well you respond to treatment, but we'll keep you updated.<p class="message sent">I hope it's not too long, I don't like being cooped up in here.<p class=message>I understand, but we need to make sure you're fully recovered before you leave.<p class="message sent">I guess that makes sense. Can I at least have some TV to watch?<p class=message>Of course, we have cable TV in each room for our patients to enjoy.<p class="message sent">Great, that will help pass the time. Any good shows you recommend?<p class=message>Hmm, well I personally enjoy watching cooking shows. Have you seen 'MasterChef'?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love that show! It always makes me hungry though.<p class=message>Ha, I know the feeling. How about 'The Great British Bake Off'? It's a lot of fun too.<p class="message sent">I haven't seen that one yet, but I'll definitely give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class=message>No problem, anything to help make your stay here a little more pleasant.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d1cef093-f7bc-4ebb-80ba-5dd56af4d149.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
