Have you seen the results of the source code analysis report?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm good! Yeah, I did. I must say I wasn't expecting so many issues to be uncovered.<p class=message>Yeah, it happens sometimes. But don't worry, we'll get through this. Did you manage to replicate any of the issues found?<p class="message sent">Yes, some of them were pretty straightforward. It's interesting how even a small change in code can cause so many vulnerabilities.<p class=message>I know, right? That's why source code analysis is so essential. So, what's your plan for fixing the issues?<p class="message sent">First, I'm going to prioritize the high-risk issues and work on them. Then, I'll move on to the lower-risk ones.<p class=message>Great idea. And if you need any help, just let me know. I have experience with vulnerability remediation.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! That's good to know. Say, have you seen the latest memes about source code analysis?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What are they?<p class="message sent">There's one that says "When you finally fix all the vulnerabilities found in the source code analysis report" and it shows a character from a game standing on a mountain, victorious.<p class=message>Haha, that's hilarious! We should share it with the rest of the team.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's a nice way to lighten the mood during this process.<p class=message>Speaking of lightening the mood, did you hear the one about the developer who discovered a bug?<p class="message sent">No, what is it?<p class=message>He said "I just found a bug in my favorite software. I was installing it and it said 'Error 404 - Brain not found'"<p class="message sent">Haha, that's funny! I'll have to remember that one.<p class=message>Alright, let's get back to work. We've got some vulnerabilities to fix!<p class="message sent">Sure thing, A. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9843cb8a-a417-4cd5-a15a-4a52e1e5b9f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
