How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon, ma'am. I've been driving taxis for almost ten years now.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive! Have you ever had any interesting experiences while driving?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I remember once I had a passenger who was in such a rush to make it to the airport that he forgot his luggage in my car!<p class=message>Oh no! Did he call you back to retrieve it?<p class="message sent">Yes, he did. He was quite apologetic and even gave me a big tip for returning it.<p class=message>That's a happy ending! So, what do you like to do when you're not working?<p class="message sent">I'm actually a big fan of karaoke. I love singing all sorts of songs, especially from the 80s and 90s.<p class=message>That sounds like fun! Do you have a favorite song to sing?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely "Livin' On a Prayer" by Bon Jovi. It always gets everyone singing along.<p class=message>I agree, that's a classic. By the way, have you ever been to Shenzhen before?<p class="message sent">Yes, many times. It's a bustling city with lots to see and do, especially when it comes to shopping and cuisine.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm actually going there to attend a friend's wedding.<p class="message sent">Well, congratulations to your friend! I hope you have a wonderful time at the wedding and enjoy your stay in Shenzhen.<p class=message>Thank you so much! I'm really looking forward to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=13393384-5c0b-4aeb-872b-30e210212d9f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
