It looks like we both have the same idea about coming to the market in Zhuhai, looking for some fresh seafood.<p class="message sent">Yes! I am a fishmonger actually, and I came all the way from Hong Kong to get my hands on the best quality seafood.<p class=message>Well, I'm a farmer, and I too am looking to get some of the best produce. Hey, are those giant lobsters? They look amazing!<p class="message sent">Yes, they are! Lobsters are a popular item for me, especially for the VIPs in Hong Kong. Would you like to try one?<p class=message>Ah, I'm not sure it fits my budget. But, have you tried the oysters here? They say they're the best in the market.<p class="message sent">Of course I have. I buy oysters from here all the time. In fact, I could give you some cooking tips if you like!<p class=message>That would be fantastic! I've never cooked oysters before, so I'm excited to try.<p class="message sent">Alright, so first things first, always make sure your oysters are fresh. Then, you can try grilling them or making some delicious oyster stew.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. I never thought of that. But, how do you distinguish the freshness of the oysters?<p class="message sent">One way is to check the color of the oyster meat. It should be a light grayish color instead of a darker color. Plus, if the oyster shell is not tightly closed, it's probably not fresh.<p class=message>Oh really? That's good to know. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the tips!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. That's what I'm here for â€“ to help fellow foodies. So, what else are you looking for?<p class=message>Well, I'm thinking of getting some fish as well. But, I'm not sure which kind to get.<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about the grouper fish? It's a popular fish item here, and it's quite versatile. You can grill it, fry it, or even make a nice fish soup.<p class=message>You know what? I think I'll take your advice on that. The grouper does look great. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! It's always great to meet someone who loves food as much as I do. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=128ee0f4-89ae-41e8-b355-11fc851a74e8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
