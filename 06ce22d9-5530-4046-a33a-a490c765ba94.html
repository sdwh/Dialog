We have to make sure that our company complies with them.<p class=message>Yeah, and we also have to keep them up-to-date, otherwise we could face some problems.<p class="message sent">Definitely. But it's not always easy to stay on top of all the updates.<p class=message>I know what you mean. I've been trying to come up with a better way to manage it all.<p class="message sent">Have you tried using some sort of software or tool to help with the updates?<p class=message>Actually, I have. But I found that it didn't really work for our team.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a shame. Have you tried talking to the other departments to see how they manage their policies and procedures?<p class=message>That's a good idea. We could learn from their experiences and find a solution that works for everyone.<p class="message sent">Exactly. We don't have to reinvent the wheel here.<p class=message>And we should also make sure that everyone is trained properly on the policies and procedures, so there are no misunderstandings.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. And we should also have regular checks to make sure that we are still in compliance with the ISO 27001 standards.<p class=message>Right. It's not enough to just have the policies and procedures in place. We have to actually follow them and make sure that we are doing things correctly.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And if we do run into any issues, we should be prepared to handle them quickly and efficiently.<p class=message>Yes, that's a good point. We need to have contingency plans in place.<p class="message sent">It seems like we have a lot of work to do, but I'm confident that we can handle it.<p class=message>Me too! It's all about working together and finding the best solutions for our team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=06cae98f-24dc-45ad-9e77-8ac09ec2e9c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
