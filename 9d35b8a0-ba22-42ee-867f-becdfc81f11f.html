How's life treating you?<p class="message sent">Can't complain, A. Just enjoying some sun and sand. So, what's the big news you wanted to share regarding your novel?<p class=message>Well, after writing and editing for weeks, I think I have finally come up with a good plot for my book. I was hoping to get your opinion on it.<p class="message sent">Of course, shoot.<p class=message>The story revolves around a young girl who is a spy and has to save the world from an evil scientist. How does that sound?<p class="message sent">Hmm, sounds interesting. But what sets it apart from other spy stories?<p class=message>I was thinking of giving a gender twist and making the protagonist a girl. Also, adding some humor and witty dialogues to make it light-hearted.<p class="message sent">Now that's clever. Adding humor to a spy story can be a game-changer. What about the publishing plan?<p class=message>I want to reach a wider audience, so I was thinking of going for an e-book format. And once it garners enough attention, we can go for print too.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good plan. Let's get started on the editing process, and we can take it from there.<p class=message>Perfect. And if all goes well, we can celebrate the release of the book at this very beach.<p class="message sent">I like your way of thinking, A. Let's hope the tide turns in our favor.<p class=message>I have a good feeling about this one, B. And with your expertise, I am sure we can make the book a hit.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit, A. Now let's soak up some sun and enjoy the rest of the day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9d34344b-95a9-4b8f-b083-c036c936c8b3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
