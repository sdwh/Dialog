I can't believe how fast time flies.<p class="message sent">Thank you, dad! I'm excited to celebrate with you today.<p class=message>Did you have any special requests for your birthday dinner?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I was thinking maybe some sushi or Thai food?<p class=message>Sushi it is! I know a great spot nearby that serves the freshest fish.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds perfect! So, how was your day at work today?<p class=message>Oh, you know, just the usual. Meetings, emails, and paperwork. But nothing compares to celebrating your special day with you.<p class="message sent">Aww, that's so sweet of you to say. Speaking of work, have you heard back about that promotion yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed. Hopefully, good news will come soon.<p class="message sent">I'm sure it will! Hey, do you remember when I used to want to be a ninja when I grew up?<p class=message>Of course, I do! You would always be running around the house, pretending to fight like a ninja.<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah. I'm sure you were happy when I moved on from that phase.<p class=message>To be honest, I kind of miss it. It was never a dull day with you around.<p class="message sent">Well, I can still show off some of my ninja moves if you want. But maybe not in the middle of the restaurant.<p class=message>Haha, let's save that for when we get home.<p class="message sent">Deal! So, have you made any birthday wishes yet?<p class=message>Just one. To see you happy and successful in all your future endeavors.<p class="message sent">You're the best, dad. I couldn't ask for a better birthday present than having you as my dad.<p class=message>That's the best present I could ever receive. Cheers to another year of love and laughter together.<p class="message sent">Cheers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ef66040f-a05b-4b60-800b-b139aa36c8cc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
