That's a common mistake, don't worry. We can definitely help you with that.<p class=message>That's great to hear, thank you. I also need to change my destination to a different city, is that possible?<p class="message sent">Yes, we offer a service called "change of destination." Did you have a new city in mind?<p class=message>Yes, I'll be heading to London instead of Paris. How much will it cost?<p class="message sent">Let me check for you. It will cost an additional 100 dollars for the change of destination fee, and any difference in the ticket price.<p class=message>Okay, that's not too bad. Can I also change my flight time?<p class="message sent">We do have a fee for changing flight times. It starts at 75 dollars, depending on your original flight and the new flight you want.<p class=message>Hmm, I think I'll just stick with the original flight time then.<p class="message sent">No problem, I'll process your refund and change of destination request now. Can I have your booking reference number please?<p class=message>Sure, it's XYZ123.<p class="message sent">Great, just give me a few minutes to process everything and you'll receive a confirmation email with your new ticket details.<p class=message>Fantastic, thank you so much for your help.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, happy travels! And double check those dates next time!
