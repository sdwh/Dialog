How can I assist you with your legal matter?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm here to discuss my contract with my employer.<p class=message>Alright, let's take a look. First, can you tell me the nature of your job?<p class="message sent">I work as a clown for a circus company.<p class=message>(chuckles) Well, that's certainly different. What seems to be the issue with your contract?<p class="message sent">I feel like I'm being underpaid and overworked.<p class=message>Hmm, let's see. As a clown, do you have any special skills or talents that were not reflected in your initial contract?<p class="message sent">Yes, I can juggle chainsaws and do balloon twisting.<p class=message>(jokingly) Wow, that's quite the combination! Alright, I'll make sure to negotiate a fair compensation for your added skills.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. On another note, do you have any good lawyer jokes to lighten the mood?<p class=message>Sure thing. Did you hear about the lawyer who tried to sue a shark for biting his client?<p class="message sent">No, what happened?<p class=message>The judge threw out the case, ruling that the shark was not a resident of the state and therefore had no jurisdiction.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's a good one! Thanks for the laugh, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Now, let's get down to business and make sure your rights as a clown are properly protected.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b6f53e9f-5d42-4e74-8bf9-bc074e1c59d3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
