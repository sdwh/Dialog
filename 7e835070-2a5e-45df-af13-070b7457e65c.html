Are you having a good day so far?<p class="message sent">Hello! Yes, thank you. How about you, Mr. Chef?<p class=message>I'm fine too, thanks for asking. What would you like to try from our menu tonight?<p class="message sent">Our specials tonight include bulgogi and bibimbap, would you like to try them?<p class="message sent">Great choice! We'll get that prepared for you right away.<p class=message>(to B) Can you help me with the preparation of the bulgogi?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Do you need me to slice the beef?<p class=message>Yes please, and can you also bring me the marinated vegetables from the fridge?<p class="message sent">Got it. By the way, have you heard about the Korean TV series that's been trending recently?<p class=message>What TV series?<p class="message sent">It's called "Crash Landing on You" and it's about a South Korean businesswoman who accidentally lands in North Korea and falls in love with a North Korean army officer.<p class=message>Oh wow, that sounds interesting. Have you watched it yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, and it's really good. I highly recommend it.<p class=message>I'll definitely check it out. (to guest) Your bulgogi and bibimbap are ready, please enjoy your meal!<p class="message sent">(to A) Hey Chef, I have an idea. Why don't we add a new dish to our menu inspired by that TV series?<p class=message>Hmm, that's actually a good idea. We can make a North Korean-style stew with some South Korean ingredients.<p class="message sent">Yes! We can call it the "Crash Landing Stew".<p class=message>(laughs) I like it! Let's work on the recipe tomorrow.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. By the way, did you hear about the new dessert shop that just opened across the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What kind of desserts do they offer?<p class="message sent">They specialize in shaved ice with different fruit toppings. We should try it after work.<p class=message>That sounds refreshing, I'm in!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7e81cfa8-628c-4f7f-b349-57394c4ed44b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
