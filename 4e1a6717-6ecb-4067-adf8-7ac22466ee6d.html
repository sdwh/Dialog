Welcome to the beautiful Avalon Peninsula. My name is Alex and I will be your guide today. Are you excited for the tour?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Alex. Yes, I am very excited. I've heard so much about this place.<p class=message>Great to hear! Avalon is a wonderful place with many historic sites, scenic trails, and terrific seafood. Have you tried fish & chips yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But I love seafood, especially lobster.<p class=message>You're going to love it here then. We have some of the best seafood in the world, and lobster is one of our specialties. Let me show you some of the local restaurants later.<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic. By the way, what's that hill over there with the funny name?<p class=message>Oh, you mean 'Jellybean Row'? That's a steep street with colorful houses painted in bright shades of pink, yellow, blue, and green. It's a popular spot for photos.<p class="message sent">Wow, those colors are so vibrant. Are they real jellybeans?<p class=message>Ha, nope. They're just houses with creative paint jobs. But it does look like a giant candy jar, doesn't it?<p class="message sent">It sure does. I'm already feeling like a kid in a candy store. Can we go up there?<p class=message>Absolutely. It's a bit of a hike, but the view from the top is worth it. Just follow me and we'll get there in no time.<p class="message sent">Alright, lead the way, Alex. Thanks for being such a helpful assistant.<p class=message>My pleasure, B. Let's enjoy the journey together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e19c71c-967b-4bce-8847-0d02a155825d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
