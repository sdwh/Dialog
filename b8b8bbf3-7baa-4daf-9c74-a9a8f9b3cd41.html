What do we have on the menu for tonight's five-course meal?<p class="message sent">Bonsoir, A! We'll start with a refreshing tomato consommé, followed by a poached lobster salad with avocado and grapefruit.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! For the main course?<p class="message sent">We have seared duck breast with fig compote and a side of ratatouille. And for dessert, a classic crème brûlée.<p class=message>Yum, my mouth is already watering. Shall we pair these dishes with a light red wine?<p class="message sent">Excellent idea! I recommend a Pinot Noir from Burgundy to complement the flavors.<p class=message>Great, I'll make sure to suggest it to our guests. By the way, did you catch the game last night?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! What a nail-biter. I thought the home team was going to lose, but they managed to pull through in the end.<p class=message>It was a wild game for sure. I'm glad they won, otherwise I would have lost my bet with the bartender.<p class="message sent">Ha! You always have such interesting bets with him. What's the forfeit this time?<p class=message>He challenged me to recite the entire menu backwards if I lost. But thanks to last night's win, I don't have to embarrass myself tonight.<p class="message sent">I'm sure you would have aced it, A. By the way, did you try the new cheese we got in yesterday?<p class=message>No, I haven't had a chance yet. Is it good?<p class="message sent">It's divine, you have to try it. Let me know what you think.<p class=message>Will do! Thanks, Chef. I can't wait for tonight's service.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. Let's show these diners what French cuisine is all about!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b8b1ecb2-446d-42be-a8fc-a2a058295c24.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
