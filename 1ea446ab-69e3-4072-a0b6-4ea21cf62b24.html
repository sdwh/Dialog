Which one are you talking about?<p class=message>It's a Chateau Margaux from 2010. I think it will pair perfectly with our braised duck dish.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! I'll go try it right away.<p class=message>By the way, we have a special tonight. Pan-seared scallops with truffle risotto.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love scallops! And with truffle risotto? You're making my taste buds dance.<p class=message>(laughs) That's what we aim for! So, how are things going with the customers tonight?<p class="message sent">Everyone seems really happy with their meals. We've had some great feedback so far.<p class=message>That's great to hear. The team has been working really hard to make sure every dish is top-notch.<p class="message sent">Speaking of the team, that new sous chef is doing a fantastic job. What's your secret for finding such amazing talent?<p class=message>(smiling) I have a nose for great chefs. Plus, I think working in this neighborhood attracts a certain type of culinary talent.<p class="message sent">(nodding) That makes sense. Parisians know good food when they taste it.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we strive to make sure every guest experiences the highest quality of French cuisine.<p class="message sent">I think it's safe to say we're doing a pretty good job.<p class=message>(laughs) Let's not let it go to our heads. But yes, we'll keep up the great work.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Cheers to that!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1ea3be0d-846c-472b-a816-cf1f1931b6ef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
