I'm getting so much inspiration just from browsing the shelves.<p class="message sent">I know right! The literary scene here in Japan is really thriving. Have you found any particular books that caught your eye?<p class=message>Actually, I picked up this novel by Haruki Murakami. Have you read anything by him?<p class="message sent">Yes! His writing is really unique and interesting. I recommend "Norwegian Wood" if you're looking for a good starting point.<p class=message>Thanks for the suggestion. What about you, have you found any good translations lately?<p class="message sent">I recently picked up "The Travelling Cat Chronicles" by Hiro Arikawa. It's a heartwarming story about a cat's journey and the people he meets along the way.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. I've always been interested in Japanese literature's depiction of animals. I heard they have a deep appreciation for nature.<p class="message sent">Yes, I noticed that too. It's very different from Western literature where animals are often anthropomorphized. Here, they seem to have their own spirit and personality.<p class=message>That's so interesting. I'm definitely going to keep that in mind as I continue exploring. Say, have you tried any local snacks or drinks in the area?<p class="message sent">Yes, the matcha flavored snacks are a must-try here! And don't get me started on sake. Have you had any yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm definitely excited to try it. I'm definitely feeling more immersed in the culture by taking in its literature and indulging in local delicacies.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Exploring different aspects of a culture is the best way to truly understand it. Let's continue our journey and see where it takes us next.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=015105f0-02c3-4ad6-9395-e2cb0afce852.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
