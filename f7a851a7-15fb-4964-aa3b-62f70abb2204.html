Thanks for picking me up. Do you live in the city?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. I've been driving a taxi here for five years.<p class=message>Wow, that's a long time. Do you have any favorite spots in the city?<p class="message sent">Sure, I really like going to the zoo. It's always fun to see the pandas.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard about that. Maybe I'll check it out while I'm here. Have you ever seen any other interesting animals there?<p class="message sent">Yeah, there are lots of exotic birds and monkeys. It's quite entertaining.<p class=message>That sounds delightful. Speaking of entertainment, do you have any favorite movies or TV shows?<p class="message sent">I love Game of Thrones. Have you seen it?<p class=message>Yes! It's one of my favorites too. Who's your favorite character?<p class="message sent">Definitely Tyrion Lannister. He's smart and funny.<p class=message>I agree, he's a great character. What about music? Do you listen to anything while driving?<p class="message sent">Sometimes. I like classic rock. What about you?<p class=message>I like a bit of everything, but lately I've been into indie pop.<p class="message sent">I haven't heard much of that genre. Any recommendations?<p class=message>Sure, I can show you some of my favorite songs on my phone when we get to our destination.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. We have a bit of a drive ahead of us, so it'll be nice to have some new tunes to listen to.<p class=message>Agreed! Thanks for being such a friendly and accommodating driver.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, it's my pleasure. Enjoy your trip in Chongqing!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f7a5d633-8704-4268-8f14-e7ba177bf1e8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
