How are you today?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm doing well thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great. I have been working on curriculum design for our upcoming course and I wanted to talk to you about the selection of teaching materials.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. What kind of materials are you considering?<p class=message>I'm thinking about adding some interactive activities and multimedia resources. We can also incorporate some fun quizzes to keep the students engaged.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea! What about textbooks?<p class=message>I have two options in mind. One is a classic textbook, while the other is a new online platform that offers interactive lessons.<p class="message sent">I think we should definitely go with the latter. It's more engaging and also allows for easy tracking of student progress.<p class=message>That's a good point. I like that idea too. What about audio and video materials?<p class="message sent">We can definitely use some audio clips and video resources to supplement our lessons. This will help our students to improve their listening and speaking skills.<p class=message>Agreed. I was thinking of using TED Talks and other authentic materials to expose our students to real-life situations.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love that idea! Using authentic resources is a great way to challenge our students and help them improve their language skills.<p class=message>Yes, it is. Another idea I had was to incorporate some role-playing and simulation activities to make the learning process more enjoyable.<p class="message sent">I love that idea too! It's a fantastic way to practice language in a real-life context.<p class=message>Great! That settles it then. We will use the online platform, audio and video materials, authentic resources, and role-playing activities.<p class="message sent">Perfect! I think our students will really enjoy this course.<p class=message>Thank you, B. I appreciate your input. This will be a great success.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=10d69ee3-2bc3-4e3b-b447-5107add3fbe3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
