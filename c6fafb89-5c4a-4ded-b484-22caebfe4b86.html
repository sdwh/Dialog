So, what made you interested in moving the app to the cloud platform?<p class=message>Well, for starters, our current system is not efficient enough to handle large volumes of data. Also, cloud migration can help us reduce hardware and maintenance costs.<p class="message sent">That's right! And with cloud computing, our app will be more scalable and secure.<p class=message>Exactly! We should determine which cloud platform is the best fit for our app. Have you had any experience with any cloud platforms?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have a lot of experience with Amazon Web Services. It's user-friendly and the support system is great.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Now we need to consider the pricing plan and if it will fit our budget.<p class="message sent">Yes, I've done some research on pricing plans and I believe we can find a good deal with AWS.<p class=message>That sounds promising. We also need to ensure migration is smooth, so our users don't experience any disruptions or downtime.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, we should consider using a testing environment before migrating to the cloud.<p class=message>Great idea! By the way, have you heard of cloud bursting?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's when the system automates the additional infrastructure requests when the workload exceeds the capacity.<p class=message>That's right! Cloud bursting can help us handle any spikes in traffic without slowing down the system.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. Overall, I think we're on the right track to making this migration happen smoothly and efficiently.<p class=message>Yes, it's really exciting to be considering this change. Thanks for collaborating with me, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A! It's always fun brainstorming new tech solutions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c6fa2369-e4bb-458d-99af-9ca2d5caea94.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
