Just a few tweaks left, and then we'll have it fully functional.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I was wondering if you could help me a bit with the design aspect of it.<p class="message sent">Of course, happy to help. What kind of changes are you looking to make?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of adding more visual elements to the user interface. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about incorporating some gradient color schemes and subtle animations? It could really spruce up the overall look.<p class=message>You know, that's not a bad idea at all. Thanks for the suggestion, B.<p class="message sent">No problem. By the way, have you tried the complimentary breakfast here at the hotel? It's pretty good.<p class=message>Oh, I haven't yet. I've only been grabbing coffee on the way in.<p class="message sent">You're missing out! They have all sorts of pastries, fruit, and even made-to-order omelets.<p class=message>Well, maybe I'll have to come in a bit earlier tomorrow and check it out.<p class="message sent">Definitely do. And while we're on the subject, have you stayed in many hotels during business trips?<p class=message>Yeah, quite a few. Why do you ask?<p class="message sent">Oh, just curious what your favorite hotel amenity is.<p class=message>Hmm, that's tough. I'd probably say the fitness center. It's nice to be able to squeeze in a workout after a day of meetings.<p class="message sent">I hear you. Personally, I'm all about the free toiletries. Can never have too much shampoo and conditioner, you know?<p class=message>(Laughs) Yeah, I can see how that would be a big plus. But on that note, we should probably get back to work. Thanks for chatting, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2125c96e-d87c-4e5e-993b-129c1302e170.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
