How's it going?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. It's going pretty well. Thanks for asking. How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm doing great. We've got a lot on our plate today, with all these orders coming in.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's busy. But that's good for business. Do you think we have enough bread to get us through the day?<p class=message>I made an extra batch of sourdough last night, so we should be okay. But we might need to make more ciabatta later.<p class="message sent">Got it. And how's the new pastry recipe coming along?<p class=message>It's still a work in progress, but I think we're close to perfecting it. I'll let you taste-test later.<p class="message sent">Awesome. I can't wait. Hey, have you talked to our coffee supplier recently?<p class=message>No, not in the last week or so. Do we need to order more beans?<p class="message sent">Yeah, we're getting low. And we might want to look for a new flavor to add to the menu.<p class=message>I'll give them a call later today. Oh, speaking of our menu, I think we should try making some pumpkin muffins for the fall season.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. Let's add it to our list of specials for October. Oh, and we also need to start prepping for Thanksgiving.<p class=message>Right. We should start thinking about what kinds of pies we'll make this year.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's brainstorm some new ideas. Hey, did you hear that a new bakery is opening up down the street?<p class=message>Really? I hadn't heard. That could mean more competition for us.<p class="message sent">Maybe. But we've got a loyal customer base and some truly delicious baked goods. I'm not too worried.<p class=message>Yeah, you're right. Our bread and pastries speak for themselves. Plus, we have the best boss in town.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Flattery will get you everywhere, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=65b239a5-7941-4915-bef8-d6c768cd0fbb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
