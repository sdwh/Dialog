Perfect for a hunting trip!<p class="message sent">Yes, I couldn't agree more. I'm really excited to prepare some delicious wild game dishes with whatever we catch.<p class=message>Well, let's get to it!

Let's quietly approach it.<p class=message>Gotcha! That was a clean shot.<p class="message sent">Great job, let's prepare it right away. Do you have a recipe in mind?<p class=message>Yeah, my family has a secret marinade that we use for rabbit. It's super tasty.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect.
