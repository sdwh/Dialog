Have a seat. We're discussing the course schedule for the upcoming trimester.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Academic Director A. Thanks for having me.<p class=message>I'm happy to have you. Let's start by looking at the core courses we plan to offer this trimester. What do you think about the class sizes?<p class="message sent">I think we should keep them small. This helps with student engagement and participation.<p class=message>That's a great point. What about elective courses? Any new ideas?<p class="message sent">How about a course on modern art? We could explore different movements and the impact they've had on society.<p class=message>I love it! We'll make sure to include it in our offerings. How about scheduling? Should we stagger classes throughout the week or have them back-to-back?<p class="message sent">In my experience, it's better to stagger them. This way, students can have time to review notes and prepare for the next class.<p class=message>Makes sense. Speaking of review, what do you think about midterms and finals?<p class="message sent">I think we should maintain a balanced mix between exams and projects. This way, students can showcase their understanding in different ways and challenge themselves.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. It's important to have a variety of assessments. Anything else on your mind for this trimester?<p class="message sent">How about a field trip? We could take the students to a local museum or gallery as part of the modern art course.<p class=message>Fantastic idea! We'll work on the logistics and make it happen. Thanks for your input, Professor B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Academic Director A. I'm excited to see what this trimester has in store.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=23426033-3a9c-46de-aa8b-1f087b8e2d90.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
