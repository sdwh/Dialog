I am thrilled to be here tonight at the Sydney Opera House.<p class="message sent">We are so excited to have you here. I've been looking forward to this concert for weeks.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Which piece are you most excited to hear me perform tonight?<p class="message sent">Definitely your rendition of Mozart's Symphony No. 40 in G minor. It's always been a personal favorite of mine.<p class=message>Ah, yes! That's a truly beautiful piece. I'm so glad you enjoy it.<p class="message sent">How do you prepare for a performance like this?<p class=message>I like to spend some quiet time warming up, visualizing the performance, and focusing on my breathing.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good strategy. Is there any particular routine you follow?<p class=message>Yes, I always make sure to do some stretching exercises and vocal warm-ups. I also like to review my sheet music and mentally go through each piece.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of work but it definitely pays off. What's it like performing at the Sydney Opera House?<p class=message>It's absolutely amazing! The acoustics are outstanding and the atmosphere is absolutely electric.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. The Opera House is such an iconic venue and is always a treat to visit.<p class=message>Yes, and I think we're so lucky to have it in Sydney. It's a real cultural gem.<p class="message sent">Speaking of gems, do you have any upcoming projects or performances we can look forward to?<p class=message>Absolutely. I'm currently working on a tour across Europe next year, and I also have plans for some smaller recitals in the near future.<p class="message sent">That all sounds fantastic, and I can't wait to see you perform again. Thank you so much for this wonderful performance tonight.<p class=message>Thank you for having me, it's been an incredible experience.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3ab35015-5480-4ffb-a057-bd81e122d6fd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
