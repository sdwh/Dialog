We had to bring all our experience to survive.<p class=message>That sounds scary. What did you do to cope with the situation?<p class="message sent">We used our knowledge of navigation to avoid the worst of the storm and we made sure that all our equipment was properly secured.<p class=message>Interesting. Do you think that the Coast Guard could have supported you better in that situation?<p class="message sent">Well, we did contact them and they sent a rescue ship, but it took quite a while to reach us due to the bad weather conditions.<p class=message>Oh, I see. Based on that experience, do you have any advice on how we can be better prepared for a disaster at sea?<p class="message sent">We should always make sure that our communication and navigation equipment are in top condition and that we have enough food and water supplies in case we get stranded for a while.<p class=message>That's great advice. Another thing we should always do is to keep an eye on the weather forecast and to always have a backup plan in case something unexpected happens.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We can never be too prepared when it comes to dealing with the power of the sea. We must always be ready for anything.<p class=message>Well, it looks like we have a lot to think about, but thank you for sharing your experience and advice with me, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always good to have a fellow shipmate who takes their responsibilities seriously. Remember, we're all in this together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5149a174-a4e0-49d8-bc13-e09a78a4659b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
