How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, excited to finally visit Shanghai!<p class="message sent">Oh, that's fantastic! What brings you here?<p class=message>Just some sightseeing and trying out the local cuisine - I hear the soup dumplings are amazing.<p class="message sent">Yes, the dumplings are definitely a must-try. Have you had any yet?<p class=message>No, not yet. Any recommendations for a good place?<p class="message sent">Well, there are quite a few great dumpling restaurants around here. I personally like Din Tai Fung, but it can get pretty crowded.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation. Hey, have you ever tried the fried scorpion on a stick?<p class="message sent">Ha! No, I haven't. That's definitely not my thing.<p class=message>Haha, I heard it's a delicacy here. Maybe I'll be brave enough to try it.<p class="message sent">You're much braver than I am. Just make sure to have some water around to wash it down!<p class=message>I definitely will. So, how long have you been a taxi driver in Shanghai?<p class="message sent">Oh, for about five years now. It's a pretty busy job, but I enjoy meeting new people like you.<p class=message>That's great. I'm sure you've driven all over the city by now.<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's always exciting to see new places and learn about different cultures.<p class=message>I completely agree. This is my first time in Asia and I'm already loving it.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that. Shanghai is a vibrant city with lots to offer. I hope you have a wonderful trip.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3b0c3220-2212-4f2a-bdf3-1cb3b35e81d2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
