Your stamina needs work.<p class=message>Yeah, I know. So, what's next?<p class="message sent">We'll work on your agility now. I have some cones set up for you to run through.<p class=message>Sounds like fun. I needed a break from running laps.<p class="message sent">Agility training is also important for your sport. It helps you change direction quickly.<p class=message>I'm ready. Let's do this!<p class="message sent">Great. Remember to stay light on your feet and don't trip on the cones.<p class=message>(laughs) I'll try not to. Hey coach, do you have any tips for keeping my energy up during long games?<p class="message sent">Take small sips of water throughout the game, eat snacks like bananas, and keep moving during breaks.<p class=message>Thanks, coach. Do you have a favorite snack that you like to eat during games?<p class="message sent">I like to snack on trail mix. It gives me the energy I need to keep going.<p class=message>Trail mix? That's not too exciting.<p class="message sent">(laughs) It's not as exciting as candy, but it's healthier.<p class=message>You're right. I'll have to give it a try.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's get back to training. We have a lot of work to do if we want to win our next game.<p class=message>Yes, sir! I'll give it my all!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1e547eeb-68d6-4617-ba9e-5a7c5067fd80.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
