Have you lived here for a long time?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have been a taxi driver here for over 10 years. It's a beautiful city with a rich history.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm particularly interested in the food here. Any recommendations?<p class="message sent">You definitely have to try out the famous duck blood soup and Nanjing salted duck. You can find them in many local restaurants.<p class=message>Duck blood soup? That sounds a bit unusual to me, but I love trying new things!<p class="message sent">It might sound strange, but it's really delicious. Trust me, you won't regret it.<p class=message>Okay, I'll give it a try. By the way, have you ever had any interesting passengers during your career?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. One time, a passenger forgot their baby in my taxi! It was quite a surprise for both of us.<p class=message>Oh wow, that must have been really scary for the passenger. Did you manage to return the baby safely?<p class="message sent">Yes, I immediately contacted the passenger and returned the baby to them. It was a huge relief for everyone!<p class=message>That's such a heartwarming story. I'm glad everything turned out well. So, do you have any hobbies outside of work?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love playing basketball with my friends. It's a great way to stay active and relieve stress.<p class=message>That sounds fun! I might have to try playing basketball myself. Do you have any tips for beginners?<p class="message sent">My advice is to practice as much as possible and don't be afraid to make mistakes. It's all about having fun and improving gradually.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. I'm looking forward to exploring Nanjing and trying all the amazing food here.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! As a local, I'm always happy to help visitors discover the best parts of our city.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7607d45a-5d57-4ecf-942d-0c567503d406.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
