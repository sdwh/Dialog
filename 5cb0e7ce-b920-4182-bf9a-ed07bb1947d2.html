I think I found out what the problem was. It was a bug in the code.<p class=message>Oh no! Not the dreaded bug! How did you manage to find it?<p class="message sent">Oh, I just put on my detective hat and followed the trail of errors. It took me a bit of time, but I finally found it.<p class=message>You're a regular Sherlock Holmes! So, what did you do to get rid of the bug?<p class="message sent">I just wrote some code to squash it. It was like playing bug whack-a-mole!<p class=message>Ha! I'm sure the bug didn't stand a chance with you as the exterminator. So, is the system working smoothly now?<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. And I even added a few features while I was at it. I hope you'll find them useful.<p class=message>That's wonderful! I'm so grateful for your expertise. Thank you so much, B!<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure, A. Anything to make our work here easier and more enjoyable.<p class=message>Speaking of enjoyable, have you seen the new coffee machine they installed in the break room?<p class="message sent">I have! It's pretty fancy. I like it a latte.<p class=message>Ah, I see what you did there. You're a real bean connoisseur.<p class="message sent">Just call me the coffee detective!<p class=message>Ha! With that kind of energy, you could solve any problem that comes our way.<p class="message sent">Of course! That's why they call us the dynamic duo of IT.<p class=message>Yes, indeed. We're like Batman and Robin of the digital age. But with less spandex and more caffeine.<p class="message sent">Hey, you never know when spandex might come in handy. It could be the secret to solving our next issue!<p class=message>Oh, please, let's hope it doesn't come to that. But, you're right, it never hurts to be prepared for anything.<p class="message sent">That's the spirit! With us on the case, there's no problem we can't solve.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5caac3eb-dbaa-4250-9ebe-248fda5a12df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
