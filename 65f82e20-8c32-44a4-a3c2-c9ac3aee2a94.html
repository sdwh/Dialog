Do you mind if I sit in the front seat?<p class="message sent">Not at all, please come on over.<p class=message>Thanks. So, how's the traffic today?<p class="message sent">It's not too bad, considering we're heading towards central Delhi.<p class=message>That's good to know. I'm just glad I'm not the one driving in this chaos.<p class="message sent">Oh, driving in Delhi is not that bad. You just need to be alert at all times.<p class=message>That's easier said than done for us tourists.<p class="message sent">True. But I can assure you, you're in safe hands with me.<p class=message>I believe you. By the way, I saw your dashboard - are those your kids?<p class="message sent">Yes, they are. They remind me of why I work so hard every day.<p class=message>They are adorable. How old are they?<p class="message sent">My son is ten and my daughter is six. They keep me on my toes.<p class=message>Sounds like they give you a lot of joy.<p class="message sent">They certainly do. I couldn't imagine my life without them.<p class=message>Well, that's great to hear. You seem like a great dad.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I try my best. It's not always easy, but it's definitely worth it.<p class=message>I understand. Parenthood is a tough job, but rewarding.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. Okay, we're almost there. Are you excited about your visit to Delhi?<p class=message>Yes, very much so. It seems like such a vibrant city.<p class="message sent">That it is. You'll love it here, I'm sure. Have a great time!<p class=message>Thank you, and have a good day ahead!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=65f7f3ff-4453-4fcd-91f7-c5ed30838ef5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
