Glad you brought it up. How do you think we should approach this?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking we could start by implementing a DevOps culture within our teams.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Being able to collaborate and communicate effectively between development and operations is key.<p class=message>Exactly, and it also allows us to automate processes and speed up deployments.<p class="message sent">Yeah, and we can also incorporate security and testing into the development process.<p class=message>That's definitely important in the insurance industry. But I'm curious, have you ever tried using a continuous delivery approach?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have! And it's been a game changer. It's allowed us to provide faster and more reliable software to customers.<p class=message>That's impressive! I also think we should prioritize using tools that simplify the workflow and increase efficiency.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We can leverage automation tools, such as containerization and monitoring, to streamline operations.<p class=message>It sounds like we have a solid plan! Thanks for your input, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A! It's always exciting to find ways to improve and innovate.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=59a65b5c-bdb4-4ebc-8a31-f701c42a7fcf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
