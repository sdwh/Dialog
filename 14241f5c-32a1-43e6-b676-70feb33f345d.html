It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm A, a tea master and I am excited to collaborate with your restaurant.<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm thrilled to have you here at our restaurant to enhance our dining experience with tea pairings. What types of tea are you suggesting?<p class=message>We have a variety of teas that can complement your dishes. For your seafood entr√©e, I recommend a light-bodied green tea such as Sencha or Genmaicha.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! What about for our grilled steak entree?<p class=message>For steak, I recommend a bold and full-bodied black tea. With its tannins and richness, Darjeeling or Ceylon tea would be a great choice.<p class="message sent">I never thought about pairing tea with steak before. That's brilliant! How about our dessert menu?<p class=message>For dessert, a fragrant and floral tea such as Jasmine would be a great match to balance the sweetness. Or, if you prefer something with a stronger flavor, you could try a smoky Lapsang Souchong tea.<p class="message sent">Oh, I like the sound of that one! We'll definitely add those options to our menu.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. It's all about creating a unique experience for your guests that they can't find anywhere else.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We want our guests to have an unforgettable dining experience. Thank you for showing us the way.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. I'm happy to help your restaurant stand out in the competitive world of dining.<p class="message sent">I think our partnership will do just that. Let's raise a cup of tea to our success!<p class=message>Cheers to that! May our collaboration bring happiness to all who dine here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1421a8d1-518a-4783-9e06-f26b302aa5c3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
