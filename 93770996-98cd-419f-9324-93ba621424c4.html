Can we watch something more light-hearted?<p class="message sent">Sure, what about that romantic comedy I saw on Netflix last week?<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let me make some popcorn first.<p class="message sent">And I'll grab some drinks.<p class="message sent">Wow, this movie is really funny.<p class=message>I know, right? I love the lead actress, she always cracks me up.<p class="message sent">Speaking of actresses, did you know that the lead actor in this movie was in a hit TV show back in the '90s?<p class=message>Really? No way! What show?<p class="message sent">"Friends"! He played one of the recurring characters.<p class=message>I never would have guessed! That's so cool.<p class=message>This popcorn is so good. I think I'm eating more than I should be.<p class="message sent">That's okay, we don't always have to be healthy.<p class=message>You're right. And watching movies is a fun way to relax and enjoy some downtime, especially with family.<p class="message sent">Exactly. It's nice to just cuddle up on the couch and enjoy a movie together.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Speaking of which, this movie is almost over. What should we watch next?<p class="message sent">How about that documentary we were talking about last week?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Let's finish up this popcorn and get started on that.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9372b759-8f13-487c-b056-94bc1edee77a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
