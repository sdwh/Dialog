It's one of my favorite Japanese dishes! Have you tried it?<p class=message>Nope, not yet. I'm curious about it though. What's in it?<p class="message sent">Well, it's basically a savory pancake made with a batter of flour, eggs, and cabbage. But you can add different toppings like pork belly, shrimp, or even cheese and mayo.<p class=message>Haha, cheese and mayo on a pancake? That sounds kind of weird.<p class="message sent">I know right? But trust me, it's delicious. You just have to give it a try.<p class=message>Alright, you convinced me. Where can we find a good Okonomiyaki place around here?<p class="message sent">There's actually a great restaurant just a few blocks away. We should go there for lunch later.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. I'm excited to try this creation that you're talking about.<p class="message sent">Just remember, you'll have to cook it yourself on a hot grill and flip it over with a spatula. It's a fun and interactive way to eat.<p class=message>Oh wow, it's like we're chefs in a way. I can't wait to show off my cooking skills.<p class="message sent">Haha, don't worry if you mess up. It'll still taste just as good.<p class=message>Okay, so let me get this straight. We're going to a restaurant to make our own food, with toppings like cheese and mayo, on a grill. Did I miss anything?<p class="message sent">Nope, that pretty much sums it up. Get ready for a unique dining experience.<p class=message>I'm all in! Thanks for introducing me to this interesting dish, B. Let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=60f1d66a-3218-4502-bdbc-865df6e7b25d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
