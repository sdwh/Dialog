Can you help me out?<p class="message sent">Of course! What kind of places are you interested in visiting?<p class=message>Well, I want to see some traditional temples, but also some more modern attractions. Maybe some museums and parks as well.<p class="message sent">Great! You could start with a visit to Longshan Temple. It's one of the oldest and most famous temples in Taipei.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. What else do you recommend?<p class="message sent">For a more modern experience, you could visit Taipei 101. It's the tallest building in Taipei and has an incredible observatory on the top floor.<p class=message>Wow, that's definitely a must-see. Any parks or green spaces you suggest?<p class="message sent">Definitely. You could check out Daan Forest Park, which is one of the largest parks in Taipei. There's a lot to do there, including a botanical garden and a lake with paddle boats.<p class=message>Sounds like the perfect place to unwind. Are there any museums worth visiting?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. The National Palace Museum has a huge collection of Chinese artifacts, including ancient pottery and jade.<p class=message>I'd love to see that. What about food? Where can I find the best Taiwanese cuisine?<p class="message sent">One great option is the night markets, like the famous Shilin Night Market. You can find all kinds of street food there, from stinky tofu to pan-fried dumplings.<p class=message>Yum! Okay, I think I have my itinerary. Thanks so much for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Have a great time in Taipei!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=67fff6eb-f25d-4c39-8095-a8aed99f0188.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
