Welcome to our little village in Tasmania.<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm B, a chef from the city. I'm excited to learn about the traditional seafood dishes in your area.<p class=message>Well, you came to the right place. We catch some of the freshest seafood around here.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. What's on the menu for today's cooking class?<p class=message>Today we'll be making a delicious seafood stew with a mix of shrimps, mussels, and octopus.<p class="message sent">Yum! That sounds amazing. What are some of the secret ingredients that make this stew unique?<p class=message>We use a special blend of herbs and spices from the local market to give it that extra kick. And we also add a bit of cream to make it creamy and thick.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to try it. So, what's the first step?<p class=message>First, we need to clean the seafood properly and then saut√© them in a pan with some garlic and onions.<p class="message sent">Got it. And what about the seasoning?<p class=message>We add in some white wine, tomatoes, and the herbs and spices. After that, we let it simmer for about 20 minutes.<p class="message sent">That sounds easy enough. Can we also make a side dish to go with it?<p class=message>Sure, we can make some garlic bread to go with the stew. It's simple but it complements the flavors well.<p class="message sent">Perfect. I'm excited to get started.<p class=message>Great, let's get cooking! And don't forget to grab a beer from the fridge, it's the perfect drink to go with a seafood stew.<p class="message sent">Cheers to that!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f4fd9c6a-49ba-453b-b827-e8a49f3190f8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
