Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today.<p class="message sent">Of course, it's great to speak with you as well. Can you tell me a little bit about your relevant experience in software engineering?<p class=message>Sure! I have a degree in computer science and have worked as a full-stack developer for the last 3 years. I'm really passionate about software development and am always looking for ways to improve my skills.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Can you tell me about any specific projects you've worked on that you're particularly proud of?<p class=message>Absolutely! One project that stands out was when I worked on a team that developed an app for managing inventory for a small business. It was really rewarding to see how much easier we made things for the business owner.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great accomplishment. How would you say your technical skills match with what we're looking for in this role?<p class=message>I think my experience with front-end technologies like React and my familiarity with back-end languages like Java and Python makes me a great fit for this position.<p class="message sent">That's exactly what we're looking for. Let me just confirm your educational background--you said you have a degree in computer science?<p class=message>Yes, that's correct. I received my degree from a top university in my country.<p class="message sent">Wonderful. Well, it's been great speaking with you today.
