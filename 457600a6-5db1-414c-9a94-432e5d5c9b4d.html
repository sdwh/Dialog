Nice to see you visiting our farm. I'm Farmer A.<p class="message sent">Thanks for having me, Farmer A. I'm Dr. B, the veterinarian for your livestock.<p class=message>Perfect timing, actually. We were just about to do our annual checkup on the cows and pigs.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll get right to it. How many animals do you have on this farm?<p class=message>Well, we have about 50 cows and 100 pigs. Plenty to keep us busy.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of work. Let's start with the cows. How are they doing this year?<p class=message>Pretty well, I think. They've been healthy and happy.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. Let me take a look. Oh, this one seems to have a bit of a limp. Have you noticed that?<p class=message>No, I haven't. I guess I need to pay more attention.<p class="message sent">No problem. It's easy to miss something like that. I'll give her a closer look and see what we can do.<p class=message>Thank you, Dr. B. What about the pigs? Any concerns there?<p class="message sent">They look healthy overall, but a few of them are a bit overweight. I'll give you some tips on how to keep their diet in check.<p class=message>Sounds good. We want our animals to be healthy and happy. They're like family to us.<p class="message sent">I understand completely. That's why I do what I do. It's important to keep them healthy and thriving.<p class=message>We appreciate your help, Dr. B. You're always welcome here at our farm.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure, Farmer A. I'll make sure your animals are in good hands.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4574b0db-2fd9-4c60-ad22-82acce6f5a67.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
