It's a true Australian delicacy.<p class=message>That does sound delicious. What makes Australian cuisine unique compared to other cuisines in the world?<p class="message sent">Australian cuisine is heavily influenced by the diverse cultures that make up our society. This includes Aboriginal, British, Mediterranean, and Asian cuisines. We like to mix and match all these different flavors to create new and exciting dishes.<p class=message>I see. That's really fascinating. So, what kind of wine would you recommend pairing with the grilled kangaroo loin?<p class="message sent">Our wine list is carefully curated to complement our dishes. For the grilled kangaroo, I recommend pairing it with a full-bodied Shiraz.<p class=message>Excellent recommendation. I'm sure our guests will enjoy that. Last question, B. What's your personal favorite dish on the menu?<p class="message sent">My personal favorite is the barramundi with pickled fennel, blood orange, and macadamia.
