How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was great, thanks for asking! How about you?<p class=message>Not bad, not bad. Anyway, we have a meeting with the boss in the conference room, so let's get going.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. I hope it's not going to be too boring.<p class=message>Yeah, me too. But you know how the boss can be, always serious and all.<p class="message sent">That's true. But let's hope he'll surprise us with a bit of humor this time.<p class=message>I doubt it, but we can always dream. Hey, did you hear about the time he tried to tell a joke during a meeting and nobody laughed?<p class="message sent">No, what happened?<p class=message>Well, he got really embarrassed and ended up making a bunch of dad jokes the whole meeting just to try and make up for it.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's hilarious. I wish I could have been there to see it.<p class=message>Yeah, it was pretty funny. Hey, do you think we should bring some snacks for the meeting?<p class="message sent">Good idea, some chocolate maybe? Or chips?<p class=message>Both sound good to me. Let's stop by the vending machine on the way.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's go. I have a feeling this meeting is going to be a long one.<p class=message>True, but with snacks and each other's company, we can survive anything.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's rock this meeting!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c6cf91a5-956f-4dcb-9dac-0f01a341e891.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
