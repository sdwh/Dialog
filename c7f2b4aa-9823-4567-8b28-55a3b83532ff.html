Our matcha mille-feuille and your pour-over coffee.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Your pastry looks so exquisite, I wouldn't want to ruin it with a bad cup of coffee.<p class=message>(laughs) You're too kind. But I'm confident, your coffee will only elevate the flavor of our dessert.<p class="message sent">Let's hope so! But honestly, I couldn't wait to try your matcha mille-feuille. I heard so many good things about it.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. I put a lot of heart and effort into creating all of our desserts, especially the matcha mille-feuille.<p class="message sent">It shows. It's so smooth, creamy, and not too sweet. Perfect balance. And now, for the coffee.<p class=message>Ah, I see you're using the V60. Is that your go-to?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a classic. It brings out the subtle flavors of the coffee. I'm using a Kenyan medium roast, which should have a fruity acidity.<p class=message>Sounds like a great match with our matcha. The combination of fruity and earthy notes would be pleasing to the palate.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Exactly. This is what I love about coffee and pastry. They both have their unique flavors, but sometimes they can surprise you when they complement each other.<p class=message>It's like a dance, isn't it? When the flavors swirl together, and create something new and beautiful.<p class="message sent">(nods) And it's always a pleasure to have talented partners like you in this dance. I mean, look at this work of art.<p class=message>(beaming) Thank you so much!<p class="message sent">No, thank you. It's been an enjoyable afternoon. I guess we should open a pastry-coffee shop together someday, huh?<p class=message>(laughs) Why not? We should call it "The Perfect Pair"!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c7e8f227-9137-49aa-8b5e-1f0e61fd2b1a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
