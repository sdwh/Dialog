What do you suggest we do to improve our test coverage?<p class=message>We could start with adding more test cases, but we don't want to sacrifice speed for thoroughness.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. Maybe we could automate some of our tests to speed things up.<p class=message>Yeah, but we need to make sure our automation covers all possible scenarios.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Have you ever tried exploratory testing? It allows us to discover new issues that traditional testing might miss.<p class=message>I've heard of it, but I'm not too familiar with it. Can you explain how it works?<p class="message sent">Basically, it's testing without a set script. We explore the software, looking for issues as we go.<p class=message>Interesting. How do we document our findings?<p class="message sent">We can take screenshots or notes as we explore the software. It's less structured, but it's a great way to find new issues.<p class=message>That sounds like a fun way to test. Have we considered using professional testers that specialize in exploratory testing?<p class="message sent">We haven't, but it's a great idea. Professional testers can provide valuable insight and help us discover new issues.<p class=message>How about we involve the development team earlier in the testing process? That way, they can identify potential issues before we begin testing.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. It'll help us prevent issues before they even occur.<p class=message>Is there anything else we could do to improve our test coverage?<p class="message sent">We could perform regression testing whenever we make changes to the software to ensure we're not breaking existing features.<p class=message>Good suggestion. It's always best to catch issues before they get to production.<p class="message sent">Definitely- our end-users will thank us for it.<p class=message>Agreed. Thanks for the brainstorming session, B. Let's implement these ideas and improve our test coverage.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, A. Let's make it happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c192166f-720b-4cb6-b94a-2b936fba63cd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
