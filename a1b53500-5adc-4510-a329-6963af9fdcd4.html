Welcome to the Darwin Tourist Centre. How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm looking for something fun to do in Darwin. What do you recommend?<p class=message>There are lots of amazing things to do here! Have you considered a crocodile cruise on the Adelaide River?<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds exciting! Do you get to see many crocodiles?<p class=message>Absolutely! You have a great chance of seeing some large saltwater crocodiles in their natural habitat. It's definitely a unique experience.<p class="message sent">That does sound amazing, but I'm not sure if I'm brave enough for that. What else do you suggest?<p class=message>Well, another fun activity is visiting the Mindil Beach Sunset Market. There are over 200 food and craft stalls, live music, and breathtaking views of the sunset.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds perfect! When is the market open?<p class=message>It's open every Thursday and Sunday from April to October. And it's free entry!<p class="message sent">That's fantastic. Thank you for the recommendation. What's a must-try local dish in Darwin?<p class=message>You can't visit Darwin without trying some fresh barramundi! It's a type of fish that's popular in the Northern Territory. It's usually served grilled or fried with a side of chips.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds delicious! Where can I find the best barramundi?<p class=message>An amazing place to try it is at The Parap Village Market. They have a wide variety of cuisines and vendors, and their barramundi is always fresh.<p class="message sent">Thanks for all the great suggestions! I can't wait to explore Darwin more.<p class=message>My pleasure! Enjoy your time here and let us know if you need any more assistance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a1b376b9-fece-4d48-a548-962d6bdfbe2e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
