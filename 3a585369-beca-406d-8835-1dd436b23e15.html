How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, thanks! How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. I wanted to ask you something - have you thought about any other requirements for the new project?<p class="message sent">Funny you should ask, I was actually just brainstorming some ideas. I think we need to make sure we have a good communication plan in place.<p class=message>I totally agree. How about we also make sure we set clear expectations for each team member's responsibilities?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! And we should add a section for contingency planning, just in case something unexpected happens.<p class=message>Yes, that's definitely important. I think we should also consider any potential obstacles that may arise and have a plan in place to handle them.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And, what about creating a timeline for the project? That way, we can make sure we're on track and not falling behind schedule.<p class=message>Perfect, I like the sound of that. Another thing to consider is assessing the risks involved and coming up with strategies to minimize them.<p class="message sent">Great point. And how about including a section on how to measure success, so we can make sure the project is meeting its objectives?<p class=message>Yes, that's crucial. And let's not forget to make sure that we have the necessary resources and budget to complete the project on time.<p class="message sent">Good thinking. And maybe we can also have a plan for how we'll handle any issues that may arise between team members during the project.<p class=message>Yes, a conflict resolution plan would be a good idea. And, how about setting up regular check-ins to discuss progress and identify any areas for improvement?<p class="message sent">Excellent suggestion. I think we're really nailing down some essential requirements here.<p class=message>Agreed. It's important that we consider all possible scenarios and come up with a comprehensive plan. Anything else you can think of?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think that covers everything. This is going to be one well-planned and successful project!<p class=message>Definitely. Thanks for discussing this with me; I feel more confident about our plan now!<p class="message sent">No problem! Always happy to chat about project requirements with a fellow TOEIC gold level speaker!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3a5022af-c5aa-44e6-9adf-fea6de7803f2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
