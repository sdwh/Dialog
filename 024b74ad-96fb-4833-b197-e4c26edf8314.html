How about you?<p class=message>I think it's smooth and efficient, although there are a few bugs that we still need to fix.<p class="message sent">Right, but I reckon we can squash them in no time, don't you?<p class=message>Absolutely, it just takes a little elbow grease and some trial-and-error to get to the bottom of it.<p class="message sent">Speaking of trial-and-error, did you hear about the developer who tried to implement gravity into their code?<p class=message>No, what happened?<p class="message sent">Yeah, well, it didn't work out – their code just kept creating black holes.<p class=message>Oops! Let's hope we don't make the same mistake with our code, haha.<p class="message sent">Definitely! But if we do, we can always credit ourselves as the first developers to create a virtual singularity.<p class=message>I like the way you think. But let's stick to basic functionalities for now, shall we?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Hey, have you heard about that new coding boot camp opening up next door?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Are you thinking of enrolling?<p class="message sent">Maybe. But I feel like we already have the expertise we need to become coding ninjas – we just need to wield our powers wisely.<p class=message>Agreed. It's not about what we know, but how we apply it. Speaking of which, let's get back to work and knock out those bugs.<p class="message sent">You got it – we'll squash them like a bug!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0249f0f0-01b9-467c-af76-b32ae21025aa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
