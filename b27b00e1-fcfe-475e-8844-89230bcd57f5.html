I heard that we're planning to use both jQuery and ASP.NET MVC 5 for the development.<p class=message>Exactly! I think it's a great idea. jQuery has so many useful functions and controls that can be easily integrated into the system.<p class="message sent">Yes, and ASP.NET MVC 5 is a reliable and secure platform that can handle large amounts of data and traffic.<p class=message>I totally agree. Plus, it's so much easier to maintain and update the website using MVC architecture.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I can't wait to start working on the back-end coding and API integration.<p class=message>Same here. And I'm looking forward to creating dynamic and interactive UI using jQuery on the front-end.<p class="message sent">It's going to be an exciting project. We'll have to make sure we communicate and collaborate effectively to ensure a successful outcome.<p class=message>Definitely. Let's put our heads together and make this website one that everyone in the company will love to use.<p class="message sent">I'm all for it. And who knows, maybe we'll even win an award for the best internal website of the year.<p class=message>Haha, that would be amazing. We'll definitely have to celebrate with some cake and drinks if that happens.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. But first, let's get to work and create something awesome.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b27aa814-09a5-4064-8cd1-c6d72b24195f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
