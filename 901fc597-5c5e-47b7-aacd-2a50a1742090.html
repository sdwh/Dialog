It's such a lovely day at the harbor today.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is. But it seems like there are fewer fish to catch these days.<p class=message>That's because overfishing is becoming a real problem. It's important for us to conserve the ocean's resources.<p class="message sent">I agree, but fishing is my livelihood. What can I do?<p class=message>You can try sustainable fishing techniques, such as using fishing nets with smaller holes or using hooks that don't harm non-targeted species.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. I've heard about those techniques before. What about protecting marine life?<p class=message>One of the most important things we can do is to create marine protected areas. These areas help to build up fish populations, which then spreads to adjacent areas.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. What else can we do?<p class=message>We can also reduce plastic waste and pollution. Marine animals often mistake plastic for food, and plastic debris can negatively impact their health.<p class="message sent">I see. I'll make an effort to reduce my plastic usage. It's all of our responsibility to protect the ocean.<p class=message>Yes, it is. But we also have to remember that the ocean provides us with so many benefits, such as food and recreation.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's our duty to protect the ocean and its resources. Thanks for the advice, I'll put it into practice.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. Enjoy your day at sea!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=901efa67-7048-4861-8f76-3cf18e773e36.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
