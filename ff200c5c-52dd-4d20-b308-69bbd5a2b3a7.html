You've brought in some fantastic catches today. What do you recommend for the menu?<p class=message>I would highly recommend the smoked salmon for a starter. It's been cured with my secret recipe and then smoked to perfection.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! How about the main course? What do you have for us today?<p class=message>Well, we have some really plump and juicy lobsters that I caught this morning. They are perfect for grilling and serving with lemon butter sauce.<p class="message sent">Perfect! And for the sides, should we go for some classic mashed potatoes or something more adventurous?<p class=message>Actually, I have some greens to go with the seafood. I picked some kelp and seaweed this morning, and I think it would add a nice twist to the dish.<p class="message sent">Interesting choice, A! It's always great to try something new and different. And what about dessert?<p class=message>For dessert, we have some freshly caught squid that I sliced up into thin strips and deep-fried, then drizzled with honey, and served with caramel ice cream.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a creative dessert! Can't wait to try it out. Thanks for all your hard work in bringing in such high-quality seafood.<p class=message>My pleasure, chef! I always enjoy seeing my fresh catches turning into masterpiece dishes in your hands. Here's to a delicious meal!<p class="message sent">Cheers to that, A! Let's get cooking.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ff1f4931-488c-4879-83b4-0d765f0268a7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
