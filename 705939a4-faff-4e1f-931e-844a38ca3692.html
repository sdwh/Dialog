What a busy day it is today.<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed. Our store is always busy, especially during the weekends. What can I help you with?<p class=message>I'm one of the food processing workers for this supermarket. I was just looking around and checking our products on display.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. As a supermarket salesperson, I'm always happy to hear that our products are being checked properly.<p class=message>Exactly! I noticed that the bread section is looking empty. We need to arrange the fresh bread loaves soon.<p class="message sent">You're right. I'll notify the bakery department to get it done immediately. By the way, what do you like to eat when you take a break from work?<p class=message>I'm a big fan of salads, especially chicken Caesar. What about you?<p class="message sent">I love sushi rolls. It's light and easy to eat. There's always a big smile on my face when I eat it. Ha Ha!<p class=message>That's a great choice. Looks like we can enjoy our favourite foods together anytime we get a break from work.<p class="message sent">Definitely! It's a good thing we work in a supermarket where we can find our favourite foods easily.<p class=message>I totally agree. By the way, do you have any recommendations for a new product that we can sell?<p class="message sent">Well, we just had a new range of Japanese snacks delivered. It's worth checking out!<p class=message>Sounds interesting! I'll definitely try those snacks before leaving today.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Don't forget to let me know what you think of them.<p class=message>For sure. I'll come back and give you my review on the snacks.<p class="message sent">Looking forward to your feedback. Thanks for bringing it to our attention about the bread. Have a great day.<p class=message>You too! It's always nice to be helpful.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7055ed86-6454-4f71-aebf-2afb3710dd60.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
