How was everyone's weekend?<p class="message sent">Hi, boss! My weekend was pretty good. I went hiking with some friends and saw some beautiful views.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. What about you, Jane?<p class=message>Ah, well, that's responsible of you. Speaking of work, let's get down to business. We have some new projects to discuss today.<p class="message sent">Boss, before we jump into the work, can I just say that your tie is really cool? Where'd you get it?<p class=message>Ha, thanks! I actually found it at a thrift store. I love finding unique pieces like this.<p class=message>Well, we have a new client who wants us to revamp their website. They're looking for something modern and user-friendly.<p class="message sent">Great, I love website design. Count me in.<p class=message>Okay, sounds good. I'll assign teams for each project and we can start brainstorming ideas.<p class="message sent">Boss, before we adjourn, can I pitch an idea for a team building activity? I was thinking we could all go to that new escape room place in town.<p class=message>I like the idea, thanks for suggesting it. Alright, meeting adjourned. Let's go make some great things happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=19874a8b-98a8-43ae-909a-95e53ee9ef07.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
