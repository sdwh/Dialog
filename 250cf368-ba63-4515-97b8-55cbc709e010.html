What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I think I'll have a latte and a slice of your delicious chocolate cake.<p class=message>Excellent choice! Our chocolate cake is one of our most popular items.<p class="message sent">That's why I came here. (laughs)<p class=message>So, how's business been for you?<p class="message sent">It's been great! Lots of people seem to love our cakes, especially the ones with fresh fruit.<p class=message>I can attest to that. I've had a few myself. (smirks)<p class="message sent">(laughs) You should try our new cake. It's a lemon-meringue cheesecake.<p class=message>Mmm, that sounds divine. I'll definitely have to try it.<p class="message sent">Now, if only we had some waffles to go with that coffee...<p class=message>(smiles) Actually, I'm working on some new coffee-infused waffles. Would you like to taste test them?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! You know me too well.<p class=message>(laughs) Can't have a pastry chef as a partner without developing a sweet tooth.<p class="message sent">That's for sure. (takes a sip of his latte) Wow, this coffee really hits the spot.<p class=message>It's freshly roasted and brewed every morning. We take our coffee seriously here.<p class="message sent">It's no wonder we make such a great team. (raises his latte in a toast)<p class=message>Cheers to that! (clinks his coffee mug against B's)<p class="message sent">(smiles) Thank you for the great coffee and company. I'll see you in the kitchen.<p class=message>That you will.
