How's your day going so far, B?<p class="message sent">Hey A! It's been great thanks. How's it going with the bread making?<p class=message>It's going well, we just finished baking a fresh batch of sourdough loaves - they smell amazing!<p class="message sent">Oh wow, I can definitely smell that. Do you want to try pairing it with a particular coffee today?<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">I suggest trying our Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. It has a fruity and floral aroma that can complement the sourdough's tangy flavor.<p class=message>Sounds interesting, I'll give it a shot. By the way, any plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">I'm planning to visit a friend who just moved to Greenwich - maybe I can bring them some of our coffee and bread from here!<p class=message>That's a great idea. Greenwich is such a lovely place to explore. I might just have to tag along with you.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, the more the merrier. Did you hear the news about the upcoming bread festival in town?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's it all about?<p class="message sent">It's going to be a weekend-long event with loads of different bread makers showcasing their products. I say we check it out and get some inspiration.<p class=message>Definitely, I'm always up for learning and trying new things. Thanks for telling me about it!<p class="message sent">No problem, it's always great to share ideas with fellow foodies. I think your bread should be ready by now, want me to brew you a coffee to go with it?<p class=message>That sounds like an excellent way to start my day. Thanks, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3eac93c1-7121-4b80-945e-ca5c615db818.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
