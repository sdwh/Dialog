What can I cook for you tonight?<p class="message sent">Hi Chef, I have a customer here who's in the mood for some authentic Chinese Beef Noodle Soup.<p class=message>You got it! Our famous Chinese Beef Noodle Soup is made with hand-pulled noodles and a slow-simmered beef broth.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! How do you make your broth?<p class=message>We use a combination of beef bones, aromatic vegetables, and Chinese herbs like star anise and cinnamon. It's a labor of love, but it's worth it!<p class="message sent">The customer also wants some extra chili oil on the side. Can you recommend a good chili oil?<p class=message>Sure thing! Our house-made chili oil is a customer favorite. It's made with Sichuan peppercorns, dried chili peppers, ginger, and garlic.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds perfect! How long does it take to make the hand-pulled noodles?<p class=message>It takes around 5-7 minutes to pull one batch of noodles. It's a skill that takes years to master, but I'm proud to say that our noodles are the best in town!<p class="message sent">I believe you! Do you have any tips for someone who wants to make good noodles at home?<p class=message>The key is to use high-gluten flour and to knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic. And of course, practice makes perfect!<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice, I'll pass it on. And speaking of practice, can I watch you pull some noodles?<p class=message>Of course! I'll even let you try it yourself. It's always fun to see the look of concentration on people's faces when they're pulling noodles for the first time.<p class="message sent">That would be awesome, thank you so much Chef! I can't wait to try your famous beef noodle soup too.<p class=message>My pleasure, let's get cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c65ff17c-ec66-4bd9-80d3-e219070204e4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
