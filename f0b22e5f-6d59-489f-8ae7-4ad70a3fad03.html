How are you doing?<p class="message sent">Good morning, ma’am! I’m doing well, thank you for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I’m doing great, thanks. I’m excited to go to Manila today. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It’s a beautiful city with many interesting places to see. What are your plans for today?<p class=message>I’m planning to visit some museums and historical sites. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely! You must visit the National Museum of Fine Arts and the Rizal Park. Both are very popular among tourists.<p class=message>Sounds great. I’m also looking forward to trying some Filipino cuisine. Do you have a favorite dish?<p class="message sent">Adobo is my favorite! It’s a savory dish made with meat, soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic. You should try it!<p class=message>That sounds delicious. What kind of music do Filipinos like to listen to?<p class="message sent">Well, we love our traditional folk music, but we also love pop and rock music. Have you heard of our famous singer, Sarah Geronimo?<p class=message>No, I haven’t. What kind of music does she sing?<p class="message sent">She sings pop music and has won many awards. You should listen to her songs while you’re here.<p class=message>I’ll definitely look her up. How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I’ve been driving for 10 years now. It’s a great way to see the city and meet new people.<p class=message>That’s wonderful. Do you have any funny stories to share?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Oh, I have many! One time, a tourist forgot his luggage in my car and I had to chase him down the street to return it. It was quite a scene!<p class=message>(laughs) That sounds funny indeed. Well, we’re almost there. Thank you for the lovely conversation and the great recommendations.<p class="message sent">You’re welcome, ma’am. Enjoy your stay in Manila!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f0b09f29-194c-432a-92da-2dcc59d71d1d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
