Trying to stay on top of things. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. I was just looking over the schedule for the next few weeks. We've got a lot to do.<p class="message sent">Yeah, but at least we've got a clear plan. We should be able to get it all done on time.<p class=message>I hope so. But you know what they say about the best-laid plans...<p class="message sent">Ha! Yeah, I know. But let's stay positive.<p class=message>For sure. So, what's at the top of your to-do list this week?<p class="message sent">I'm trying to finish up the coding for that new feature. And then I'm going to try and figure out why the program keeps crashing.<p class=message>Sounds like a fun-filled week.<p class="message sent">You know it! How about you?<p class=message>I've got a lot of meetings coming up. Need to touch base with the client, talk to the marketing team...<p class="message sent">Ah, that sounds like more fun than debugging code.<p class=message>Oh yeah, for sure. Nothing like some good old-fashioned face time with the client.<p class="message sent">Hey, as long as it gets the job done, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. And hey, maybe we can treat ourselves to some pizza once we hit our milestones this week.<p class="message sent">You're reading my mind. Pizza always makes debugging easier.<p class=message>You got that right. Alright, let's get back to work. Talk to you later.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. See you around.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=91ca0937-abfe-4046-8f04-e5b79fa9cdaf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
