It's coming along nicely, but I still can't figure out why the sign-up page is giving us so much trouble.<p class=message>True, but I heard that the UI team is working on a redesign that should make it easier for users to sign up.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. Speaking of which, do you think there's a market for a dating app that matches people based on their taste in food?<p class=message>Ha! That's a unique idea. But don't you think that might limit our target audience?<p class="message sent">Maybe, but I at least know I'd use it! What about you?<p class=message>I don't know, I might stick to the traditional methods of finding a match.<p class="message sent">Fair enough. Hey, did you hear about the new restaurant that just opened up down the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What kind of food do they serve?<p class="message sent">It's a fusion restaurant - they combine traditional Italian and Japanese cuisine. I'm dying to try it out!<p class=message>That sounds like an interesting combination. Count me in for lunch!<p class="message sent">Deal. Oh, I almost forgot, have you processed those bug fixes we agreed on?<p class=message>Yeah, I just pushed them out to the staging server. I was able to track down most of the issues.<p class="message sent">Great, let's run some tests to see if everything is working as expected.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. After that, we should reward ourselves with some sushi from that new restaurant!<p class="message sent">I can't argue with that logic. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6e23c4c8-f466-45cf-921e-3c6987d30553.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
