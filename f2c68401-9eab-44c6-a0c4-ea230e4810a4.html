What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm a new employee here. Can you show me how to prepare some desserts?<p class=message>Sure, let's start with our bestseller, a slice of chocolate fudge cake. The first step is to mix the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.<p class="message sent">Wow, I can't wait to taste it. So, what's next?<p class=message>Then we add the wet ingredients, one at a time, mixing thoroughly. After that, we gently fold in the chocolate chips.<p class="message sent">It sounds easy, but I think it takes patience to make it perfect.<p class=message>Indeed, patience is key in pastry-making. Now that our cake is ready, let's top it with some whipped cream, and a cherry on top.<p class="message sent">Looks great, I'm sure it tastes even better. By the way, do you have any recommendations for tea or coffee pairing?<p class=message>Absolutely, how about a cup of organic Chamomile tea? It's a perfect match for a sweet cake like this.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the suggestion, I'll try it. By the way, are you open to hearing any feedback from customers?<p class=message>Of course, we value our customers' opinions. We would love to hear any suggestions or feedback from you.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear, I'll definitely share any ideas that come to mind. Thanks for your kindness and guidance today.<p class=message>You're welcome, it was my pleasure to share and work with you. Let's bake some more amazing desserts together soon.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f2c61a07-0883-40db-a585-6722dc9f9a4c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
