Excited to finally be heading to Perth.<p class="message sent">Yes, it'll be a long drive but I love being on the road.<p class=message>Really? I tend to get car sick after a while.<p class="message sent">Well, let's hope not! Have you been to Perth before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time. Any places you recommend we should visit?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out Kings Park and Cottesloe Beach. They're both beautiful.<p class=message>Sounds great! Have you ever been shark diving?<p class="message sent">Ha! No, I think I'll leave that to the adrenaline junkies.<p class=message>Yeah, I hear you. I might give it a go though. It's my first time in Australia after all.<p class="message sent">Well, if you do, make sure you have someone to hold onto!<p class=message>Will do! What's your favorite Australian slang word?<p class="message sent">That's a tough one. I guess I have to go with "fair dinkum". It means "true" or "genuine".<p class=message>Haha, fair dinkum. I'll have to use that one while I'm here.<p class="message sent">You should! Aussies love it when foreigners try out their slang.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh, for about 10 years now. It's a pretty flexible job and I enjoy meeting new people.<p class=message>Yeah, it's great to chat with locals and get insider tips on the best places to go.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of insider tips, make sure you try some meat pies and Tim Tams while you're here.<p class=message>Will do! I've heard great things about both.<p class="message sent">Well, we're almost at the airport. Have a great trip and enjoy Perth!<p class=message>Thanks so much for the ride and all the recommendations. You're a great taxi driver.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Have a good one!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9f4c16b0-d5fd-46c6-9237-d4111baf498a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
