Welcome to our store. How can I assist you, sir?<p class="message sent">Hi, actually, I'm a bit lost in this small town. I thought I'd stop by and check out what you have on offer.<p class=message>That's great! We've got some delicious local specialties like Kombu seaweed, Hokkaido milk candies and fresh seafood caught this morning.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting! I'm curious about the milk candies. What makes them special?<p class=message>Well, Hokkaido is known for its dairy products and these candies are made with fresh milk. They're creamy and sweet, and melt in your mouth.<p class="message sent">I'll take a bag of those! What do you recommend for someone who loves seafood?<p class=message>Our seafood is fresh from the ocean, so everything is really delicious. But if you're a fan of salmon, you have to try our salt-grilled salmon. It's one of the best items on our menu.<p class="message sent">Ok, you convinced me. I'll take that too. By the way, how long have you been running the store?<p class=message>My family has owned this store for three generations. We take pride in providing the best products to all customers who step inside.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. No wonder you have so many loyal customers!<p class=message>Thank you. We work hard to maintain our quality and customer service.<p class="message sent">I can tell. I'm really enjoying this conversation with you. Do you have any tips for a tourist like me to make the most of my time in Hokkaido?<p class=message>Yes, you should check out Niseko, a popular ski resort known for its powder snow. And don't forget to try Hokkaido's famous soup curry, it's the perfect way to warm up on a cold day.<p class="message sent">That sounds wonderful. Thank you for the recommendations and the great conversation. I'll definitely come back to your store before I leave this town.<p class=message>You're welcome! We'll be happy to see you anytime during your stay here. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2835c3bf-93eb-4a7d-a935-0ec0e142345b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
