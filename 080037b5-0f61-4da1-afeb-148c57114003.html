Can you help me out with your recommendations?<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely! What kind of style are you looking for? Classic or trendy?<p class="message received message-content">I think something classic would be better. I don't want to look back at the pictures and regret my outfit choice.<p class="message sent message-content">Good point. How about this navy pinstripe suit? It's been a popular choice for formal events lately.<p class="message received message-content">Hmm, let me try it on. Wow, I feel like James Bond in this suit!<p class="message sent message-content">You look great! The fit is perfect too. What about the shirt and tie?<p class="message received message-content">I was thinking something simple but elegant, like a white shirt and a plain teal tie.<p class="message sent message-content">Excellent choice, I think it will complete the look. How about shoes?<p class="message received message-content">I have a pair of black oxfords at home, they should work fine, right?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, those should be perfect. Don't forget a nice pocket square too, it adds a touch of sophistication.<p class="message received message-content">Oh right, thanks for reminding me. I'm glad I came to this store, you've been so helpful.<p class="message sent message-content">It's my pleasure. We want our customers to leave feeling confident and stylish. Let me know if you need any alterations or additional accessories.<p class="message received message-content">Will do, thanks again. I can't wait to rock this suit at the wedding!<p class="message sent message-content">You're welcome, have a great time at the wedding!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=07fbda9f-8b44-49be-9142-6ccc0bf543bb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
