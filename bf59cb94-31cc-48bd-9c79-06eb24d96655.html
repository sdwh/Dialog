It's great to see you here in Canberra.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. It's lovely to be here with you. So, I heard you finished writing your book. Can I take a look?<p class=message>Of course! I just have a few questions about some of the parts. Maybe you can help me with them.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Let me take a look. Hmm, this part here needs a little more detail.<p class=message>Really? I thought I was being too long-winded already.<p class="message sent">No, not at all. You have a way with words, but we just need to make sure the readers can visualize the scene.<p class=message>I see. Thank you for pointing that out. How about this other part?<p class="message sent">I think it's perfect. It has a good flow and it's easy to read.<p class=message>Great! That's a relief. What about the dialogue parts?<p class="message sent">They're fantastic. It feels like I'm sitting in the room with the characters. You're very good at creating conversations.<p class=message>Thank you, I appreciate it. So, when do you think we can have it published?<p class="message sent">Well, there's still some editing to be done. But we can start working on it soon. I'm excited about this, A. You have a best-seller in your hands.<p class=message>Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence. I couldn't have done it without your help.<p class="message sent">That's what I'm here for. Are you ready for another round of coffee?<p class=message>Absolutely. Let's take a break and enjoy the beautiful view while we're at it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bf512f4a-3ebd-4078-b6c9-f1352710b694.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
