They must have been really hungry.<p class=message>I don't know how they're going to finish all that food.<p class="message sent">Maybe they're planning on sharing with everyone in the office.<p class=message>That's a good point. At least we won't have to worry about going hungry later.<p class="message sent">I think we should join them next time and see how much food we can fit on one tray.<p class=message>Challenge accepted! But I'm not sure my stomach can handle all that food.<p class="message sent">It's worth a try. We can always share if we need to.<p class=message>I'm up for it, as long as we don't get indigestion.<p class="message sent">Deal. Let's plan on having a feast next time we hit the cafeteria.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. And who knows, maybe we'll inspire some coworkers to join us.<p class="message sent">We might just become the lunchtime legends of the office!<p class=message>Ha! I can see the headlines now: "Office mates tackle cafeteria buffet with gusto."<p class="message sent">We'll have to make sure to take a group photo for proof.<p class=message>And share it on the company's social media page. We'll be famous!<p class="message sent">Well, let's not get too carried away. But it'll definitely be a fun lunchtime adventure.<p class=message>Absolutely. I'm looking forward to it already.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed2077e6-9a9f-410e-b472-46ed63f75bc6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
