I'm excited to explore this fish market with you today.<p class="message sent">Good morning A! I'm glad you're here. This fish market is famous for its fresh and diverse seafood.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you have any suggestions as to what we should buy today?<p class="message sent">Well, we can't go wrong with some fresh tuna or squid. How about we also get some local shellfish and seaweed?<p class=message>Perfect. I've always wanted to learn how to cook with seaweed. Do you know any local recipes we can try?<p class="message sent">Yes, one of my favorite dishes is "kaisen-don", which is a seafood rice bowl topped with various types of sashimi and cooked seafood.<p class=message>That sounds amazing. Can you teach me how to make it?<p class="message sent">Of course. Let's head to my friend's cooking school and we can learn how to make it together.<p class=message>That's wonderful, thank you. By the way, what's your favorite seafood dish?<p class="message sent">I really love "tempura", which is a deep-fried seafood and vegetable dish. It's a classic Japanese dish.<p class=message>I see. I've had tempura before and it was delicious. Can you show me how to make it too?<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's actually quite easy, but the key is to use fresh ingredients and a light batter. You'll love it!<p class=message>I'm looking forward to it. This is such a great experience, learning about the local cuisine and cooking techniques from a local expert.<p class="message sent">I'm happy to share my knowledge with you, A. And who knows, maybe you'll become a master chef of Japanese cuisine one day.<p class=message>Haha, I doubt it, but I'll do my best. Thank you again for taking me on this food adventure, B.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. Let's get cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8731a9e4-2fb8-4f00-9c5e-48e579ce79ca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
