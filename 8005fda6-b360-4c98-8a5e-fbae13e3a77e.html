I'm trying to figure it out.<p class="message sent">Of course, my friend. It's all about managing risk and making sure that sensitive information stays secure.<p class=message>That sounds important. How can we apply it in our company?<p class="message sent">Well, we can start by identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities. Then, we can figure out how to either mitigate or accept the risk.<p class=message>So, if I understand correctly, we need to figure out what can go wrong and what we can do to prevent it, right?<p class="message sent">Exactly! We need to do a risk assessment and figure out which controls we need to implement to address the risks.<p class=message>Hmm, that sounds like a lot of work. What if we just ignore the risks and hope for the best?<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's not a good idea, my friend. Risk management is crucial, especially in today's digital age.<p class=message>(chuckles) You're right. Alright, let's get started. What's the first step?<p class="message sent">First, we need to identify all of the assets that need to be protected. This includes everything from hardware to software to data.<p class=message>Okay, got it. Then what?<p class="message sent">Next, we need to analyze the risks associated with each asset. This involves looking at different scenarios and determining the likelihood and impact of each risk.<p class=message>I see. And then what do we do?<p class="message sent">After we've analyzed the risks, we can develop a risk treatment plan. This plan will outline how we're going to address each risk and which controls we'll use.<p class=message>Wow, this is a lot of information to take in. But I'm excited to learn more about it.<p class="message sent">Great! It's important to take risk management seriously in order to protect our company and its stakeholders.<p class=message>Thanks for explaining it all to me, B. I feel more confident about this now.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. I'm always happy to help out a friend.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=80058fa5-bca5-47fe-8202-c14b5baf1bd3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
