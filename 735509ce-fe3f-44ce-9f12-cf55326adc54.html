Have you ever tried this fruit salad before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it good?<p class=message>It's amazing! The combination of fruits is perfect, and the dressing adds a nice tangy flavor.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. What kind of fruits are in it?<p class=message>There are strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, mango, and pineapple.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's quite a mix! Does it taste too sweet?<p class=message>Not at all, the fruits are naturally sweet and the dressing is balanced so it's not overpowering.<p class="message sent">I see. Do you think it's enough for a meal or just a snack?<p class=message>It could be a snack or a side dish, but I think I would need something more substantial for a meal.<p class="message sent">I agree. By the way, did you know that pineapples are a symbol of hospitality?<p class=message>Really? I had no idea. That's interesting.<p class="message sent">Yes, I learned it while traveling to Hawaii. They often present pineapples as a welcoming gesture.<p class=message>That's such a nice tradition. Maybe we should start doing that too when we have guests over.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And we should serve them this fruit salad, it's the perfect treat to share.<p class=message>Agreed. I'm glad we tried it, I'll definitely come back for more.<p class="message sent">Me too! It's a great alternative to dessert and it's healthy too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=73546694-c9e9-4ca2-8c62-7fb7a50ba9df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
