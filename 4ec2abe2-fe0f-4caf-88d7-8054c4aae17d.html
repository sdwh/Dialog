How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. I wanted to talk with you about our security measures.<p class="message sent">Sure, what's on your mind?<p class=message>I noticed that we have a lot of people coming in and out of the store without checking their bags.<p class="message sent">Yes, we do have a policy in place for checking bags but it's not always followed.<p class=message>Well, we should definitely make sure everyone entering the store is checked. It's for everyone's safety.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. We also need to make sure the entrance and exit doors are closed properly to prevent unauthorized access.<p class=message>Yes, that's important too. We should also have cameras installed at key locations.<p class="message sent">We actually do have cameras installed, but we can always reposition them based on customer flow.<p class=message>That's good to know. We also need to make sure that the emergency exits are not blocked and can be easily accessed in case of an emergency.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We have monthly safety drills to ensure our employees are familiar with the safety protocols.<p class=message>That's great. It's important to have a plan and be prepared. Thank you for discussing this with me.<p class="message sent">Anytime. Thank you for bringing it up. We want our customers and employees to feel safe and secure while shopping and working here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4ebb19ed-9a8a-42df-bd6a-eaf662338983.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
