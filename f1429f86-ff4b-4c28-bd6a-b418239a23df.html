It's pretty tough today.<p class=message>Oh no, do you need help with anything?<p class="message sent">Actually, can you explain to me how to find the area of a triangle again?<p class=message>Sure thing! Remember, it's just base times height divided by two.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I remember now. Thanks mom!<p class=message>No problem, anytime. So, how was your day at school today?<p class="message sent">It was okay, we did a fun science experiment in class.<p class=message>That sounds cool! What was the experiment about?<p class="message sent">We made our own volcanoes and watched them erupt.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. Did you get to make a mess?<p class="message sent">Of course! It was pretty messy but that's what made it so much fun.<p class=message>Haha, sounds like a blast. Alright sweetie, let me know if you need any more help with your homework.<p class="message sent">Thanks, mom. I think I'm good now. I'll let you know if anything comes up.<p class=message>Sounds good. Don't forget to take a break and relax when you need to.<p class="message sent">Will do, mom. Thanks again for your help!<p class=message>Anytime, dear. Now, let's go make some dinner together.
