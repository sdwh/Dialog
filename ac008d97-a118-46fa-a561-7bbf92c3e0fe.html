Welcome to the Statue of Liberty! Are you excited to take some pictures?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! This is my first time in New York and I can't wait to see the Statue of Liberty up close.<p class=message>That's great to hear! It's definitely a great experience to see the statue in person. So, where are you from?<p class="message sent">I'm from Spain! It's been a dream of mine to come and visit New York City for as long as I can remember.<p class=message>Well, I'm glad you're finally here! Let's get started with the pictures. Do you want to take some with your phone or with a camera?<p class="message sent">I have my camera with me, so I'll use that.<p class=message>Perfect. Just let me know if you want me to take any pictures for you. And if you have any questions about the statue or the history, feel free to ask.<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm curious, why is the Statue of Liberty green?<p class=message>Ah, that's a good question! The statue is made of copper, and over time it has oxidized and created a patina, which is what gives it that green color.<p class="message sent">That's really interesting! I didn't know that. Thank you for telling me.<p class=message>You're welcome! It's always fun sharing some interesting facts about the statue. Okay, let's take some pictures! Strike a pose and smile!<p class="message sent">Okay! How about one with the whole statue in the background and then a close-up?<p class=message>Great idea! Let's get some shots with the water and skyline in the background too. And maybe one with you pretending to hold up the torch?<p class="message sent">Yes! That would be so cool. Thank you for helping me get some great pictures.<p class=message>No problem at all. I'm happy to help! Just remember, if you want to climb up to the crown, you need to buy tickets in advance.<p class="message sent">I'll keep that in mind for next time. Thanks again for everything!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=abfa9c44-07d1-4d6c-a55f-b5c5221dc4f2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
