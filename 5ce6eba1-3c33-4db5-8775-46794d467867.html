Have you tried using a linter?<p class="message sent">Oh, good idea! Let me try that now.<p class=message>Perfect, let me know if you find anything. In the meantime, I'll check if there are any relevant solutions in Github.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Hey, have you heard about that new programming language that's gaining popularity?<p class=message>You mean Rust? Yeah, I've read some interesting things about it.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's the one! I'm thinking of learning it on the side. Want to join me?<p class=message>Absolutely! Always down to expand the skillset.<p class="message sent">Great! Oh, by the way, have you tried that new cafe down the street? Their coffee is amazing.<p class=message>Really? I haven't yet, but I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem! We could even have a coding session there sometime.<p class=message>Haha, now that's what I call a "coffee code" session.<p class="message sent">I like the sound of that. We'll have to make it happen soon!<p class=message>Definitely. Hey, looks like you found the issue with the code. Nice work!<p class="message sent">Yeah, it was just a minor syntax error. All fixed now.<p class=message>Awesome, let's commit and push the changes to Github. Another successful coding session!<p class="message sent">Agreed. Great work, A.<p class=message>Same to you, B. Until the next one!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ce4193a-c5ba-401b-b83f-c0b74acf2e58.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
