I'm a food critic and I must say, I'm very excited to try out your food stall. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Hi! Welcome to my humble food stall. I highly recommend our specialty - the fried rice noodles with beef and egg. It's one of our bestsellers!<p class=message>Sounds delicious! I'll have one of those, please.<p class="message sent">Great choice! I'll prepare that for you right away. While you're waiting, I recommend trying our deep-fried spring rolls. They're the perfect appetizer!<p class=message>Sure thing. I'll try some of those as well. So, how long have you been running this food stall?<p class="message sent">Oh, we've been here for over 10 years now. It's a family-run business and our recipes have been passed down for generations.<p class=message>That's amazing. You must have some secret family recipes that make your food stand out.<p class="message sent">Indeed we do. Our secret weapon is our homemade chili sauce. It adds that extra kick to all of our dishes.<p class=message>Wow, I can't wait to try it. Here's the fried rice noodles, it smells amazing.<p class="message sent">I hope you enjoy it! Let me know what you think.<p class=message>Mmm, this is delicious! The beef is so tender and the egg adds a nice touch. And the homemade chili sauce is the perfect addition.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it! Here are the spring rolls. Be careful, they're hot!<p class=message>These are crispy and flavorful. I can definitely see why they're so popular.<p class="message sent">Well, I'm always happy to see a satisfied customer. Is there anything else you'd like to try?<p class=message>Hmm, how about your bubble tea? Do you make that in-house as well?<p class="message sent">Yes we do! Our bubble tea is also very popular. Would you like to try our classic milk tea or a fruity tea?<p class=message>I'll try the classic milk tea. Thank you for your recommendation.<p class="message sent">No problem. Here's your bubble tea. I hope you enjoy it!<p class=message>It's sweet and creamy, just the way I like it. Thank you for a wonderful meal and experience.<p class="message sent">Thank you for stopping by and trying out our food. We always appreciate feedback from food critics like yourself.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ac791858-2eac-4d8e-9adb-519f96a77ace.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
