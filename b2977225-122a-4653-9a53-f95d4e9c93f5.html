How about you?<p class=message>Same here, I'm actually getting pretty comfortable using Node.js.<p class="message sent">Nice, I remember struggling with it when I first started.<p class=message>Yeah, it was a bit tricky at first but after some practice, it's starting to make sense.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. What's the latest project you're working on?<p class=message>I'm actually building a chatbot for a client. It's been a fun challenge.<p class="message sent">Oh cool, I've always been interested in chatbots. What platform are you using?<p class=message>I'm using Facebook's Messenger platform. Have you ever built one before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had the chance yet. But I'd love to learn more about it sometime.<p class=message>Definitely, it's a pretty interesting field right now. Chatbots are becoming more and more prevalent.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've noticed that too. It's amazing how technology is evolving.<p class=message>It really is. So, what are you currently working on?<p class="message sent">I'm debugging some code for a payment system we're building. It's been a bit frustrating, but I'm getting there.<p class=message>I feel you, debugging can be such a pain. But hey, at least it's keeping you on your toes.<p class="message sent">True, true. Gotta keep the brain engaged, right?<p class=message>Haha, absolutely. Well, good luck with that and let me know if you need any help.<p class="message sent">Will do, thanks. Same goes for you and that chatbot project.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b28f51a6-89a4-4cda-a9e6-4359c58508b2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
