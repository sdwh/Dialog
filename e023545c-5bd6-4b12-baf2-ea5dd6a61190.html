How's it going with the server management these days?<p class="message sent">Hey A, all good here, just trying to keep up with the ever-increasing demands.<p class=message>I know what you mean. It's a tough job trying to balance functionality and security. Speaking of which, I'm here for the ISO 27001 audit.<p class="message sent">Ah, the dreaded audit! Are you going to put me through the wringer?<p class=message>(laughs) Of course not, B. I'm just here to ensure that we are in compliance with the standards.<p class="message sent">Alright then, let's get started. What's first on the agenda?<p class=message>Well, I have a checklist here that we need to go through. It seems like the first thing we need to address is access control. Can you tell me a bit about the user access policy in place?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. We have a strict access policy that ensures each user has access only to what they need for their job. We also have a two-factor authentication process in place for added security.<p class=message>Great to hear that. What about data backups and disaster recovery?<p class="message sent">We have a robust backup system in place and also a disaster recovery plan ready for implementation in case of emergencies.<p class=message>Sounds like you're on top of things, B. Keep up the good work!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I appreciate your feedback. Is there anything else you need from me for the audit?<p class=message>Just a few more things, but we can discuss them over lunch. How about we grab some sushi at that new place down the street?<p class="message sent">I'm game, A. Let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e0234fdd-3e62-42d8-864c-1b75443933bc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
