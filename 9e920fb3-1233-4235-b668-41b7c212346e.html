It's located near Central Park, right?<p class="message sent">Of course, that's a great spot. We'll be passing by the park on the way there. Are you planning on spending some time there?<p class=message>Actually, I wasn't planning to, but it's a beautiful day today. Maybe I will take a quick walk through the park.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. The park is lovely this time of year.<p class=message>What else would we be passing by on the way there?<p class="message sent">Well, on the other side of the theater, across the street, there's a pretty cool museum. Have you been there before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What kind of museum is it?<p class="message sent">It's an art museum, with some really interesting and unique pieces. They have a great exhibit on the top floor.<p class=message>Hmm, maybe I'll have to check that out too. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class="message sent">Not a problem at all. I always try to share some local spots with my passengers.<p class=message>It's great to have a local's perspective. Have you lived in this city for a long time?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, my whole life. I've seen a lot of changes over the years, but I still love this city just as much as when I was a kid.<p class=message>I bet you have some great stories.<p class="message sent">Oh, I definitely do. One time, I even drove a celebrity to the airport.<p class=message>No way, who was it?<p class="message sent">I probably shouldn't say, but let's just say it was someone really famous.<p class=message>Ah, come on, you can't leave me hanging like that.<p class="message sent">Alright, alright. It was none other thanâ€¦ Oprah Winfrey.<p class=message>Wow, that's amazing. What was that like?<p class="message sent">It was pretty surreal, to be honest. But at the end of the day, celebrities are just people like you and me.<p class=message>Very true. Well, we're almost there. Thanks for the ride and the great conversation.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Enjoy the theater and the museum, and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e9086d1-6d04-4fb2-af23-d8851ca75149.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
