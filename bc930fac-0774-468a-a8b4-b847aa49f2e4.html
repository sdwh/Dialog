How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey A! I'm doing well, thanks.<p class=message>Great to hear! So, I heard you had some interesting findings during the source code review?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I found some vulnerabilities in the authentication process.<p class=message>That's worth looking into. Did you already come up with a fix?<p class="message sent">I haven't yet, but I have some ideas on how to address it.<p class=message>Awesome, let's hear it! Two heads are better than one.<p class="message sent">I was thinking of implementing a stronger password policy and adding multi-factor authentication.<p class=message>Those are great suggestions. Have you checked if our system can actually support those changes?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I already ran some tests and everything seems to be working fine.<p class=message>Excellent! Let's schedule a meeting with the team to discuss this further.<p class="message sent">Sounds good! By the way, have you heard about the new AI tool for code review?<p class=message>You mean the one that claims to find code-related issues faster and more accurately?<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's the one. I'm planning to give it a try to see if it's actually effective.<p class=message>That's a good idea. Let me know how it goes.<p class="message sent">Will do. Oh, and by the way, have you watched the latest episode of Black Mirror?<p class=message>Not yet. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">It's fantastic! You should definitely watch it.<p class=message>I'll add it to my to-watch list. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem. Anyway, let's get back to work. Talk to you soon, A!<p class=message>Sure thing. Catch you later, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bc925eed-7603-41f2-8129-4c0f31a349ce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
