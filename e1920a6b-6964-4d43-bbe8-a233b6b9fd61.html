How about you?<p class=message>Same here. I found a bug in my code after a thorough source code inspection.<p class="message sent">Oh no! Did you manage to fix it?<p class=message>Yeah, I did. It wasn't a big deal. It was just a small syntax error.<p class="message sent">It's always the small things that cause the most problems.<p class=message>Tell me about it. By the way, what tool do you use for source code analysis?<p class="message sent">I use SonarQube. It's a great tool for detecting vulnerabilities and bugs in the code.<p class=message>I use it too. It's pretty awesome. What's your process for fixing the issues you find?<p class="message sent">First, I review the code and understand the root cause of the issue. Then, I come up with a solution and test it thoroughly before committing it.<p class=message>That sounds like a good process. I follow a similar process myself. I like to make sure my code is rock solid.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's important. I've seen some people rush through code reviews and end up causing more problems.<p class=message>Definitely. It's better to take a little more time and get it right the first time.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And if we still miss something, we'll catch it in the next review.<p class=message>That's the spirit. It's always better to catch an issue early on before it becomes a bigger problem.<p class="message sent">You got that right. Alright, back to work. Nice chatting with you.<p class=message>Likewise, talk to you later.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e17f5d88-f30f-4d12-b585-c602204942a3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
