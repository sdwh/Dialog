Can you please take me to Kaohsiung?<p class="message sent">Good morning, ma'am! Yes, of course. You seem like you're in a hurry.<p class=message>Yes, I have to attend a friend's wedding this afternoon. I hope we'll get there on time.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, ma'am. I'll take you there as quickly and safely as possible. By the way, do you like music?<p class=message>Yes, I do.

How about Queen?<p class="message sent">Oh, I love Queen! Freddie Mercury was one of the best frontmen in rock history!<p class=message>I couldn't agree more! What do you think of their song "Bohemian Rhapsody"?<p class="message sent">It's a masterpiece, one of the greatest songs ever written. And the movie about Freddie Mercury was superb.<p class=message>I haven't seen it yet, but I've heard many good things about it.<p class="message sent">You should definitely watch it. Anyway, we're almost there. Is this your first time in Kaohsiung?<p class=message>No, it isn't. I've been here a few times, but I still find it a fascinating city.<p class="message sent">Yes, it has a lot to offer. And it's known for its night markets and street food. Have you tried any of them?<p class=message>Yes, I have. The food here is amazing. My favorite is the papaya milkshake.<p class="message sent">That's one of the best drinks in Kaohsiung. And now, we've arrived!<p class=message>Thank you so much for the great conversation and for getting me here on time. Here's the fare and a little extra for being so friendly.<p class="message sent">You're very welcome. Have a great time at the wedding, ma'am.
