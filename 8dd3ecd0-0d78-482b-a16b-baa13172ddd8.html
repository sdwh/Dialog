How's your day going, driver?<p class="message sent">Good morning! It's going well, thanks for asking. How about yours?<p class=message>Can't complain! So, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Oh, about 10 years now. It's a pretty interesting job, you get to meet all sorts of people.<p class=message>I bet! What's the craziest thing that's ever happened to you while driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">Oh, let me think... One time, I had a couple getting into a heated argument, and the next thing I know, the guy proposed to the girl in the back seat! It was quite the surprise.<p class=message>Wow, that's wild! Speaking of surprises, have you ever had to deal with an unexpected detour while driving a passenger?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. One time, there was a parade blocking my usual route, so I had to take a different route that ended up being a lot longer. Luckily, the passenger was understanding about it.<p class=message>That's good to hear. So, do you have any favorite spots in New York you like to recommend to visitors?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. You gotta check out Times Square and Central Park. They're classic tourist spots, but for good reason.<p class=message>Yeah, I'll be sure to do that. Thanks for the tip. Hey, have you ever had any famous people ride in your taxi?<p class="message sent">Actually, yeah! One time, I drove a well-known actress to a Broadway show. She was very friendly and down-to-earth.<p class=message>That's so cool! Well, I think we're almost at our destination. Thanks for the great ride and conversation, driver.<p class="message sent">No problem! Thanks for choosing my taxi. Have a great day in the city!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8dd25afa-6c29-4baf-a1ca-e18bed4119b1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
