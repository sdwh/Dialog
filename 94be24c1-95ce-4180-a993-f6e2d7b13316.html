Long time no see. How's everything going with the software development?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! All is well. We've been making some great progress on the codebase.<p class=message>That's great to hear. How's the security aspect of the codebase looking?<p class="message sent">We've been doing regular scans and have found a few vulnerabilities that need to be patched up. It's been quite a process, but we're getting there.<p class=message>Yeah, source code scanning can take up some time, but it's important to keep those vulnerabilities at bay. What kind of vulnerabilities did you come across?<p class="message sent">We found some buffer overflows, SQL injections, and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, to name a few.<p class=message>Ah, those are pretty common ones. Did you manage to fix them all?<p class="message sent">Yes, we've fixed most of them so far. We even rewrote some parts of the codebase to ensure that vulnerabilities are detected earlier in the development process.<p class=message>That's awesome! It's really important to have security integrated into the development process itself.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, we've been following the DevSecOps approach for this project. It's been quite a journey, but we're getting there.<p class=message>Well, keep up the good work, B! Hopefully, the software will be secure and ready for deployment soon.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! We're almost there. After this, maybe we can grab a drink and celebrate?<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Looking forward to it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=94bd9c61-031c-46ad-bd32-0dd03dbc0525.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
