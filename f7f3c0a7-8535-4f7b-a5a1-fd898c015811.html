I'm a foodie and I'm curious about French cuisine. Can you tell me more about what kind of dishes do you serve here?<p class="message sent">Of course! Our restaurant specializes in French cuisine. Our menu includes croissants, baguettes, escargot, Croque-Monsieur and foie gras among others.<p class=message>Wow! Sounds absolutely delicious. I've always been a fan of croissants, especially when they're freshly baked. Do you make them in-house?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do! Our croissants are baked fresh every morning, and they're so buttery and flaky. You can have them plain or with a variety of fillings.<p class=message>Yum! I'd love to try one with some jam or chocolate spread. And what about the baguettes? Are they crisp on the outside and fluffy inside?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Our baguettes are baked using traditional French methods, which give them that signature crusty exterior and soft center. They're perfect for pairing with cheese or dips.<p class=message>I'm sold! And what about the escargot? I've heard it's a French delicacy.<p class="message sent">Yes, it is! Our escargot is served with garlic butter and parsley, and it's always a hit with our customers. You should definitely give it a try if you haven't already.<p class=message>Oh, I will! And what about the Croque-Monsieur and foie gras?<p class="message sent">Our Croque-Monsieur is a classic French sandwich made with ham and cheese, and it's served with a side salad. Our foie gras is a rich and creamy pâté that's perfect for spreading on toast or crackers.<p class=message>Wow, everything sounds so delicious! I can't wait to try it all. Thank you so much for telling me about your menu.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure! We take pride in our French cuisine and love sharing it with our customers. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f7ef19f9-011c-48aa-b365-8798cb5d130a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
