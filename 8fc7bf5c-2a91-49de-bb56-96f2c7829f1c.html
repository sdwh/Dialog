Can I get you anything to drink?<p class="message sent">Umm, just a glass of water would be great.<p class=message>Sure thing. So, can you tell me why you’re here today?<p class="message sent">Well, I guess you caught me red-handed. I was caught shoplifting at the mall.<p class=message>I see. What did you steal exactly?<p class="message sent">Just a few small things, really. Some candy, a magazine, and a toy car.<p class=message>Hmm, well, that’s not too serious. However, stealing is still a crime. Do you have an explanation as to why you did it?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I wasn’t really thinking. I just saw the items and thought it would be easy to grab and go.<p class=message>I understand, but it’s important to think before you act. Now, will you be able to pay for the items you stole?<p class="message sent">Yes, I can pay for them. I didn’t mean for this to happen.<p class=message>I’m glad to hear that. Let me just write up a citation for you to sign stating that you acknowledge the theft and will pay for the items. Do you have any questions for me?<p class="message sent">No, not really. Just give me the fine so I can pay it and be done with this.<p class=message>Alright, I’ll get that for you. Thank you for cooperating.<p class="message sent">Thank you for being kind and understanding.<p class=message>No problem, it’s all part of the job. Take care and have a good day.<p class="message sent">You too, Officer.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8fc6f0d7-aedc-4a7f-aee5-2f7fe934a9a7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
