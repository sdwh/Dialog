How's everything going with the system?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. Everything is going smoothly here so far. What brings you here today?<p class=message>I'm here to conduct an ISO 27001 audit. Is now a good time for us to talk about it?<p class="message sent">Sure, let's get started. (laughs) Just bear with me if I start speaking in IT jargon, I'm so used to it.<p class=message>That's no problem for me. It's actually a plus to have a knowledgeable person to speak to about these things.<p class="message sent">Okay then. By the way, do you have a background in IT? Or do you just specialize in ISO?<p class=message>I know a few things about IT, but I mainly focus on the ISO standards. Luckily, with your help, I can understand the IT part more.<p class="message sent">I'm glad I can be of help then. Otherwise, this can become a boring and lonely task.<p class=message>(laughing) Oh, nobody said that an audit can't be fun. In fact, I'm enjoying our conversation so far.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear! We should definitely have more audits together in the future then.<p class=message>(smiling) I couldn't agree more. But first, let's finish today's tasks. Can I ask you some questions regarding the access controls?<p class="message sent">(nodding) Of course. Fire away!<p class=message>(clearing throat) Firstly, how do you manage the authentication and authorization of your users?<p class="message sent">(explaining) We use a two-factor authentication process and grant access rights based on job roles.<p class=message>(impressed) That sounds secure and efficient. Do you have any protocols in case of security threats?<p class="message sent">(serious tone) Yes, we have an incident response plan that we review and update regularly.<p class=message>(nodding) Excellent. That shows that your team takes security seriously. Okay then, last question, promise. Can you show me your backup and recovery plan?<p class="message sent">(smiling) I can definitely do that. I'll show you the process we have in place, which I assure you, is thorough.<p class=message>(grinning) Great! I have no doubt about that. Thanks, B, for your time and for making this audit less tedious.<p class="message sent">(smiling) My pleasure, A. It was a pleasure having this chat with you too. We definitely make a great team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b09b632a-573a-4f60-b320-1f9553976ad7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
