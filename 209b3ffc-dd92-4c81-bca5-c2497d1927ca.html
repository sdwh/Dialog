What can I do for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I need a haircut, but I'm not sure what style to go for.<p class=message>No problem. We have plenty of magazines and books with pictures of different cuts. Have a seat and take a look.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'll do that. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Well, based on the shape of your face, I think a shorter cut on the sides and longer on the top would look great.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's do that then.<p class=message>Great choice! Would you like any product in your hair, like gel or wax?<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe a little bit of wax to keep the style in place.<p class=message>Sure thing. I'm going to start by washing your hair, so lean back and relax.<p class="message sent">Ahh, this feels amazing. I could fall asleep.<p class=message>You wouldn't be the first! Some of my clients doze off during the shampoo.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well, I'll try to stay awake.<p class=message>(laughs) No worries. I'm almost done. Now, let's get started on the cut.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Do you have any interesting stories from your time as a barber?<p class=message>(laughs) Oh, plenty. But one of my favorites is when a client fell asleep and woke up with hair missing on one side of his head!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Oh no. I hope that never happens to me.<p class=message>Don't worry, it won't. We're almost finished here. How do you like your new cut?<p class="message sent">It looks fantastic, thank you! I'll definitely be coming back.<p class=message>Glad to hear it. Thanks for coming in and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=209b2bda-87c1-4c83-84d7-dfd55365bf38.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
