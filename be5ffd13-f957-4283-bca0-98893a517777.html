What kind of bread are you making today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! We have our usual sourdough and baguettes. And we've introduced a new multigrain bread.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting. How does it taste?<p class="message sent">Itâ€™s a bit nutty with a mix of sesame, sunflower, and pumpkin seeds. Would you like to try it?<p class=message>Yes, please! And I'll also have a cappuccino.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Would you like me to have it here or to go?<p class=message>I'll have it to go, please. I'm on my way to work.<p class="message sent">Alright. Your coffee will be ready in just a few minutes. So, what kind of bread do you normally prefer?<p class=message>I really like sourdough bread. It has a distinct flavor that goes well with different toppings.<p class="message sent">I agree. And did you know that sourdough bread is easier to digest than regular bread?<p class=message>Really? I did not know that. Thanks for the tip!<p class="message sent">No problem. There's always something new to learn about bread and coffee.<p class=message>Speaking of coffee, do you have any new blends or flavors?<p class="message sent">We just got a shipment of single-origin beans from Ethiopia. It has a really fruity and floral taste.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds exotic. I might have to try that next time.<p class="message sent">Definitely do. It's a limited edition, so it won't be here forever.<p class=message>Thanks for letting me know. Here's my payment. Keep the change.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much. Have a great day at work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=be553585-810c-432f-9975-d97e9ae07489.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
