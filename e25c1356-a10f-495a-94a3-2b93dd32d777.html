Have you found anything interesting?<p class=message>Actually, I just started checking out this new training center that offers exam prep courses for a bunch of different certifications. Have you heard of it?<p class="message sent">Hmm, not sure. What's the name of the place?<p class=message>It's called CertifyMe Academy. They have courses for everything from PMP to Six Sigma.<p class="message sent">Oh cool, I've been thinking about getting my PMP certification. How are the instructors there?<p class=message>So far, they seem really knowledgeable and experienced. They also provide a ton of prep materials and practice exams.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. What's the schedule like for the courses?<p class=message>You can either take the courses in person or online, and they have sessions in both the daytime and evening.<p class="message sent">That's convenient. How much does it cost?<p class=message>It's a bit on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it for the quality of the training. Plus, they offer a money-back guarantee if you don't pass the exam.<p class="message sent">Hmm, sounds like a good investment. Have you signed up for a course yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm thinking about signing up for the Six Sigma course next month. Want to join me?<p class="message sent">Sure, why not? I've heard that Six Sigma is really valuable in the job market these days.<p class=message>Definitely. And if we both pass the exam, we can celebrate with some well-deserved drinks!<p class="message sent">Ha, sounds like a plan. Cheers to our future certifications!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e25a9e0a-757c-45bb-8a19-10521ab39cb9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
