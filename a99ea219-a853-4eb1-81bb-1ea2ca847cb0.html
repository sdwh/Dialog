How's everything in the World of Warcraft treating you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing pretty well, thanks for asking. Just finished up a raid with my guildmates.<p class=message>Nice, got any loot to show off?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, no. RNG wasn't on my side this time.<p class=message>Ah, the joys of random number generators. Speaking of loot, have you seen the new transmog options in the latest patch?<p class="message sent">Yeah, there are some really cool pieces. I'm currently working on getting the full set of the new shaman gear.<p class=message>Sounds like a fun challenge. I'm hoping to snag the new mounts that were added. Have you seen them?<p class="message sent">Yeah, they look awesome. I'm not much of a mount collector myself, but I might have to make an exception for those.<p class=message>Haha, I know the feeling. I swear, cosmetics are more addictive than actual gameplay sometimes.<p class="message sent">Ain't that the truth. Speaking of cosmetics, have you seen the new dance emotes they added for each race?<p class=message>Yes! I've been having so much fun trying them all out. Although I must admit, my orc looks a bit silly trying to do the Night Elf dance.<p class="message sent">Hey, it's all about embracing your character's eccentricities. My gnome looks ridiculous doing any of the dances, but I love it all the same.<p class=message>Haha, fair enough. It's all part of the fun. So, what are your plans for the rest of the day in Azeroth?<p class="message sent">Just some dailies and maybe a few battlegrounds. You?<p class=message>I'm thinking of trying out a new quest chain I saw on the forums. Might also hit up the auction house and do some shuffling.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a solid plan. Alright, I'll catch you later. For the Horde!<p class=message>Lok'tar ogar!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a9987c71-e06b-4eba-8e1d-3c402402a9fc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
