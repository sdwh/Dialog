I'm a tea enthusiast and I'm looking for some high-quality tea leaves to brew at home. Can you help me with that?<p class="message sent">Of course! As a professional roaster, I know a thing or two about tea. What type of tea are you interested in?<p class=message>I'm specifically looking for some premium green tea from Japan. What do you have in stock?<p class="message sent">We have a few options that might suit your taste. There's sencha, gyokuro, and matcha. Have you tried any of those before?<p class=message>Yes, I'm familiar with sencha and matcha. But I've never tried gyokuro before. Could you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Gyokuro is a type of shaded green tea that's grown in Japan. It has a distinct sweetness and umami flavor. It's also quite expensive compared to other green teas because of the specific growing process.<p class=message>That sounds interesting! Let me try some of that. Do you also have some recommendations for pairing it with food?<p class="message sent">Sure! Gyokuro pairs well with light dishes like sushi and sashimi. It's also great with desserts like fruit tarts and white chocolate.<p class=message>Perfect! And what about brewing instructions?<p class="message sent">For gyokuro, it's important to use lower temperature water, around 50-60Â°C, and steep for only a minute or two. This will ensure the tea doesn't become too bitter.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice! I'll definitely try that at home. Could you also package some of the tea leaves for me to take home?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! How many grams would you like?<p class=message>I'll take 50 grams, please.<p class="message sent">Great choice! And just so you know, we also have some great teapots and accessories that could enhance your brewing experience at home.<p class=message>That's good to know. I'll have a look before I go. Thanks for all your help!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Enjoy your tea, and don't hesitate to come back if you have any other questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b697891b-bd8d-41ce-9211-7910f84ec968.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
