How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I'm doing well, thank you. What can I get for you today?<p class=message>I'm actually the pastry chef here. I need some ingredients for the desserts I'm making.<p class="message sent">Oh, sorry about that! What ingredients do you need?<p class=message>I need some heavy cream, sugar, and fresh berries. Do you have those?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do! How much of each would you like?<p class=message>Just enough for a dozen mini cakes.<p class="message sent">Alright, that'll be just a moment. Would you like something to drink while you wait?<p class=message>Sure, I'll have a latte with almond milk, please.<p class="message sent">Coming right up! So, how long have you been a pastry chef?<p class=message>I've been baking since I was a kid, but I've been a professional pastry chef for about 10 years now.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive! What's your favorite dessert to make?<p class=message>That's a tough question. I love making anything with chocolate, but I also love experimenting with different flavors and textures.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious! I'm a big fan of chocolate myself. Do you have any recommendations on the menu for me?<p class=message>Definitely try our chocolate ganache tart if you haven't already. It's rich and decadent.<p class="message sent">Oh, that does sound amazing. Thanks for the recommendation! So, what brought you to Edinburgh?<p class=message>I came for a pastry chef position at this shop actually. I've been enjoying the city and the people here.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! Edinburgh is a beautiful city. Here's your latte and the ingredients you asked for.<p class=message>Fantastic! Thank you so much. I'll get started on those mini cakes now.<p class="message sent">No problem, it was nice chatting with you. Have a great day and happy baking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=74ce9b4c-fa02-4fdb-beec-3ed0584d9951.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
