I'll take you to the electronic store tomorrow.<p class=message>Yes! Thank you so much.<p class="message sent">But just to clarify, you do mean the gaming console and not a regular switch, right?<p class=message>Of course, I mean the gaming console. Why would I want a regular switch?<p class="message sent">Well, I had a friend once who asked for a switch, and when he got home he found out it was a Cisco Switch. He was pretty disappointed.<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious, but don't worry, I promise you I want the Nintendo Switch.<p class="message sent">Ok, just making sure. We don't want to end up with a piece of networking equipment instead of a gaming console.<p class=message>(giggles) I can't believe your friend got a Cisco Switch instead of a Nintendo Switch.<p class="message sent">Yeah, poor guy. He was quite confused and couldn't figure out why he couldn't play any games on it.<p class=message>(laughs) I can imagine. But don't worry, I'll make sure we get the right thing.<p class="message sent">Great, I trust you. But just in case, let's double-check with the store employee that we're getting the right thing.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I can't wait to play Mario Kart on the Nintendo Switch!<p class="message sent">Me too, kiddo. It's going to be a blast.<p class=message>And don't worry, I won't let you accidentally buy a Cisco Switch instead.<p class="message sent">(smiles) I appreciate that. You're a wonderful assistant, kid.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f003aa25-d4e2-4b9f-8cf2-b51a3eff819e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
