What is the make and model of your vehicle, A?<p class=message>It's a Toyota Camry.<p class="message sent">Great! And what is the odometer reading on your car?<p class=message>Let me check...it says 38,000 miles.<p class="message sent">Perfect, that's what we have on record as well. Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>Actually, yes. I just took a road trip with my family and we played a game to guess the total mileage we would drive. Care to guess?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. How long was the trip?<p class=message>It was about 900 miles.<p class="message sent">I'll guess 932 miles - a little bit over. How close was I?<p class=message>Not bad at all! We actually ended up driving 925 miles. You're a good guesser, B.<p class="message sent">Haha, just a lucky guess. It sounds like you had a great road trip with your family, though.<p class=message>We did, it was a lot of fun. Thanks for your help with the mileage confirmation and for indulging me in my little guessing game.<p class="message sent">Of course, always happy to assist our customers. Have a great day, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6a3e5ae7-72a6-4cc5-945c-dd9247f4621d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
