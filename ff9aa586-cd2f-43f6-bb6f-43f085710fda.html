Maybe we should try to cut back a bit.<p class=message>But what if I still get a toothache even if I don't eat candy?<p class="message sent">It's possible, but there are other things that can cause toothaches too. Maybe we should make a dentist appointment just to be sure.<p class=message>But I don't want to go to the dentist!<p class="message sent">I know it's not always fun, but taking care of our teeth is important. The dentist can help us figure out how to make sure our teeth stay healthy.<p class=message>Okay... but can we still have some candy every once in a while?<p class="message sent">Of course! It's all about moderation. We just need to make sure we're not eating too much sugar all the time.<p class=message>Okay, I'll try to be better about that. But can we still have ice cream tonight?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yes, we can still have ice cream tonight. One treat every now and then is okay as long as we take care of our teeth in the long run.<p class=message>Okay, thanks daddy. You're the best!<p class="message sent">Anything for my little sweet tooth.
