You gotta be kidding me. How is that even possible?<p class=message>It's called AIr. HAHA! Get it? AI + Air.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's terrible. But speaking of AI, have you worked with any machine learning libraries in Node.js?<p class=message>Yeah, I've used TensorFlow before. It's really powerful, but can be difficult to set up.<p class="message sent">Have you heard of Brain.js? It's a simpler alternative for smaller projects.<p class=message>No, I haven't. Can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Sure! It's a lightweight library that lets you implement neural networks in JS. Perfect for smaller tasks.<p class=message>That sounds really useful. I'll have to give it a try. Speaking of smaller tasks, have you ever worked with cron jobs in Node.js?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. They're great for scheduling tasks that need to happen automatically at certain times.<p class=message>I agree. I once set up a cron job to send me an email reminder to stretch every 30 minutes. My back was really grateful.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Hey, we need to take care of our bodies, especially with all the sitting we do.<p class=message>Yeah, we need to remind ourselves to move around more. Maybe we should set up a cron job to remind us to take a break and go for a walk every hour.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's a great idea. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=53447f88-55d0-4851-8d5e-573596ff4839.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
