How are you doing?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. What brings you here today?<p class=message>So, I heard you're working on a new desktop game. What's it all about?<p class="message sent">That's right! The game is called "Escape the Office". It's a multiplayer puzzle game where players have to solve clues and escape from an office within a certain time limit.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. How many players can play at once?<p class="message sent">Up to four players can play simultaneously, making it a great game for friends or families to play together.<p class=message>Nice! And I'm guessing you've added some cool features to the game?<p class="message sent">Of course! We have added some unique puzzles and a variety of different office work-themed obstacles, so players really feel like they are trying to escape from the office.<p class=message>Can't wait to give it a try! When will it be released?<p class="message sent">We're planning to launch it in a few months. But before that, we want to make sure everything is perfect and that people have an amazing experience playing it.<p class=message>That's great. I'm sure you'll have a lot of fans waiting for it.<p class="message sent">We sure hope so! It's been a lot of work, but we're really proud of the game we've created.<p class=message>I know I'll be one of those fans waiting for it to come out. Thanks for telling me all about it, B.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. It's always great to share our work with others. Thanks for being interested!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f1f27f5e-cbdc-4c67-ae24-9125c70659c0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
