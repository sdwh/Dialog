Especially with all the new threats that pop up every day.<p class=message>Absolutely. But we have to stay on top of it to protect our clients' financial information.<p class="message sent">Couldn't agree more. That's why we have multifactor authentication and encryption, among other things.<p class=message>Right, and we constantly monitor for any suspicious activity.<p class="message sent">It's a good thing we have a great team working on this.<p class=message>Definitely. By the way, have you heard about the latest phishing scams?<p class="message sent">Yeah, those are pretty nasty. We need to educate our clients on how to spot them.<p class=message>That's true. And we also need to make sure our employees are trained on how to avoid falling for them.<p class="message sent">Speaking of employees, we should also have a strict password policy and limit access to sensitive data.<p class=message>Great point. And we need to ensure that all software and systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.<p class="message sent">Plus, we should perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify any vulnerabilities.<p class=message>It's a lot of work, but it's worth it to keep our clients safe.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And it's a team effort. We need everyone in the company to be aware and proactive about security.<p class=message>Agreed. Thanks for the chat, B. I'm feeling more motivated to tackle these security challenges now.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. We're in this together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=92b73817-5bd8-44d3-bb40-1f6073a1a3ea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
