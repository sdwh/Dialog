Can you explain the process to me?<p class="message sent">Hi! Of course, I'd be happy to help. What kind of event are you planning?<p class=message>We're a small team of five, and we need a room to discuss some business ideas.<p class="message sent">Great! We have a few conference rooms of different sizes. How many hours will you be needing the room?<p class=message>We'll need it for three hours.<p class="message sent">That should work perfectly. As for equipment, would you like us to provide a projector and screen?<p class=message>That would be helpful, thanks. How much does it cost?<p class="message sent">The price for the room and equipment for three hours is $150. Is that within your budget?<p class=message>Yes, that works. Can we bring in our own food and drinks?<p class="message sent">We do have catering services available, but you are welcome to bring in your own food and drinks if you prefer.<p class=message>Okay, great. What time can we access the room?<p class="message sent">Our conference rooms are available starting at 8am. Is that convenient for you?<p class=message>Yes, that's perfect. Can you reserve the room for us?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, I'll need your name and contact information to make the reservation.<p class=message>My name is Lisa and my phone number is 111-222-3333.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Lisa. You're all set. Is there anything else you need from us?<p class=message>No, that's all.
