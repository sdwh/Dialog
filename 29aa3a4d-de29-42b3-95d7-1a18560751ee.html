How can I assist you with your travel plans today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm interested in visiting some of the historical sites in Washington D.C., particularly the Capitol Hill.<p class=message>Excellent choice! The Capitol is a must-visit attraction. Would you like to take a guided tour or explore on your own?<p class="message sent">I think I would like to take a guided tour to get a better understanding of the historical significance of the building.<p class=message>Great! We can arrange for a guided tour that will take you to the Senate and House Galleries where you can watch the congressional proceedings.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! How much time should I set aside for the tour?<p class=message>The guided tour usually takes about an hour and a half. But with the current pandemic situation, it might take a bit longer due to the safety measures.<p class="message sent">Okay. Is there anything else I can do on Capitol Hill, or nearby that is worth visiting?<p class=message>Yes, you could also visit the Library of Congress or the United States Supreme Court. They are located nearby and easily accessible.<p class="message sent">Wow, I did not know that they were so close. Do I need a reservation or ticket to enter those buildings?<p class=message>No, entry to the Library of Congress and the Supreme Court is free of charge. However, if you would like to have a guided tour, you need to reserve a spot in advance.<p class="message sent">That's very helpful to know. Thank you so much for your assistance!<p class=message>You're welcome! Have a great time touring the Capitol and the other historical sites in our lovely city.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=29a8e645-027e-4b89-9fd5-d9aa487ede5c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
