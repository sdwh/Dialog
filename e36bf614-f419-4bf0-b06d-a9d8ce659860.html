Ready for the lunch rush?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm managing alright. How about you? Is everything prepped and ready to go?<p class=message>Oh yeah, I've got all the meats in the smoker and the sides are hot and fresh. Speaking of which, have you tried the new mac and cheese recipe I made?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. Is it any good?<p class=message>Yeah, I added some bacon and jalape√±os for a little kick. It's been flying off the serving line. You might want to try it before it's all gone.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Maybe I'll grab a bowl before the rush starts. By the way, have you seen the reviews on social media lately? People are loving our barbecue.<p class=message>Yeah, I saw. It's great to see all the positive feedback. I think we're really starting to build a reputation for ourselves.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We've come a long way since we first opened. I remember when we were struggling just to get people in the door.<p class=message>Yeah, but we never gave up. We kept refining our recipes and improving our service. And now we're one of the busiest places in Austin.<p class="message sent">That's true. We've really built up a loyal following. And I have to say, your brisket is second to none.<p class=message>Thanks, B. That means a lot coming from you. But let's not get too complacent. We still have new challenges to overcome and more people to please.<p class="message sent">Right, there's always room for improvement. We'll keep pushing ourselves to be the best we can be.<p class=message>Agreed. Now, let's get ready for the lunch crowd. I have a feeling it's going to be a busy one today.<p class="message sent">You got it. Let's rock this joint!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e36b1434-ac07-4638-99c9-43b420ed5543.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
