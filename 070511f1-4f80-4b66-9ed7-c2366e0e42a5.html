Welcome to the show, my name is A and I'll be your street performer for today. Are you guys ready to see some amazing tricks?"<p class="message sent message-content">"Absolutely! We can't wait to see what you have in store for us."<p class="message received message-content">"Great! Let's start things off with a classic trick. Watch closely as I juggle these three balls in the air."<p class="message sent message-content">"Wow, that's really impressive. How long did it take you to learn to juggle like that?"<p class="message received message-content">"Thanks! I actually started practicing when I was about 12 years old, and I've been working on new tricks ever since."<p class="message sent message-content">"That's amazing dedication. What other kinds of tricks do you perform?"<p class="message received message-content">"Well, I also do some card tricks, balloon animals, and even some fire juggling if the venue allows for it. What would you guys like to see next?"<p class="message sent message-content">"I'd love to see a card trick if that's possible!"<p class="message received message-content">"Sure thing. Here's a deck of cards, go ahead and pick one out."<p class="message sent message-content">"Okay, I've picked one. What do I do now?"<p class="message received message-content">"Now, don't show me your card. Instead, I'm going to shuffle these cards and see if I can magically find your card. Ready?"<p class="message sent message-content">"Ready!"<p class="message received message-content">"Is this your card? The Ace of Hearts?"<p class="message sent message-content">"Yes! That's amazing, I have no idea how you did that."<p class="message received message-content">"Ha! It's all in the wrist. Thanks for being a great audience member and participating in the trick."<p class="message sent message-content">"No problem, that was really fun. Would you mind if I took a photo with you?"<p class="message received message-content">"Of course not, let's snap a quick selfie together."<p class="message sent message-content">"Awesome, thanks for the great performance!"<p class="message received message-content">"Thank YOU for being an awesome audience member. Hope to see you again soon!"</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=07047ee7-db6b-4f89-9cfd-160bd9510c1a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
