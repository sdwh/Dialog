Have you finished your code review?<p class="message sent">Hi A! Yeah, I just finished reviewing the code and found a couple of issues.<p class=message>Oh no, what did you find?<p class="message sent">There was a logical error in one of the functions, and I also noticed a couple of variables that were named incorrectly.<p class=message>Alright, those sound fixable. Did you create a ticket for those issues?<p class="message sent">Yes, I created tickets for each of them and assigned them to myself.<p class=message>Great! Now let's talk about how we can fix these issues. How do you plan on approaching the logical error?<p class="message sent">I think I'll start by drawing a flowchart of the function, and then I'll analyze where the issue occurs and how to fix it.<p class=message>Perfect, and for the incorrectly named variables?<p class="message sent">I'll just go through and rename them all. It shouldn't take too long.<p class=message>Alright, that sounds good. If you need any help, just let me know.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate that. By the way, have you tried that new coffee shop down the street yet?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's really good! They make a mean latte.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. We should go there for our next coffee break.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Maybe we can brainstorm some new ideas over coffee.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I'll bring my notebook.<p class="message sent">And I'll bring my laptop so we can work on the code together too.<p class=message>That sounds like a plan. Let's get those issues fixed and then head over to the coffee shop.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ab2259be-7d79-45e3-9591-7246a1330cfd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
