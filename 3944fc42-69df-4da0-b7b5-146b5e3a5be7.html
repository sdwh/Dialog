I'm glad you're here to give our animals a check-up.<p class="message sent">Hi there! It's always a pleasure to help out our furry friends. What animals do you have on this farm?<p class=message>We have cows, horses, sheep, and chickens. Let's start with the cows. They seem to be healthy but we want to make sure they stay that way.<p class="message sent">Great! Do you have any concerns about any of them in particular?<p class=message>Not really, but we did notice that one of them has been giving less milk than the others. We're not sure if that's normal or not.<p class="message sent">That's a valid concern. I'll have a closer look and check their weight, temperature, and overall condition. We can go from there.<p class=message>Thank you, that would be helpful. How about the horses?<p class="message sent">They look good, but a couple of them need their hooves trimmed. It's important for their overall health.<p class=message>I see. We'll take care of that right away. How about the sheep and chickens?<p class="message sent">The sheep look healthy, but I do notice that some of the chickens have a minor case of lice. We can easily take care of that with a special shampoo.<p class=message>That's good to know. We can't have any sick animals on the farm. Thank you for your help, Doctor.<p class="message sent">My pleasure! It's always important to keep our animals healthy and happy.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3944cdb5-76d6-470f-8572-d3ceeaab258e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
