Could you please pop the trunk? I have a few bags to put in.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! I'll just hit the button for you. Where to today?<p class=message>I'm headed to the airport. How's your day going?<p class="message sent">Not too bad, thanks for asking. How about yours?<p class=message>Pretty good so far, although I'm not looking forward to the flight.<p class="message sent">I hear you. I don't envy anyone who has to fly these days.<p class=message>Yeah, especially with all the crowds and delays.<p class="message sent">Speaking of crowds, have you heard about that new restaurant that just opened up?<p class=message>No, I can't say I have. What's it like?<p class="message sent">It's supposed to be amazing! I've been dying to try it out myself.<p class=message>Well, if it's as good as you say, I might have to give it a shot.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Hey, do you have any music preferences? I've got a pretty wide range of CDs if you want to listen to something on the way.<p class=message>Hmm, surprise me! I'm in a bit of a music rut lately.<p class="message sent">Got it. Let me know if anything strikes your fancy.<p class=message>Will do, thanks. So how long have you been driving a cab?<p class="message sent">Oh, quite a while now. About 10 years or so. It's not the most glamorous job, but it pays the bills.<p class=message>I hear ya. I'm only taking this trip because of a work obligation.<p class="message sent">Hey, work is work, right? At least you get to see some new places.<p class=message>That's true. Have you done much traveling yourself?<p class="message sent">Not as much as I'd like, honestly. But I did take a trip to Hawaii a couple years back.<p class=message>Nice! I've been meaning to go myself.<p class="message sent">Highly recommend it. The beaches are absolutely stunning.<p class=message>Well, maybe one day. For now, it's just another airport trip. But thanks for the company and the tunes!<p class="message sent">Anytime. Safe travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=966c5c83-7ed4-4dd6-bc60-8a6a2856c39f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
