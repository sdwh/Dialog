How's it going with the ISO 27001 audit plan?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty well, I think. We've got the risk assessment and the asset management pieces down. How about you?<p class=message>Same here, but have you figured out how to handle the access control aspect?<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's next on my to-do list. I was thinking we could use role-based access control strategies to ensure better security.<p class=message>Good idea, that will definitely help to keep sensitive information protected. But what if we come across any noncompliance issues during the audit?<p class="message sent">We'll have to make sure to document everything and work with the company to come up with a plan to address the issues. Communication is key in situations like this.<p class=message>Absolutely! And speaking of communication, have you tried the new Indian restaurant down the street yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had the chance. Is it any good?<p class=message>Yeah, I went there last night and it was amazing. The samosas were so delicious!<p class="message sent">Samosas, huh? Alright, we definitely need to hit up that restaurant soon. But let's finish this audit plan first.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7fb2e695-6d6c-47bb-858c-123e8ded76a1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
