I've heard you're a game developer. What kind of RPG are you working on right now?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am! We're currently developing a new RPG that's set in a medieval fantasy world. We're trying to make it as immersive as possible.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing! What kind of characters are you planning on having in the game?<p class="message sent">We want to have a variety of characters that players can choose from. We'll have knights, archers, mages, healers, and many more.<p class=message>Sounds like there'll be something for everyone. What kind of skills can players expect to learn?<p class="message sent">We'll have skill trees for each character class, with unique skills that players can unlock as they level up. For example, knights can learn powerful sword techniques, while mages can master elemental magic.<p class=message>That sounds like it'll make gameplay more interesting. What kind of quests can players look forward to?<p class="message sent">We're creating a mix of main quests and side quests that players can complete based on their preferences. Main quests will delve deeper into the game's story, while side quests will be more optional. Some may even have fun Easter eggs for players to discover.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. When can we expect to play this game?<p class="message sent">We're aiming to release it by the end of the year, but we still have some polishing to do. Our team is working hard to create the best possible game for our players.<p class=message>I can't wait to play it! Good luck to your team and thanks for sharing your insights with me.<p class="message sent">Thank you!
