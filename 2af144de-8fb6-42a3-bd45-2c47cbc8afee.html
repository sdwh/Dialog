Just swamped with work. How about you?<p class=message>Same here, but it's exciting work anyways. So, what's new?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have been going over your book manuscript and I must say, it looks promising.<p class=message>Thank you, I worked really hard on it.<p class="message sent">Yes, I can tell. Now, I want you to be prepared for some hard work that lies ahead if we want to see it succeed.<p class=message>Oh, I'm ready for it. Can I know what's on your mind?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, let's discuss the book cover. We have to come up with something captivating.<p class=message>Definitely! I have a few ideas I'd like to run by you.<p class="message sent">Great, that's what I like to hear - an author who's involved in the process too.<p class=message>My agent also suggested we should have a book launch before it's officially released in the market.<p class="message sent">That's a fabulous idea! It'll help promote the book better. Have you thought about a venue?<p class=message>I was thinking of having it at my favorite bookstore.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. They can help with the promotion too. Do you want to include any interactive activities with the readers?<p class=message>Maybe a Q&A or a short reading from the book?<p class="message sent">That's perfect. To begin with, let's put these ideas down and brainstorm some more.<p class=message>Sure, let's get to it. What do you say about us grabbing some coffee?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I could use a quick break.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2aeb2535-587f-452b-b522-f7a88625d21b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
