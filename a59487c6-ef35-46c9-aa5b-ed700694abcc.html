It's a great job.<p class=message>I can imagine. How do you like it?<p class="message sent">It's good, I get to meet new people every day and learn something new every time. So, where are you headed?<p class=message>I'm heading to Canberra for a business meeting. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. Canberra is a great place to visit.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Do you have any recommendations for places to visit?<p class="message sent">The War Memorial is definitely worth a visit. And if you're interested in politics, you can visit the Parliament and sit in on a session.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendations, I'll definitely check them out. So, what do you do in your free time?<p class="message sent">I like to go fishing when I'm not working. It's relaxing and I get to spend time with my family.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you have any favorite spots to fish?<p class="message sent">Yes, there's a quiet spot near the river that I like to go to. It's peaceful and always has good fish.<p class=message>It sounds like a perfect spot. Maybe I'll have to try it out sometime.<p class="message sent">You should definitely give it a try. Fishing is a great way to escape from the stresses of daily life.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the ride and the great conversation.<p class="message sent">You're welcome.
