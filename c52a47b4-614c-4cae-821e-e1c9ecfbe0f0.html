Can you help me out with that?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! We have a great selection of tripods and zoom lenses to choose from. What type of camera do you have?<p class=message>I have a Canon EOS Rebel T7.<p class="message sent">Great! We have a tripod that is perfect for that camera. It has adjustable legs and a sturdy base that can hold up to 6.6 pounds.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. And what about a zoom lens? I want to take some high-quality photos of my dog while we're out on hikes.<p class="message sent">Well, we have a Tamron zoom lens. It has a focal length of 70-300mm and is perfect for outdoor photography.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds perfect! How would I attach that to my camera?<p class="message sent">It's simple, just remove the existing lens on your camera and attach the zoom lens in its place. That's it!<p class=message>That sounds easy enough. How much would both the tripod and zoom lens cost?<p class="message sent">The tripod is $59.99 and the zoom lens is $199.99. But if you buy them together, we can offer a $25 discount.<p class=message>That sounds like a great deal. I'll take them both!<p class="message sent">Excellent! I can ring you up here at the counter. Don't forget to sign up for our rewards program, so you can earn points towards future purchases.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. I hope you enjoy using your new tripod and zoom lens. Have fun taking pictures of your furry friend!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c525eea2-27d8-42d7-9967-0861e2556399.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
