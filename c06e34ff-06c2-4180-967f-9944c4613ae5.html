Have you made any progress on the backend for our project?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing well thanks. Yes, I've been working on it and I'm almost finished. How's the frontend coming along?<p class=message>That's great news! I'm making some good progress on the frontend, but I'm still tweaking a few things. How about we join forces later and test the integration?<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Hey, have you heard about the new coffee machine in the break room? It's amazing!<p class=message>I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but I've heard it makes the best cappuccinos. I can't wait to take a break and try it out.<p class="message sent">Definitely, it's almost like having a barista in the office. By the way, have you seen the latest update on the design of the login page?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Did you make some changes to it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I updated the interface and added some new features. You should check it out later.<p class=message>I will definitely do that. Say, do you have any recommendations for a good restaurant for lunch around here?<p class="message sent">Yeah, there's a great sushi place just a few blocks away. We should go there sometime.<p class=message>That sounds perfect, I love sushi. Maybe we can go there for lunch tomorrow after testing our integration.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm in. I'll book a table now. So, have you seen the latest episode of that new show everyone's talking about?<p class=message>No, I haven't had time to catch up on my shows. I've been so busy with this project. Which show are you talking about?<p class="message sent">It's called "The Mandalorian", and it's a new Star Wars series. You should give it a try.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard great things about it. I'll definitely check it out when I have some free time. By the way, how's your cat doing?<p class="message sent">She's doing great, thanks for asking. She always keeps me entertained when I'm working from home.<p class=message>That's awesome, pets are the best companions. Well, I better get back to work now. See you later for integration testing and sushi!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Let's get this project done!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c06e1932-d976-4464-ac24-8556dc073cfc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
