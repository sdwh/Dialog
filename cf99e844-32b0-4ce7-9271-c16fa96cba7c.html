I learned how to make the famous Okinawan drink called Shikuwasa juice.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! Can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Sure, it's made from a citrus fruit called shikuwasa which is only found in Okinawa. The juice is mixed with honey and water, and it's so refreshing.<p class=message>Wow, I can't wait to try it! What about the food?<p class="message sent">I learned how to make Okinawa soba which is a type of noodle soup. The noodles are made from wheat flour and they're thicker than regular soba noodles.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. How is it different from regular soba?<p class="message sent">The soup is made with pork bone and the noodles have a unique texture. It's really delicious.<p class=message>I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Do you think we can add these dishes to our menu?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I think our customers will love them.<p class=message>Great, let's start planning our new menu then. How about we serve Shikuwasa juice as a welcome drink?<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. And we can introduce Okinawa soba as a lunch special.<p class=message>Amazing. I can't wait to see the reactions of our customers.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's exciting to introduce new dishes and drinks to our restaurant.<p class=message>I agree. It's all about giving our customers a new and unique experience.<p class="message sent">Exactly. That's what makes our restaurant stand out.<p class=message>Thanks for sharing your experience, B. Let's get started on our new menu right away!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cf94ac4d-f883-4216-a77a-685f820e8a50.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
