How's your day?<p class="message sent">Good morning, doctor A. It's been pretty busy, but I'm doing okay. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. So, who's our first patient today?<p class="message sent">It's Mr. Johnson. He's here for his annual check-up.<p class=message>Ah, Mr. Johnson. The man who always brings us doughnuts.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's the one. You think he'll bring some today?<p class=message>I hope so! So, did you get a chance to try that new coffee place down the street?<p class="message sent">Yes, finally! And it was amazing.<p class=message>Glad to hear that. I'll have to try it sometime. Now, let's go see Mr. Johnson.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Hey, do you remember that patient we had last week who kept insisting they had a rare disease?<p class=message>Oh, yes. Turns out it was just allergies.<p class="message sent">I know, right? It's always the simplest things that people make a fuss about.<p class=message>Well, that's why they come to us for expert advice.<p class="message sent">True. Oh, speaking of expert advice, did you know that Dr. Smith from the hospital is teaching a new CPR course next month?<p class=message>No, I hadn't heard. Thanks for letting me know. We should both sign up.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Alright, Mr. Johnson is waiting. Let's go show him some of our expert advice.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. And maybe, just maybe, there will be doughnuts involved.<p class="message sent">Fingers crossed!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=90388858-940d-4c5f-a018-d3341ff2a03a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
