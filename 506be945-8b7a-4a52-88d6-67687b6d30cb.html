I heard you're developing a new game for the Nintendo Switch, can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Hi A, yes, we're working on a game that's a mix of adventure and puzzle-solving, with a bit of platforming thrown in for good measure.<p class=message>That sounds awesome! What's the story behind the game?<p class="message sent">It's about a person who gets sucked into a parallel world and has to find their way back by exploring the strange landscapes, interacting with the inhabitants, and solving puzzles.<p class=message>That's really cool! Can you give me a sneak peek at some of the puzzles?<p class="message sent">Sure, we have puzzles that involve manipulating gravity, controlling time, and even some that require out-of-the-box thinking.<p class=message>Wow, sounds like this game is going to be a hit. Do you have any plans for multiplayer?<p class="message sent">Yes, we're planning on adding a co-op mode that allows two players to work together to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.<p class=message>Count me in! When do you plan to release the game?<p class="message sent">We're aiming for the middle of next year, but it depends on how development goes.<p class=message>I'll be sure to keep an eye out for it. So, what's your favorite part of developing video games?<p class="message sent">Definitely the creative aspect. Coming up with new ideas and seeing them come to life is such a satisfying feeling.<p class=message>I can only imagine. Do you have any favorite games that inspired you?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. The Legend of Zelda series has always been a huge inspiration, as well as games like Portal and Fez.<p class=message>Great choices, I love those games too. Well, it's been great talking to you about your new game, B. Best of luck with the development!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. It was a pleasure talking to you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=506a9d84-62b3-4f39-8187-75907578a0f8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
