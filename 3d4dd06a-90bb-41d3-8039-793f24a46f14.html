But what's bothering me most is the possibility of cheating.<p class=message>Oh, really? How can you be so sure about that?<p class="message sent">Well, you know, there's always some people who try to take shortcuts instead of studying hard.<p class=message>That's true. But don't worry, there are ways to prevent cheating. For example, we can have proctors carefully monitor the exam room.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. But what if someone manages to sneak in some notes or a cheat sheet?<p class=message>Hmmm, that's a tricky one. Maybe they can make everyone empty their pockets and leave their belongings outside the room.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that might work. Or how about randomly checking students during the exam to make sure they're not cheating?<p class=message>Yeah, that could work too. We wouldn't want those cheaters ruining it for everyone else who studied hard to earn their certification.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's important to maintain the integrity of the certification process. Plus, if you cheat, you're only cheating yourself in the end.<p class=message>Exactly. And besides, having a certification that you truly earned will give you a greater sense of accomplishment and confidence in your skills.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. It's always better to work hard and achieve something honestly, rather than taking shortcuts and risking getting caught.<p class=message>Very true. So, let's study hard and ace that certification exam â€“ no cheating required!<p class="message sent">You got it. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3d475639-061d-4e6c-80a5-2b89d435acfb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
