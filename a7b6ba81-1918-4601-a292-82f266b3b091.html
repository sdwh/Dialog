Could you recommend any titles?<p class=message>Of course, we have a great selection of young adult books. Have you considered the "Percy Jackson and the Olympians" series by Rick Riordan?<p class="message sent">My students love adventure books, so that sounds perfect! Do you have any other suggestions?<p class=message>Another popular series is "The Maze Runner" by James Dashner. It's also full of adventure and mystery.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Oh, have you heard of the graphic novel "Nimona" by Noelle Stevenson? I heard great things about it.<p class=message>Yes! It's a New York Times bestseller and with good reason. The illustrations and plot are exceptional.<p class="message sent">Excellent, I'll add that to my list. Oh, do you happen to have any books about space for my science class?<p class=message>Absolutely! You can't go wrong with books by Neil deGrasse Tyson or Bill Nye. We have many options in the astronomy section as well.<p class="message sent">That's wonderful. Thank you so much for your help, I really appreciate it.<p class=message>You're welcome. It's always great to see teachers promoting reading and learning for their students.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a7b4573c-2f14-4df2-9d62-3ca20e23f6ea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
