Are you enjoying this game of poker?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's been great so far. I just wish I had a better hand.<p class=message>Haha, tell me about it. My hand has been terrible too. But that's part of the fun, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! It's all about the thrill of the game. Who knows, maybe luck will be on our side soon.<p class=message>Exactly! In the meantime, we can still enjoy each other's company and chat a bit.<p class="message sent">Definitely. So, do you play poker a lot?<p class=message>I do, but mostly online. This is my first time playing in person in a long time. How about you?<p class="message sent">Same here! I actually prefer playing with real cards and face-to-face interaction.<p class=message>I know what you mean. There's something special about the social aspect of it.<p class="message sent">Speaking of socializing, have you heard any good jokes lately?<p class=message>Hmm, let me think. Oh, I have one! Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything.<p class="message sent">Hahaha, that's a good one. Here's one for you. Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts.<p class=message>Nice, I love a good pun. *checks cards* Oh, looks like I have to fold again.<p class="message sent">Hey, don't worry about it. The game isn't over yet. Keep smiling and let's hope for the best.<p class=message>You're right. It's not over until it's over. Thanks for the encouragement.<p class="message sent">No problem! And who knows, maybe the next round will be your lucky break.<p class=message>I certainly hope so. *shuffles cards* Let's keep playing and see what happens.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d2a93d6c-7cd2-4402-bd28-3dd9ddcad2d8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
