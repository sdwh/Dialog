How about you, A?<p class=message>I'm doing well too. So, what's the status on that project we were discussing yesterday?<p class="message sent">I did some research on it and I think I have some ideas that could work. Do you have a minute to go over them?<p class=message>Sure, let's hear it.<p class="message sent">Well, I was thinking maybe we could try approaching it from a different angle. Instead of focusing on the immediate issue, we could look at the root cause and try to address that.<p class=message>That's actually a pretty good idea. I like the way you think.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I'm just trying to learn as much as I can while I'm here.<p class=message>And you're doing a great job at it! I remember when I was an intern, I had no idea what I was doing.<p class="message sent">Haha, well I have you to thank for showing me the ropes.<p class=message>No problem. That's what mentors are for. But don't forget, you're more than just an intern to us. You're an important part of the team.<p class="message sent">Aww, that means a lot to me, A. Thanks.<p class=message>Anytime. And if you have any more ideas, don't hesitate to share them with me.<p class="message sent">Will do, A. I'm excited to see what we can accomplish together.<p class=message>Me too, B.
