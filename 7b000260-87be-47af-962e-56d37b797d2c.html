What do you think is going on?<p class=message>I think it's a communication problem. Ted always speaks his mind, but Sally doesn't seem to get his point of view.<p class="message sent">Well, maybe Ted needs to learn how to communicate better. Or, maybe Sally needs to be more open to different opinions.<p class=message>Yeah, that's true. But it's not just them. There seems to be a lot of tension between other co-workers too.<p class="message sent">Do you think we should do something about it?<p class=message>Maybe we could organize a team building exercise or a communication workshop. That way, everyone can learn to work better together.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! We could even make it fun, like a game or a challenge.<p class=message>Exactly! Something interactive and engaging. I'm sure everyone would be on board.<p class="message sent">And hey, it might even improve our office culture overall. Win-win!<p class=message>Absolutely. It's always better to work in an environment where everyone gets along and communicates effectively.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's set a time to talk to our boss and see if we can make this happen.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7af91db6-e094-4987-90ee-74e1be990e24.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
