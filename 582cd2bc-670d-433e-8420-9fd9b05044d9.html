I need to start making the noodles.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, boss. Hey, did you hear about that new ramen spot that just opened down the street?<p class=message>Yeah, I heard about it. But our noodles and soup broth are unbeatable. Plus, we make everything fresh right here!<p class="message sent">True that. Hey, have you ever considered adding a new type of noodle to the menu?<p class=message>Hmm, that's not a bad idea. Maybe something with a little spice? What do you think?<p class="message sent">I was actually thinking a black garlic infused noodle. It would give it a nice savory flavor.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! We could definitely try it out and see how it goes.<p class="message sent">I'm also thinking of experimenting with a vegan broth option for our vegetarian customers.<p class=message>Great idea! Let's get started on that as soon as possible. We want all of our customers to be happy and satisfied.<p class="message sent">You got it, boss. I'll start working on some new recipes and we can test them out together.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I can't wait to see what you come up with.<p class="message sent">Likewise, boss. We're always looking to improve and innovate here at our noodle shop!<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. Now, hand me that rolling pin, it's time to get to work on these noodles.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=582c533f-ad51-4c1e-a228-104f81120208.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
