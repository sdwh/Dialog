How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Not too shabby. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. Just finishing up the latest chapter of my novel.<p class="message sent">Great! Let's take a look. I'm eager to start editing.<p class=message>Absolutely. By the way, have I mentioned that the inspiration for the protagonist came from my pet cat?<p class="message sent">No, you haven't! That's interesting. What's your cat's name?<p class=message>His name is Tiberius, but in the book, I renamed him to Mr. Whiskers for laughs.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's hilarious! Mr. Whiskers sounds like quite the character.<p class=message>He definitely is. And speaking of characters, what do you think of the antagonist in the story?<p class="message sent">I think he's very well-developed. His motives make sense and his actions are believable.<p class=message>Thank you. I've been working hard to make sure no one comes across as one-dimensional.<p class="message sent">Well, it shows. Your dialogue is also witty and engaging.<p class=message>(smiling) Thank you. I like to think I have a way with words.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You definitely do. There's only a few minor spelling errors, but overall, it's top-notch work.<p class=message>Awesome! I couldn't have done it without you. I'm excited to see the final product.<p class="message sent">Same here. Keep up the great work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9d7ecf1c-895f-4460-8a15-24f884bcaa3f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
