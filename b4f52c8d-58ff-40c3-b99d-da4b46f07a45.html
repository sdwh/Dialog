I thought it would be fun to bake some cookies. Do you want to help me?<p class=message>Of course! Chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin?<p class="message sent">How about we make both? I love chocolate, but I know you prefer oatmeal.<p class=message>That’s a great idea. Let’s get started. Do we have all the ingredients we need?<p class="message sent">We should have everything in the pantry. I’ll grab the flour and sugar, you get the baking sheets and measuring cups.<p class=message>Alright, sounds like a plan. So, how was school today?<p class="message sent">It was good. We just finished our finals. I’m ready for summer break!<p class=message>That’s great to hear. Any plans for the summer?<p class="message sent">I’m hoping to get a part-time job and also hang out with my friends. What about you, mom?<p class=message>Work, work, and more work. Maybe if I’m lucky, I’ll have some time for a weekend getaway.<p class="message sent">That sounds nice. So, have you been keeping up with your yoga classes?<p class=message>Yes, I’ve been trying to make it to at least one class a week. It really helps me relax and destress.<p class="message sent">I’m sure it does. I should start doing some yoga too.<p class=message>Absolutely! It’s never too early to start taking care of your body and mind.<p class="message sent">You’re right. Okay, let’s start mixing the ingredients now. Can you help me measure out the flour?<p class=message>Sure thing. This reminds me of when you were little and used to help me bake.<p class="message sent">Yeah, those were fun times. I’m glad we’re still baking together.<p class=message>Me too, sweetie. Now, let’s get these cookies in the oven and enjoy our freshly baked treats together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b4f33c63-e1ab-4a41-932c-cb1ac3e6cf9f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
