Another busy night ahead of us, right?<p class="message sent">That's right, A. I hope we are ready to impress our guests tonight.<p class=message>Of course! We have some fresh sashimi and wagyu beef. What would go well with those?<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe a nice bottle of chilled sake? That would definitely complement the flavors.<p class=message>Good idea! And how about for the non-alcoholic drinkers?<p class="message sent">We could offer them a mocktail with some fresh fruit juice and a splash of soda. What do you think?<p class=message>Sounds refreshing! And speaking of fruit, have you tried the new yuzu liqueur that our boss got in for the bar?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's amazing! Very citrusy and with a perfect balance of sweetness and sourness.<p class=message>I can imagine it going well with a light seafood dish. Maybe we can suggest that to our guests.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And speaking of seafood, have you heard about the new hot trend of vegan sushi rolls?<p class=message>Really? How do they make them without using fish?<p class="message sent">They use a variety of creative ingredients like tofu, avocado, and even fruit. It's quite interesting.<p class=message>Wow, that does sound interesting. I am sure some of our guests would love to try that.<p class="message sent">Yes, we should definitely let them know about this new option. I can't wait to see their reactions!<p class=message>Me too! Let's make sure that our kitchen and bar are ready to provide the best dining experience for them.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Let's do this, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bbc31bd8-b903-4a7a-8bdd-f6d4d4538931.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
