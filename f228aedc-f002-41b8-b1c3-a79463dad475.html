Please have a seat. How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Thank you for meeting with me. I have some questions about my financial report.<p class=message>Sure thing, B. Let me pull up your report on my computer. What specific concerns do you have?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm not sure what some of these numbers mean, and I'm a bit confused about the overall profit and loss.<p class=message>I see. Let's start by going over your revenue and expenses. Can you follow along on this spreadsheet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have it open on my computer as well.<p class=message>Great. Now, for revenue, we have your total sales and any other income you've earned. And for expenses, we have your cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and any other expenses. Do you see where these numbers come from?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. But what about the profit and loss?<p class=message>That's simply the difference between revenue and expenses. If revenue is greater than expenses, then you have a profit. If expenses are greater than revenue, then you have a loss.<p class="message sent">Ah, I think I understand now. Thank you, A. You've been very helpful.<p class=message>Of course, that's what I'm here for. Do you have any other questions?<p class="message sent">No, I think that's it for now. Thanks again.<p class=message>My pleasure, B. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f219e88b-dc49-4351-8de1-64f637a0613d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
