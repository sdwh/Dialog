I heard you're preparing for the TOEIC exam. How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey! Yeah, I've been studying really hard. But I'm always looking for new tips and tricks. How about you?<p class=message>Same here! Actually, I found a really helpful blog with some great test-taking strategies.<p class="message sent">Oh, really? Can you send me the link?<p class=message>Sure thing! I'll email it to you after we finish chatting.<p class="message sent">Awesome, thanks! Have you tried any other study methods?<p class=message>Yeah, I've been doing a lot of practice tests and focusing on my weaknesses.<p class="message sent">Good idea! For me, I've been watching a lot of English TV shows to improve my listening skills.<p class=message>I've heard that's really helpful. Do you have any favorites?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I love Friends and The Office. They're both hilarious and easy to understand.<p class=message>Oh, I love Friends too! Have you tried using flashcards to memorize vocabulary?<p class="message sent">Actually, no. Do you find them helpful?<p class=message>Definitely! I make them with pictures and examples sentences to help me remember the words.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I'll have to try that out.<p class=message>Another tip I read was to read news articles in English to improve reading comprehension. Have you tried that?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but it sounds like a good idea. Do you have any websites you recommend?<p class=message>Yeah, I like to read articles on BBC News and The New York Times.<p class="message sent">Cool, I'll check those out. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class=message>No problem! We should also try practicing speaking together sometime to improve our fluency.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Maybe we can have a conversation in English next time we meet up.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! We'll be TOEIC experts in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cd8b28eb-0dcf-467c-a614-749fa2e6921c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
