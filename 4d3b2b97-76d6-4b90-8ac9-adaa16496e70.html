It's all about information security management, right?<p class=message>Yes, that's right. It's all about ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a serious and important matter.<p class=message>Definitely, but it doesn't have to be boring. I mean, who doesn't like to keep their information safe, right?<p class="message sent">Haha, true. So, do you know anyone who is ISO 27001 compliant?<p class=message>Well, I know a few companies that have achieved it. They say it gives them a competitive edge.<p class="message sent">Really? How so?<p class=message>Think about it, would you rather trust your sensitive information with someone who has implemented security measures or someone who hasn't?<p class="message sent">Good point. So, what do you think is the most challenging aspect of ISO 27001 compliance?<p class=message>I would say it's the continuous improvement. The standards require regular reviews and updates to ensure the effectiveness of the measures.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. But hey, at least it keeps us on our toes, right?<p class=message>Absolutely! It's always better to have proactive measures than to wait for something bad to happen.<p class="message sent">Couldn't agree more. Thanks for the enlightening conversation, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B.
