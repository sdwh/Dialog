It's so delicious!<p class="message sent">Yes, I just had it. It's creamy, and the burnt sugar on top is the perfect touch.<p class=message>Exactly! I love the contrast between the crunchy sugar and the silky smooth custard underneath.<p class="message sent">Me too! And it's not too sweet, so you can enjoy the flavor of the vanilla and the cream.<p class=message>That's true. It's such a classic dessert, but it never gets old.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's one of my favorite French desserts. Have you ever tried making it at home?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Have you?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's actually not that difficult, as long as you have a torch to caramelize the sugar on top.<p class=message>Oh, that's good to know. I might try making it myself sometime.<p class="message sent">You should! It's always satisfying to make something from scratch and enjoy it with friends and family.<p class=message>That's true. And I bet it would be even more rewarding to make a dessert as delicious as this one.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And if you need any tips or recipes, just let me know. I'd be happy to help.<p class=message>Thank you so much! I'll keep that in mind. Let's order some more Crème brûlée in the meantime.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a9c4729a-6e7b-407c-b02e-011b45dd0d84.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
