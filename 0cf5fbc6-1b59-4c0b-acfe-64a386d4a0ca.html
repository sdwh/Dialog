Have you had a chance to look at the findings from the source code scan?<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm doing well, thanks for asking. Yeah, I went through the report and it looks like we have quite a few vulnerabilities to address.<p class=message>Yeah, there are definitely some areas we need to work on. Did you see the one about the SQL injection vulnerability in the login page?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I'm working on fixing that right now, actually. I figured it would be a good place to start.<p class=message>Awesome. It's always good to tackle the high-risk vulnerabilities first. Have you come across any challenges in fixing it?<p class="message sent">Just a few minor ones, but nothing too major. I'm rewriting the query to use prepared statements, which should take care of the issue.<p class=message>That's great, prepared statements are definitely the way to go. Anything else stand out to you in the report?<p class="message sent">Actually, there was one finding that I found kind of amusing. The report flagged a comment in one of the files that said "TODO: fix this hacky code later."<p class=message>Ha! Yeah, I saw that too. I guess we know what we'll be working on next.<p class="message sent">Definitely. That comment might have been humorous, but it's important to take care of those "hacky" pieces of code as soon as possible.<p class=message>Agreed. It's always better to address those issues sooner rather than later, especially if they're security-related.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Hey, speaking of security, have you seen that new gadget that's supposed to protect you from hackers by blocking their signals?<p class=message>Oh, you mean the RF-blocking wallet? Yeah, I've heard of it. Seems like a bit of a gimmick to me, but who knows?<p class="message sent">Ha, yeah, maybe. But hey, anything that can help keep our data safe is worth considering, right?<p class=message>For sure. It's always good to stay on top of new developments in the security landscape.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Alright, I'm going to get back to fixing that SQL injection vulnerability. Thanks for the chat, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Let me know if you need any help with anything. Keep up the good work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0cf459d9-9e7f-40d4-ab2b-f8aa04b24343.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
