It was fantastic! The creamy texture and the cheesy flavor make it a definite winner.<p class=message>That's great to hear. We worked hard to get the right balance of flavors and textures.<p class="message sent">I noticed that the nutritional value is quite good too. It's not often you get a comfort food that's healthy.<p class=message>Yeah, we wanted to make sure we're meeting the market's demand for healthier food options.<p class="message sent">Speaking of markets, have you considered the vegan market? It's a growing trend and we can make a vegan version of this mac and cheese.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can use nutritional yeast instead of cheese and almond milk instead of regular milk. I'm excited to work on that.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Speaking of work, have you seen the latest batch of potato chips we received for testing?<p class=message>Yes, I have. Unfortunately, they didn't meet our standards. They're overcooked and taste burnt.<p class="message sent">That's too bad. I'll note it down on the report and we'll get in touch with the supplier to discuss.<p class=message>Speaking of suppliers, have you given any thought to the international market? We can expand our range and reach new customers.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We can start with the neighboring countries and see where it goes from there. We have some great flavors that would work well in different cultures.<p class=message>I'm excited to see where this goes. It's great that we get to innovate and explore new possibilities together.<p class="message sent">Agreed. It's what makes our job interesting and challenging. But it also tastes great!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2ed4a8a6-17d2-40fa-9f3f-4771d0f428aa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
