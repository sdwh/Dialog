You ready to play some Arcade games?<p class="message sent">Hey A, yeah, let's do it! What games do you have in mind?<p class=message>How about we start with some classic Pac-Man? It's always a classic.<p class="message sent">Yeah, sure, I'm down for that. I used to play that all the time as a kid.<p class=message>Awesome. I'll start us off and you can take over when I lose.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Hey, did you know that Pac-Man was originally called "Puck-Man" in Japan?<p class=message>Really? I had no idea. Why did they change it for the American version?<p class="message sent">Apparently, there were concerns that people would change the "P" to an "F" and create a profanity. So they changed it to Pac-Man.<p class=message>(Laughs) That's hilarious. Alright, your turn to play now.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's see if I still have my skills from childhood. (Starts playing)<p class=message>Nice moves, B. You're doing great.<p class="message sent">(Chuckles) Thanks, A. This is pretty fun. I could play this for hours.<p class=message>Same here. But we should probably mix it up and try some other games too.<p class="message sent">Good idea. Have you played Galaga? It's another classic.<p class=message>Yeah, I love that one too. Let's give it a shot.<p class="message sent">Alright, you start this time.<p class=message>(Starts playing) Woah, this is getting intense.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it definitely gets harder as you go. But you're doing great.<p class=message>(Laughs) Thanks. Okay, your turn to take over.<p class="message sent">Let's do this! (Starts playing)<p class=message>Nice job, B. I think we make a good team.<p class="message sent">(Smiles) Yeah, we definitely do. Thanks for suggesting this, A. It's been a blast.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Let's plan to do this again soon. Maybe we can try some newer games next time.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Can't wait!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f0c52847-5db9-427e-9b5e-67b71c769112.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
