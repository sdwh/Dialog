Learning how to make local Hakata dishes has been a dream come true!<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear. What's the trickiest dish you've learned so far?<p class="message sent">Definitely the mentaiko spaghetti. Getting the seasoning just right is a challenge.<p class=message>I hear you. It's a delicate balance between spicy and salty. But when it's done right, it's amazing.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Speaking of amazing, have you tried the grilled mackerel yet?<p class=message>Yes! It's one of my favorites. So crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.<p class="message sent">I'm so glad you like it. I was worried about the skin sticking to the grill at first.<p class=message>Well, you nailed it. Hey, have you had a chance to explore the city yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I went to Ramen Stadium and tried a tonkotsu ramen yesterday. It was incredible.<p class=message>Oh, I love that place. Did you go to the yatai stalls at night too?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. The atmosphere was vibrant and the food was excellent.<p class=message>That's great to hear. And at the end of the day, nothing beats kicking back with some sake and good company.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Thanks for being a great host and showing me the ropes, A.<p class=message>Anytime, B. I'm just happy to share my love for Hakata cuisine with others.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f56d29de-7bb2-4f88-9063-62bbfdbe7f78.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
