It's one of my favorites!<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. I didn't really like it though.<p class=message>What? How could you not like it? The tartness of the lime mixed with the sweetness of the crust is the perfect combination in my opinion.<p class="message sent">I don't know, I just didn't find it appealing.<p class=message>Well, maybe you just haven't had a good one yet. Where did you try it?<p class="message sent">It was at some random diner near my house.<p class=message>Ah, that could be the problem. You need to try one from a real bakery.<p class="message sent">Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Yeah, there's this place downtown that makes the best Key lime pie I've ever had. We should go there sometime.<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm always up for trying new food places.<p class=message>Awesome! So, have you ever made Key lime pie yourself?<p class="message sent">No, I actually haven't. Have you?<p class=message>Yeah, I've made it a few times. It's surprisingly easy to make, but you need to make sure you have fresh limes to get that perfect tartness.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. Maybe I'll give it a try sometime.<p class=message>You should! It's always fun to bake something new.<p class="message sent">Speaking of baking, have you ever had Key lime pie flavored cupcakes?<p class=message>No, but that sounds amazing! Where did you try those?<p class="message sent">The same diner that I had the pie at. I have to say, those were much better than the pie.<p class=message>Well, now I'm intrigued. Maybe we should stop by that diner after we try the bakery's pie to compare.<p class="message sent">You read my mind. Let's make it a Key lime pie taste test!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99aa0901-83d1-4a92-9156-cbcc3c23f726.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
