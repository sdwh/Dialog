Are you excited for your trip to Australia Perth?<p class=message>Definitely, I've always wanted to visit Australia. Any tips for me?<p class="message sent">Well, it's important to bring sunscreen and a hat, especially during the summer. Also, make sure to try some meat pies and a flat white coffee.<p class=message>Noted, thank you. Do you have any funny stories about your experiences as a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Actually, I once had a passenger who got into the car and started speaking in a different language to their phone. I assumed they were speaking to their friend, but it turned out they were using a translation app to speak to me.<p class=message>That's hilarious! I hope I don't have to use a translation app during my trip. Have you ever visited Perth before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have family there, so I visit quite often. It's a beautiful city with stunning beaches and great food.<p class=message>Sounds amazing. I can't wait to explore the beaches. Do you surf?<p class="message sent">(laughs) No, I'm not much of a water person. But I do enjoy fishing and barbecues on the beach.<p class=message>That does sound nice. Well, we're almost at the airport. Thank you for the ride and for the great conversation.<p class="message sent">No problem at all, have a safe flight and enjoy your trip to Australia Perth!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4fb1ac2d-e956-4540-8619-da21c832e7cf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
