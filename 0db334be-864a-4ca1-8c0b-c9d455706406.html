It's going to be an incredible concert.<p class="message received message-content">Well, speaking of incredible things, have you seen the results from the latest study on the health benefits of dark chocolate?<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, I have! It's amazing how something so tasty can also be good for you.<p class="message received message-content">Exactly! I think we need to do some more research on that, don't you?<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely. I think I'll start with a taste test, just to be sure.<p class="message received message-content">(laughs) Sounds like a plan! Let me know how it goes, B.<p class="message sent message-content">Will do, Professor A.
