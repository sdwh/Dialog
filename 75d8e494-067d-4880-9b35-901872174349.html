How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing well, thank you. It's a busy night at the restaurant tonight.<p class=message>Yes, it is. Our customers are particularly excited about our new selection of grilled meats and seafood. Have you tried any of them yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. The spicy Korean beef and the miso-marinated scallops are especially popular.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm glad our customers are enjoying your creations. Have you come up with any new recipes lately?<p class="message sent">As a matter of fact, I have. I've been experimenting with a honey-soy marinade and I think I've finally got it just right.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds delicious. I can't wait to try it. How do you usually prepare your meats for grilling?<p class="message sent">I like to season them with a blend of spices and herbs, let them marinate for a few hours, and then grill them over high heat for just a few minutes.<p class=message>Sounds like you know what you're doing. Do you have any advice for home cooks who want to grill their own meats?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. One key tip is to let the meat come to room temperature before grilling, so that it cooks more evenly. And always remember to rest the meat after cooking, to allow the juices to redistribute.<p class=message>That's great advice. Thanks, Chef B. Keep up the fantastic work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=75d1e09f-af03-4a27-97d5-a442f1048134.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
