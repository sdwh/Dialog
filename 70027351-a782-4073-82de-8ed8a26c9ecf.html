It's better to be prepared than to be caught off-guard.<p class="message sent">So, how do you think we can implement this plan in our company?<p class=message>We can start by conducting a risk assessment and involving key stakeholders in the process.<p class="message sent">Good idea. And we should also make sure everyone is trained on what to do in case of a disaster.<p class=message>Definitely. The key is to have a plan in place and practice it regularly.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And if something were to happen, we'll be ready to respond and minimize any potential damage.<p class=message>That's right. It's always better to be safe than sorry.<p class="message sent">Thanks for enlightening me on this, A. Let's get started on implementing this plan!<p class=message>No problem, B.
