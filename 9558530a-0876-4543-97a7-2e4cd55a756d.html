I'm the resident roaster here. Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi! Nice to meet you too. I can smell the fragrant coffee already. How do you roast your beans?<p class=message>I use a drum roaster. It's the best method for achieving an even roast on the beans. How about you?<p class="message sent">We use a hot-air roaster. It's efficient and consistent. Do you have a favorite coffee origin to roast?<p class=message>Definitely the Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. It has a unique fruity and floral flavor that I love. How do you like your coffee brewed?<p class="message sent">I prefer a classic drip coffee. What about you?<p class=message>I like it brewed as an espresso, with a medium to dark roast. It brings out the boldness and complexity of the beans. Do you have any interesting coffee facts to share?<p class="message sent">Yes, did you know that coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world after crude oil? And coffee can actually help reduce the risk of certain diseases.<p class=message>Really? That's amazing! I'll have to drink even more coffee now. Speaking of which, we should try brewing a cup together using your roasted beans and my brewing method.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Let's do it. I'm curious to see how our styles and flavors will blend together.<p class=message>Perfect. It's always fun to experiment and see what we can come up with. Cheers to the love of coffee!<p class="message sent">Cheers indeed! It's great to meet someone who shares the same passion for coffee. I think we'll make a great team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9553be27-4e7b-4403-bd77-d987753dafb6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
