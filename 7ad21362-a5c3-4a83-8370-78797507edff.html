How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hi, Officer A. Frankly, I've been better. But I'll survive.<p class=message>I understand that you've been brought in for questioning regarding a robbery that took place last night. Can you tell me where you were at the time of the incident?<p class="message sent">I was at home, catching up on some sleep. But if you want me to confess, I can say that I was out robbing banks all night long.<p class=message>(laughs) That's not the answer I was looking for, Mr. B. We take robbery charges very seriously.<p class="message sent">I know, I know. I'm innocent, Officer. But if you want me to help you catch the real culprit, just let me know. I'm always happy to assist the police.<p class=message>(smirks) I'll keep that in mind, Mr. B. But first, could you describe what you were wearing last night?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Are you asking me out on a date, Officer? I was wearing my pajamas, if you must know.<p class=message>(laughs) You're quite the comedian, Mr. B. But we need to get serious now. We have evidence that puts you at the scene of the robbery.<p class="message sent">What kind of evidence? Was it a clown nose on the security camera?<p class=message>(laughs) No, it was your DNA that was found on the door handle of the getaway car.<p class="message sent">(sarcastically) Oh, great detective work. Like I wasn't borrowing my neighbor's car to go buy groceries.<p class=message>(smiles) All right, Mr. B. You win this round. But don't get too comfortable yet. We'll be watching you.<p class="message sent">(smiles) Looking forward to it, Officer. You have a nice day now.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7ad1b070-2bef-428b-aa2a-57e3c7ea4a38.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
