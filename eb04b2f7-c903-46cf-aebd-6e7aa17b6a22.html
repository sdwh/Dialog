How was your day at school?<p class="message sent">It was good, Mom. We had a lot of fun learning about space today.<p class=message>That's wonderful. Have you finished all your homework?<p class="message sent">Yep, I just finished my math homework.<p class=message>Great work! Now, it's time to start your English homework. Are you ready?<p class="message sent">Yes, Mom. Let's do it!<p class=message>Okay, let's start with the first question. How would you describe your best friend?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. She's funny, kind, and always there for me when I need her.<p class=message>Sounds like a great friend. Now, let's move on to the next question. If you could be any animal, which one would you choose and why?<p class="message sent">I think I would want to be a dolphin because they are very smart and they get to swim in the ocean all day.<p class=message>That's a great choice! Dolphins are amazing creatures. Okay, one last question. If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go?<p class="message sent">I would love to go to Japan because I want to see the cherry blossoms and try all the delicious food there.<p class=message>Japan sounds like an amazing place to visit. We should plan a trip there someday.<p class="message sent">Yes, that would be so cool!<p class=message>Alright, we're all finished with your English homework now. Did you have fun?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did! English is my favorite subject.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's go make some hot cocoa and relax for a bit.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eb00e451-38ba-4462-9951-06ffa563a343.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
