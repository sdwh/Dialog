I can't help but notice the abundance of seafood in this area. Do you know where I can find the freshest catches?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm the chef at the restaurant just over there, and we always source our seafood directly from the local fisherman.<p class=message>That sounds perfect! As a diver, I'm always on the lookout for fresh and delicious seafood to cook up. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Well, you can't go wrong with the classic fish and chips. Our cod is particularly flavorful today.<p class=message>That sounds really good. But do you have any other suggestions for something a little more unique?<p class="message sent">How about trying the lobster roll? Our lobster is caught fresh this morning and paired with homemade mayonnaise - it's delicious.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing! How do you keep your seafood fresh?<p class="message sent">It's all about the ice. We pack our seafood in ice as soon as it's caught to ensure it stays fresh until it reaches your plate.<p class=message>That's good to know. And what about sustainability? Is that something you prioritize?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We only source our seafood from sustainable fisheries in order to ensure the health of our oceans and the longevity of our industry.<p class=message>That's great to hear. As a diver, sustainability is really important to me too. Do you have any recommendations for sustainable seafood choices?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Our tuna is caught using pole and line fishing - a more sustainable method that doesn't harm other marine life. It's also a really delicious and healthy choice.<p class=message>That's perfect. I'm definitely going to try that. Thanks for all your help!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Enjoy your meal, and feel free to come back anytime for some more fresh and delicious seafood.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a5b14f2a-b870-4aad-bec1-c07e86ee594b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
