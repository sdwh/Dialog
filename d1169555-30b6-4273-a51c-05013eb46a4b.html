If we have complex data management requirements then it could be worth the investment.<p class=message>Hmm, that's true. Do you know what the licensing fees look like?<p class="message sent">It varies depending on the version we choose and the number of users, but I can send you some estimates.<p class=message>Thanks, that would be helpful. I just hope it doesn't break the bank.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, we can work out a budget and see what options fit within it.<p class=message>That's a relief. I'm still learning about database management, but I know it's important to have the right tools in place.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Having the right database can make all the difference in terms of efficiency and accuracy.<p class=message>Yeah, and it's also important to have someone like you who understands the technical details.<p class="message sent">Ha, I do my best. It's a constantly evolving field, so we all have to keep learning.<p class=message>Definitely. Well, thanks for your help and I'll be sure to check out the estimates.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to assist!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d11576a5-8168-4f30-bb9b-809b86425a7d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
