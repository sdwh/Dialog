Have you finished going through the report on the recent penetration test we conducted?<p class="message sent">Hey A, not too bad, thanks. Yes, I have gone through the entire report, and there were certainly some interesting findings.<p class=message>Yeah, I thought so too. It's always fascinating to see how a system holds up against a simulated attack.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. One of the issues we discovered was a lack of proper password complexity requirements on some accounts.<p class=message>Ah, yes. I remember that. It's amazing how frequently that issue comes up in our tests.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Thankfully, it's an easy fix though. We've already implemented new password policies.<p class=message>Great! What else did we find?<p class="message sent">We also discovered some SQL injection vulnerabilities within the database. But we have already put measures in place to prevent this from happening again.<p class=message>That's really good to hear. Security is always a top priority in any organization.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And it's a continuous process. We have to stay vigilant and keep up with the latest threats.<p class=message>One thing I found interesting was how creative some of the attack methods were. It shows how persistent hackers can be.<p class="message sent">Yes, they definitely keep us on our toes. But we'll keep learning and increasing our knowledge to stay one step ahead.<p class=message>Well, it looks like we've done a good job patching up the vulnerabilities we found. Thanks for your help, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It was a team effort, and I'm glad we were able to work together to make our systems more secure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=16a1b9b9-b17d-4ff8-96d5-7c8c6970b91f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
