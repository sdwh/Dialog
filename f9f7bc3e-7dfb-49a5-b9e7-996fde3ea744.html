No, not yet. What is that?<p class=message>It's a Polish dish that's typically filled with mashed potatoes, cheese, and sometimes even meat.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! Do you know where I can try them?<p class=message>There's a restaurant down the road that serves them. I'll take you there sometime!<p class="message sent">That would be awesome. Are they hard to make at home?<p class=message>Not at all! You just need some Pierogi dough, kielbasa, and your chosen filling. It's actually a fun recipe to make with friends or family.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a fun activity. What's your favorite Pierogi filling?<p class=message>Hmm, that's a tough one. I'm torn between cheese and potato or sauerkraut and mushroom. How about you?<p class="message sent">I haven't tried them yet, but I think I'll go for the traditional cheese and potato.<p class=message>Great choice! Just be careful not to burn your tongue on the hot potato filling!<p class="message sent">Haha, will do. Have you ever tried dipping them in any sauce?<p class=message>Yes! I personally love them with sour cream or maybe some garlic butter. But it's really up to your preference.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds delicious. Can't wait to try them out with you!<p class=message>Definitely! I'll make sure to bring some Pierogi next time we hang out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f9f40afe-7558-4b1b-b2e1-61b4166828e2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
