How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, Doctor! How about you?<p class=message>I'm a bit tired, but I'm ready to see our patients today.<p class="message sent">Speaking of patients, we have Mrs. Cooper booked in for her regular check-up.<p class=message>Ah yes, Mrs. Cooper. She's always insisting that she's perfectly healthy.<p class="message sent">I know, but we have to give her credit for taking care of herself.<p class=message>Absolutely. I just hope she doesn't try to convince us that she climbed a mountain over the weekend again.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well, we'll just have to remind her that honesty is the best policy.<p class=message>On a serious note, have you prepared the reports for Mr. Carter's blood work?<p class="message sent">Yes, Doctor. I have them all organized and ready for you to review.<p class=message>Excellent. Mr. Carter is always so interested in his health, it's great to have a patient who takes such an active role in their own care.<p class="message sent">Yes it is. Speaking of active, have you gone for your morning run yet, Doctor?<p class=message>(smiles) No, I haven't had the chance today. Maybe I'll have to skip the run and join you for your yoga class after work.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You're always welcome to join me, Doctor. But let's make sure we take care of our patients first.<p class=message>Agreed. Well, let's get started then. I'm excited to see what we can do for our patients today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b1ae23bb-c01b-4234-8d87-eea373d84faf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
