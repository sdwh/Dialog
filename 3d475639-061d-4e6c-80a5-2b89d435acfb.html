How have you been doing with the course so far?<p class="message sent">I've been doing pretty well, thanks for asking. I feel like I'm getting a good handle on the material.<p class=message>That's great to hear. We've made it about halfway through the course now, and I wanted to check in and see how you're feeling about the pace.<p class="message sent">Honestly, I think it's been just about right. It's been challenging enough to keep me engaged, but not so hard that I'm overwhelmed.<p class=message>Excellent. We'll keep moving forward at this pace then. Is there anything in particular that you've found especially interesting or useful so far?<p class="message sent">I really enjoyed the section on idioms. I've been trying to use them more in my own writing and speech, and it feels like it's helping me sound more natural.<p class=message>Perfect, I'm glad to hear that. We'll definitely be doing more with idioms as we go along. And have you been keeping up with the homework assignments?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They've been challenging, but doable. It's been helpful to have the extra practice.<p class=message>Wonderful. Keep up the good work. And if at any point you start to feel like you're falling behind, please let me know so we can make any necessary adjustments.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I will. But for right now, I feel like everything's going well.<p class=message>Great. Then let's keep that momentum going. Do you have any questions for me about the upcoming material?<p class="message sent">Not at the moment, but I'll be sure to ask if I think of anything.<p class=message>Perfect. And one last thing: make sure you keep reviewing the material we've already covered. It's easy to forget things if you don't refresh your memory from time to time.<p class="message sent">Okay, I will. Thanks for the reminder.<p class=message>No problem. Have a great day, B!<p class="message sent">You too! Thanks for all your help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3d431e0d-f021-4018-93db-cf028e3d77b0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
