Have you had any incidents recently?<p class="message sent">Luckily, no. Knock on wood!<p class=message>Haha, I'm with you on that. What about risk management? How do you tackle potential risks?<p class="message sent">We conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and we have a team dedicated to mitigating them.<p class=message>That's impressive. It seems like your department is doing a great job in protecting the company's assets.<p class="message sent">It's important to us, that's for sure.
