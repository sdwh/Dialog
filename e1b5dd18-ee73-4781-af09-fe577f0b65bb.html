Have you completed the application form?<p class=message>Yes, I have. But I have a silly question. How long does it usually take to process a visa application?<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It usually takes around two to four weeks, but during the peak season, it might take a bit longer.<p class=message>Oh, that's good to know. I was worried I might not make it to my trip in time.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, we'll do our best to process it as quickly as possible. Do you already have a planned itinerary?<p class=message>Yes, I do. I'm excited to visit the Great Barrier Reef and do some snorkeling.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! Have you prepared your snorkeling gear already?<p class=message>Not yet, but I heard that there are a lot of shops in Australia that rent out snorkeling gear. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, I would recommend checking out the shops near the beaches you're planning to visit. They usually have better deals and more options.<p class=message>Thank you for the tip! I'm sure it will save me some money. By the way, do you have any favorite Australian food that I should try?<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely try the meat pies and lamingtons. They're delicious!<p class=message>Sounds yummy! I can't wait to try them. Thank you for your help with my visa application, and for the tips. You've been a great help.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, and I hope you have a fantastic trip to Australia!
