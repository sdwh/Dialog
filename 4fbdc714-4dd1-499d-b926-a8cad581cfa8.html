Need any help with it?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm stuck on this math problem. Can you help me?<p class=message>Sure thing. Let me take a look. Hmm, this looks like a tricky one.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I just can't seem to figure it out.<p class=message>Okay, so let's break it down step by step. First, we need to...<p class="message sent">Wow, dad! You explain it so much better than my teacher!<p class=message>(laughs) Well, I actually used to be pretty good at math back in my school days.<p class="message sent">Really? I can hardly imagine you as a student.<p class=message>Hey now, I was a model student! (winks)<p class="message sent">(laughs) If you say so, dad. Thanks for your help.<p class=message>Anytime, son. By the way, how's your geography project coming along?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty well. I think I'll be able to finish it by the end of the week.<p class=message>Good job. Remember to ask me or mom if you need any help with that as well.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks, dad.<p class=message>No problem. You know, when I was your age, I used to dread doing homework.<p class="message sent">Why's that, dad?<p class=message>Because I always wanted to go outside and play with my friends instead. But I learned that getting my work done first meant I had more free time later.<p class="message sent">That's a good tip. I'll keep that in mind next time.<p class=message>(smiles) See, you're already smarter than I was at your age.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Thanks, dad. You're the best.<p class=message>And you're the best son a parent could ask for. Now let's keep working on that math problem!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4fb716ae-87db-4e10-bae4-0b72f73a2c68.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
