How about you?<p class=message>Not too bad, I'm just a bit nervous about flying.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, we're here to ensure your safety. Before we proceed, may I please see your passport and ticket?<p class=message>Sure, here you go. *hands over passport and ticket*<p class="message sent">Thank you. Now, let's begin with the safety check. Do you have any items in your luggage that are not allowed on the flight?<p class=message>No, I don't believe I do. I made sure to double-check before coming here.<p class="message sent">Great! And have you packed any liquids in your carry-on luggage?<p class=message>Yes, I have a water bottle and a small bottle of hand sanitizer.<p class="message sent">No problem, as long as it's less than 100ml, it's allowed. Speaking of liquids, do you know the difference between "boarding" and "boredom"?<p class=message>No, what is the difference?<p class="message sent">One is the excitement of going on a trip, and the other is the feeling you get when you have to wait too long in the airport lounge!<p class="message sent">All right, I think we're ready to go. Follow me this way to the boarding gate, please.<p class=message>Thank you so much for your help, and for the joke. You've certainly made my day!<p class="message sent">My pleasure, have a safe and enjoyable flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b656ff62-ab78-4eba-a42d-c81f46d637ba.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
