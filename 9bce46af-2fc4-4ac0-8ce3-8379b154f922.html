How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Great, thanks! I'm ready to help you with our patients.<p class=message>Perfect. So, what do we have on the schedule today?<p class="message sent">We have Mrs. Smith and her husband scheduled for their annual check-up. They're always so sweet.<p class=message>Ah yes, I remember them. They always bring in some homemade cookies for us too.<p class="message sent">And don't forget about Mr. Wilson. He's coming in for his shot today.<p class=message>(laughs) Yes, Mr. Wilson always makes a bit of a fuss about that but I'll make sure to give him a little extra TLC.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. And we have a new patient too, Ms. Lee. She's a bit nervous about her first visit.<p class=message>Okay, we'll make sure to take our time and make her feel comfortable. Anything else on the schedule?<p class="message sent">We also have a follow-up with Mr. Johnson after his recent surgery.<p class=message>Great. Let's make sure to check his incision and monitor his progress. Looks like we have a busy day ahead!<p class="message sent">Yes, but we make a great team! Let's get to it.<p class=message>Agreed. And let's make sure to take a break for lunch at some point too, I'm hoping for some pizza today.<p class="message sent">I'm always down for pizza.
