The interface is looking good and the back-end is coming along nicely. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well. I've been optimizing the database queries to improve overall performance.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic to hear. Speaking of the app, have you tried using it on your iPad?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. It works like a charm!<p class="message sent">Awesome! I'm glad to hear that. Have you found any bugs or glitches in the app so far?<p class=message>Not really, but I did notice one minor issue with the font size on one of the screens.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll make sure to look into that. Thanks for letting me know!<p class=message>No problem. Hey, have you heard about that new coding language that's been gaining popularity?<p class="message sent">You mean Rust? Yeah, I've been meaning to try it out. Have you had a chance to check it out yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I've been reading up on it. They say it's faster and safer than other languages.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm interested in seeing how it compares to the languages we already use. We should definitely try it out sometime.<p class=message>Definitely. Oh, speaking of new things, did you hear about that new game that just came out on Steam?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What game is it?<p class=message>It's called Loop Hero. It's a retro-style game and it looks really fun.<p class="message sent">Ah, I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class=message>No problem. Always happy to help a fellow gamer out!<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah, same here. Speaking of games, have you tried out the new update in the mobile game we both play?<p class=message>Oh yeah, I did! They added a bunch of new features and quests.<p class="message sent">I know, right? I've been hooked on it even more since the update. It's like a whole new game now.<p class=message>I feel you. Alright, back to work. Let's push out some awesome code today!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e10a8136-6360-44b0-ba05-da03abdc28cb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
