What have you got there?<p class="message sent">Just a simple sandwich, I didn't have much time for lunch today. How about you?<p class=message>I brought some leftovers from last night. It's not the most exciting lunch, but it gets the job done.<p class="message sent">Leftovers are the best! What did you have?<p class=message>A homemade spaghetti bolognese. It's my go-to meal prep dish.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. I'm terrible at cooking. I usually just end up ordering take-out.<p class=message>Nothing wrong with that! Do you have any favorite spots around here?<p class="message sent">Yeah, there's a great sushi place down the street. Have you tried it?<p class=message>I actually haven't, but I love sushi. We should go there for lunch one day.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Speaking of food, have you heard about the new bakery that just opened up?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class="message sent">"Sweet Treats". They have the most amazing cupcakes and pastries. We should check it out sometime.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I have a major sweet tooth. Any recommendations on what to try?<p class="message sent">Definitely the chocolate ganache cupcake. It's to die for.<p class=message>Yum, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Thanks for the heads up.<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to share my favorite food spots. You know what they say, food is life!<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Lunch break is always the highlight of my day.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's a great chance to catch up with coworkers and take a break from work.<p class=message>Absolutely. Alright, I better get going. See you back at the office!<p class="message sent">Take care, have a good one!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=455611e6-232c-4ec7-a886-19dfe83f7f47.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
