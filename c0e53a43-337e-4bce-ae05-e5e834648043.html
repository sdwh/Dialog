The view is absolutely breathtaking.<p class=message>Yes, it can be quite overwhelming. Just stand here and admire the beauty for a moment. Now, let's get your camera ready.<p class="message sent">Great! Do you think we can take a selfie with the Statue of Liberty in the background?<p class=message>Of course! Let's get a little closer and snap that perfect shot. Cheese!<p class="message sent">Haha, we got it! How about we take another photo pretending to hold the statue up?<p class=message>That's a classic pose! You'll definitely want to show that off to your friends back home. Just hold out your hands, and I'll make it look like you're holding it up.<p class="message sent">Aw, it looks so real! I can't wait to show everyone. Hey, do you think we could get a photo with one of the ferry boats in the background?<p class=message>Sure thing! Let's go over there and take a photo from that angle. You look like a natural in front of the camera.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! You've been a fantastic guide. What's your favorite thing about working here?<p class=message>The view, of course! I see this magnificent statue every day, and it never gets old.
