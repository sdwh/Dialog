Why don't we start with a practice round first?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Can you explain the rules to me while we set up the game?<p class=message>Sure, so the goal of the game is to accumulate the most points by collecting resources and building structures on the board.<p class="message sent">Ok, got it. What are these colorful cards for?<p class=message>Those are action cards that give you special abilities. You can use them to help yourself or to hinder your opponent.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. This game sounds more interesting than I thought.<p class=message>Yes, and the best part is that it's not just about luck, you have to think strategically too.<p class="message sent">I'm up for the challenge. Let's get started.<p class=message>You're doing great, B. You might even beat me at this rate!<p class="message sent">Haha, don't jinx me. I'm just glad I'm understanding the game better now.<p class=message>That's the spirit! Oh, don't forget to use your action card before the round ends.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the reminder, A. I almost forgot.<p class=message>Looks like I won this time, but you still did really well for your first time playing.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I think I'm definitely going to play this game again.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. We can play again next time and with more players too.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Thanks for introducing me to this fun game.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e202b40f-7a6f-4da0-88d4-ee72ec41dda8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
