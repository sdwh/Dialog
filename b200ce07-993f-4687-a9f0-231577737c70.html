There were a few issues that popped up during the code review.<p class=message>Oh no, what kind of issues did you find?<p class="message sent">Nothing major, just some syntax errors and some places where the code wasn't optimized.<p class=message>Well, that's not too bad then. Are you going to fix them?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm working on it now. It's always good to make sure the code is clean before we submit it.<p class=message>Definitely. It's important to catch those errors early on.<p class="message sent">I agree. It saves a lot of time and headaches down the road.<p class=message>So how are you going to go about fixing the issues?<p class="message sent">I'm going to go through the code line by line and address any errors or optimization issues. It's going to take some time, but it'll be worth it in the end.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Let me know if you need any help.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate it. I might take you up on that offer.<p class=message>No problem. We're a team, after all.<p class="message sent">That's right. And we always have each other's backs.<p class=message>Exactly. Now let's get this code polished up and ready to submit.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b1feacd0-37df-4cc8-8d20-0e65aeaec090.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
