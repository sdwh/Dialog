How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thanks for asking. I'm excited about our collaboration here in the old city district.<p class="message sent">Me too, I think our authentic Thai glutinous rice dumplings and various types of tea would be a hit among the locals and tourists.<p class=message>Definitely. I heard you're famous for your traditional flavors. Would you mind telling me more about it?<p class="message sent">Sure. We have classic fillings like red bean, sesame, and peanut. But we also have unique ones like durian, taro, and pandan.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds delicious. I think it would pair well with some of our high-quality tea leaves such as oolong, green tea, and earl grey.<p class="message sent">I agree. Speaking of which, do you have any recommendations for our customers who are new to tea tasting?<p class=message>Yes, for beginner's palette, I suggest trying our fruity or floral tea like berry fusion or jasmine. Then they might proceed to our earthy or smoky types such as pu-erh or lapsang souchong.<p class="message sent">That's very informative. I'm sure our customers would appreciate the knowledge. By the way, would you like to try one of our choco-mochi balls? It's a fusion dessert that combines Japanese and Thai taste.<p class=message>Surely, let me have one. Mmm, this is amazing! I can taste the rich chocolate inside and the chewy glutinous rice outside.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it. Maybe we can provide more variants of fusion desserts in the future.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I'm excited about what we can offer our customers next time. It's been a pleasure working with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. Let's make this collaboration a successful one. Thanks for being such a helpful assistant.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2373292c-a380-4af7-9581-eae616a6954c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
