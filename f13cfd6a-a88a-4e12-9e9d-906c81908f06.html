How about you?<p class=message>Just finished up a batch of blueberry muffins. They're smelling amazing.<p class="message sent">Ooh, those sound delicious. What kind of coffee would you recommend pairing with them?<p class=message>Hmm, maybe a light roast like our Ethiopia Sidama. It has fruity notes that would complement the blueberries nicely.<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. And what about our chocolate cake?<p class=message>I'd go with something bolder, like our Sumatra Mandheling. Its earthy undertones would balance out the chocolate's sweetness.<p class="message sent">Great idea. Do you have any new pastries in the works?<p class=message>Actually, I'm experimenting with a matcha croissant. I'm hoping it'll turn out as tasty as it sounds.<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm definitely looking forward to trying that. And I've been playing around with a new cappuccino recipe using coconut milk.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. How does it taste?<p class="message sent">Really rich and creamy, with a subtle hint of coconut flavor. I think it'll be a hit with our vegan customers.<p class=message>Definitely. We always want to make sure everyone can enjoy our treats and drinks. Speaking of which, have you tried our new hazelnut latte?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard great things about it.<p class=message>It's become quite popular already. I think the nutty flavor and smooth espresso make for a perfect indulgence.<p class="message sent">I'll have to try it soon. It sounds like the perfect pick-me-up on a chilly day.<p class=message>Agreed. It's always fun coming up with new combinations and flavors to keep our customers coming back for more.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's so rewarding to see them enjoy what we create. All right, time to get back to work. See you later!<p class=message>See you!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f137cf61-0ef5-481a-a14e-059c55fa3f20.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
