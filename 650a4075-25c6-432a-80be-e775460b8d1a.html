Are you the tour guide for this fish market?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. Welcome to Tsukiji, the best fish market in Japan. Have you been here before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time. I am a fisherman and I am excited to explore what this place has to offer.<p class="message sent">Great! You came to the right place. We have the freshest seafood in the city. Let's start with some sashimi.<p class=message>That sounds great. How do I choose the best sashimi?<p class="message sent">Look for the ones with bright and firm flesh, clear eyes, and a fresh ocean smell. Also, make sure it doesn't have any dull spots or discoloration.<p class=message>Ah, I see. What about tuna?<p class="message sent">For tuna, you want the ones with a bright red color and with some fat in it. That will give you the perfect sashimi slice.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. What other seafood should I try?<p class="message sent">You should try the uni or sea urchin, it's a delicacy here. You can eat it fresh or in sushi. Also, try the grilled scallops or the giant oysters. They're delicious!<p class=message>Yum! I'll definitely try those. This is such a fascinating place. So much variety.<p class="message sent">Yes, and that's what makes it special. It's not just a fish market, it's a cultural experience. Have you tried the tea?<p class=message>Not yet. I didn't even know there was tea here!<p class="message sent">Yes, there's a small tea shop over there. They have the best green tea in the city. You have to try it.<p class=message>Thank you for the recommendation. This trip just keeps getting better and better.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you're enjoying it. That's why I love this job. I get to meet new people and show them the best of our city.<p class=message>Well, you're doing a great job. Thanks for all the tips and recommendations. I'm looking forward to trying everything.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6507d50e-56d7-4cfe-a221-c36974d6e346.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
