Have you tried the Crème brûlée here? It looks so delicious!<p class="message sent">No, I haven't tried it yet. How was it?<p class=message>It was amazing! The burnt-sugar topping was crispy and the custard was smooth and creamy.<p class="message sent">That sounds really good! I'm definitely going to give it a try. Do you think it's better than other desserts?<p class=message>Hmm, that's a tough question. I'd say it's definitely up there with some of the best desserts I've had. But it depends on your personal taste.<p class="message sent">Fair enough. I can't wait to try it! What do you think is the best way to eat it?<p class=message>I personally like to crack the caramelized topping first and then mix it with the custard. That way, you get a perfect combination of texture and flavor.<p class="message sent">Oh, that makes sense. Do you know what Crème brûlée means in English?<p class=message>I think it means "burnt cream".<p class="message sent">That's interesting! It's funny how something that sounds so fancy can have such a simple name.<p class=message>Yeah, I think that's the charm of it. It's elegant, but not pretentious.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's definitely one of my favorite desserts now. Thanks for recommending it!<p class=message>No problem! I'm just happy to share my love for Crème brûlée with someone else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1ccbbeb3-6220-452f-b242-1ef2f5d9ba1d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
