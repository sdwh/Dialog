What tech stack are we using?<p class=message>We'll be using jQuery for the front-end and ASP.NET MVC 5 for the back-end.<p class="message sent">Interesting. I haven't used jQuery in a while. Are there any new features we should be aware of?<p class=message>Well, they recently introduced a new method for handling async code, which could come in handy for some of the site's functionality.<p class="message sent">Nice. I'm excited to work on the backend. Do you have any tips for me?<p class=message>Make sure you're familiar with the MVC pattern and how to use it effectively. And always remember to keep your code organized!<p class="message sent">Good advice. And how about you? Any challenges you think you'll face on the front-end?<p class=message>Definitely. I think making the site responsive will be a bit of a challenge, but I'm ready to tackle it.<p class="message sent">I have faith in you. And who knows, maybe we'll discover some new techniques along the way.<p class=message>Yeah, that's the exciting part about working on new projects. We always learn something new.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Speaking of learning, have you read any good tech books lately?<p class=message>Yeah, I recently read "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford. It's definitely a must-read for any front-end developer.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendation. I'll have to check it out.<p class=message>No problem, let me know what you think.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b547dd21-4a4d-4df8-a4eb-f5e3682ad7eb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
