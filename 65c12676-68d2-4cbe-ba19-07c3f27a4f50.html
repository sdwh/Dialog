You mean those snails that people eat?<p class=message>Yes, it's a delicacy in France. They're cooked in garlic butter and served with bread.<p class="message sent">I don't know about that... I'm not sure I could stomach eating snails.<p class=message>Oh come on, you never know until you try it. Plus, it's supposedly really good!<p class="message sent">I guess you're right. I mean, they eat weirder things than snails in other parts of the world, right?<p class=message>Exactly! And if you decide you don't like it, at least you can say you gave it a chance.<p class="message sent">Okay, you've convinced me. Let's go find some Escargots and give them a taste.<p class=message>Great idea! I know a little cafe on the corner that serves them. We can go there.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. As long as they don't come crawling off the plate...haha!<p class=message>Don't worry, they'll be cooked and ready to eat. Just make sure to have some bread nearby to soak up the garlic butter sauce.<p class="message sent">I'll have some bread on standby, no worries. Let's go get our Escargots on!<p class=message>Yes, let's do it! I can't wait to try them again. It's been a while since I've had some.<p class="message sent">Again? So you're already hooked on these little snails, huh?<p class=message>Haha, I guess you could say that. But I promise, they're really good!
