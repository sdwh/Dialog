I need some assistance with my flights.<p class="message sent">Of course, what can I help you with today?<p class=message>I need to change my return flight due to unexpected circumstances, how can I go about doing that?<p class="message sent">No problem. Do you know what date you would like to return?<p class=message>Yes, I was thinking of returning two days later than originally planned.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me check our availability...yes, we have a few options. There will be a small change fee, though.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Can I also get a refund for my original return flight?<p class="message sent">Yes, we can process that for you. Just keep in mind that it may take a few business days to appear on your account.<p class=message>Thank you. This is my first time changing a flight, so I'm a bit nervous.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, it's a common occurrence. It's better to make the change sooner rather than later, especially if it's due to an emergency situation.<p class=message>That's true. Is there anything else I should know before making the change?<p class="message sent">Just be sure to double-check your new travel dates and times before confirming the change. And if you have any questions during the process, feel free to ask me.<p class=message>Thanks for your help. You've made this a lot easier for me.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to assist. Is there anything else you need help with today?<p class=message>That's all for now. Thanks again, and have a great day!<p class="message sent">You too.
