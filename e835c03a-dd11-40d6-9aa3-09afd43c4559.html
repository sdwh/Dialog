Isn't it some kind of security protocol for businesses?<p class=message>Absolutely. It's a standard that companies can follow to make sure their information security systems are up to par.<p class="message sent">That sounds important. But why is it called a "trail"?<p class=message>Well, it's a record of all the activity in a company's information systems. It's like a breadcrumb trail for hackers, but also for internal auditors to follow.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So it's kind of like a detective story, but for data.<p class=message>Yeah, that's one way to think about it. But it's definitely not as sexy as a detective story.<p class="message sent">Haha, no doubt. But I guess it's still important to have a good trail of evidence, even in the not-so-sexy world of data security.<p class=message>Absolutely. In fact, companies that follow ISO 27001 standards are often seen as more trustworthy and reliable by their clients and customers.<p class="message sent">Well, sign me up! I want to be seen as trustworthy and reliable.<p class=message>Haha, good attitude. But first we have to make sure our own house is in order.<p class="message sent">Right. So where do we start?<p class=message>Well, first we need to identify all the critical information assets that we need to protect. Then we can start implementing the different protocols and measures to keep them secure.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a lot of work, but I guess it's better to be safe than sorry.<p class=message>Absolutely. And if we do it right, we might even become information security superheroes!<p class="message sent">Haha, imagine that. We'll be like Batman and Robin, except for the digital age.<p class=message>Hey, it's not so far-fetched. Maybe we'll get our own comic book someday!<p class="message sent">Haha, one can only dream. But for now, let's just focus on being responsible and diligent data security professionals.<p class=message>Agreed. And hey, who knows? Maybe one day we'll look back on this conversation and laugh at how clueless we used to be.<p class="message sent">Haha, let's hope not. But I do feel more informed now, so thanks for explaining it all to me.<p class=message>No problem, B. That's what helpful assistants are for!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e833d88c-6357-4e30-b21a-5104852c3ebc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
