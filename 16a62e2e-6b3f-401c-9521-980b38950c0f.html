I heard you're a game developer. What kind of game are you working on?<p class="message sent">Hey! Yeah, I'm actually designing a historical game that takes place during the medieval period. It's still in the early stages though.<p class=message>That sounds intriguing! What makes it different from other historical games?<p class="message sent">Well, we're really focusing on the accuracy of the time period. We want players to feel like they're actually living in that era. Plus, we're adding some fictional elements to keep the game engaging and entertaining.<p class=message>Nice! Do you have any favorite medieval moments or figures that you hope to include?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm a big fan of Joan of Arc and Richard the Lionheart. We'll definitely be including them in some way.<p class=message>Cool! How about gameplay mechanics? Are there any unique ones you're incorporating?<p class="message sent">We're actually experimenting with incorporating player choices that affect the outcome of events. We want the players to feel like they have agency in the game.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Are graphics something you're focusing on?<p class="message sent">Definitely! We want the art to really draw the players in and make them feel like they're in the game.<p class=message>So cool. When can we expect to see this game released?<p class="message sent">It's still a ways off, but we're hoping to release it in about a year or so.<p class=message>Can't wait to see it! What platform will it be available on?<p class="message sent">It'll be available on PC and consoles.<p class=message>I'll have to keep an eye out for it. Thanks for chatting with me about it!<p class="message sent">No problem! Thanks for showing interest.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=16a22bec-93ec-46e7-86ac-39ee5887bfc7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
