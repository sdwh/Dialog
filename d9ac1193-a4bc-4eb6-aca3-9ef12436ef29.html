How's it going, team?<p class="message sent">Hey there! All good. Just prepping for the dinner rush.<p class=message>Love the smell of seafood in the air. What's cooking?<p class="message sent">We've got some fresh prawns, crabs and mussels that just came in this morning. Thinking of making a spicy seafood soup.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. Perfect for a chilly evening by the river.<p class="message sent">Speaking of the river, have you seen the view from the terrace?<p class=message>Yes, it's breathtaking. I think our guests are in for a treat tonight.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And the dining area is all set up with candles and flowers.<p class=message>Great job, B! Your attention to detail is impeccable.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. It's all about making sure our guests have a memorable experience.<p class=message>That's why you're the best seafood chef in the city.<p class="message sent">You flatter me, A. But I'm just doing what I love.<p class=message>And we love having you on our team. By the way, did you hear what happened yesterday?<p class="message sent">No, what's up?<p class=message>One of our customers caught a fish while dining on the terrace!<p class="message sent">Really? That's amazing. We should offer fishing as a new dining experience here.<p class=message>Ha! Maybe we should. Though I'm pretty sure the fish probably just got attracted to your cooking.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Thanks, A. But let's hope our guests don't hook their own dinner tonight.<p class=message>(chuckles) Agreed. Well, time to greet our customers. Let's make tonight a night to remember.<p class="message sent">You got it, A. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d9aaaf26-040a-420e-883f-49ce97e67cd3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
