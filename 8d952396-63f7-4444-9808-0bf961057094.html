How's it going?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It's going well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing alright. I've been busy coordinating the transportation of our livestock to the market.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a tough job. What kind of animals will you be selling?<p class=message>Mostly cows and pigs. We've had a pretty good season, so we have a decent amount to sell.<p class="message sent">Well, I hope they behave during the ride. Last time I transported a group of pigs, they were quite a handful.<p class=message>(laughs) Yes, that's always a concern. But we've taken some measures to make sure they're comfortable during the trip. Plus, I'll be going with them to keep an eye on things.<p class="message sent">That's a relief. So, how's the market looking?<p class=message>It's looking pretty good. Demand for meat has been increasing recently, so we're hoping for a good turnout.<p class="message sent">I bet you'll sell out in no time.<p class=message>(laughs) We'll see. We also have some customers who have reserved specific animals.<p class="message sent">Ah, that's great to hear. Do they usually come and pick up the animals themselves?<p class=message>Yes, some do. But others prefer to have them delivered. That's where you come in.<p class="message sent">Of course! I'm always happy to make a delivery. It's nice to have a change of scenery from the usual highway routes.<p class=message>(laughs) I can imagine. It's definitely more scenic out here in the countryside.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And speaking of scenery, how's the weather looking for the transport day?<p class=message>It's looking good so far. We want to make sure it's not too hot or too cold for the animals.<p class="message sent">That's smart. I'm sure they'll appreciate it. Well, I better get going. Lots of deliveries to make today.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I appreciate your help. Drive safely!<p class="message sent">Will do! See you soon, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8d8fac28-8b70-4666-957d-c05d6e4e05fc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
