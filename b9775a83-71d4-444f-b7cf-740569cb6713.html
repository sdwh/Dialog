Do you work for the airline?<p class=message>No, I work as a cargo handler. I help load and unload cargo on different flights.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's fascinating. Do you enjoy your job?<p class=message>It's definitely an interesting job. You get to see a lot of different things and work with all kinds of people.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of fun. What's the most interesting thing you've seen so far?<p class=message>I once loaded a shipment of exotic animals, including a live alligator. That was definitely memorable!<p class="message sent">Oh my goodness! That's incredible. Hopefully, it didn't cause any problems on the flight.<p class=message>No, the alligator was in a secure container, but it definitely caught a lot of attention from the passengers.<p class="message sent">I can only imagine! So, do you have any tips for packing cargo?<p class=message>Yes, always make sure the weight is distributed evenly and the cargo is secured tightly. Safety is the top priority.<p class="message sent">Thank you for the advice. I'll keep that in mind for my next flight. You must have a lot of experience with packing cargo.<p class=message>Yes, I've been doing this for about 5 years now. It's a challenging job, but it's also rewarding when you see everything is done correctly.<p class="message sent">It's great to hear that you enjoy your job. It's important to have a job that you find fulfilling. Thanks for all your help today.<p class=message>No problem at all.
