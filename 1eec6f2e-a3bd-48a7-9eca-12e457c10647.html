How can I assist you today?<p class="message sent">Hi. I'm in need of some legal advice regarding a recent dispute I had with my landlord.<p class=message>Sure, I'll do my best to help. Can you give me some details on what happened?<p class="message sent">My landlord is refusing to give me my security deposit back, claiming that I damaged the property. But, I believe the damage was already there when I moved in.<p class=message>I see. Did you take any pictures of the property before moving in?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I have proof that the damage was already there before I moved in.<p class=message>That's great. With that evidence, we can definitely negotiate with your landlord to return your security deposit.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! I was really worried about this situation.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. On a lighter note, have you been binge-watching any good shows lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been really into "Stranger Things" lately. Have you seen it?<p class=message>Yes, I have! I loved the 80's nostalgia and the sci-fi elements. It's a great show.<p class="message sent">Agreed! It's so addictive.<p class=message>I know, it's hard not to watch multiple episodes in one sitting.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Thanks again for your help, you've given me some peace of mind.<p class=message>Anytime. It was nice chatting with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1eeb691b-50ba-4141-a834-7ad2b0b87c05.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
