Welcome to Asakusa Temple, one of the most famous temples in Tokyo. My name is A, and I'll be your driver today. We're lucky to have B, our amazing tour guide, here to share with us the history and culture of this incredible temple.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A! Yes, Asakusa Temple was built in the 7th century and is dedicated to the bodhisattva Kannon. It's also known as Sensoji Temple and is the oldest temple in Tokyo.<p class=message>Wow, that's amazing. I didn't realize it was that old.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's full of history and tradition. The temple was destroyed several times throughout history, but it was always rebuilt by the local people who had a strong attachment to it.<p class=message>It's really impressive how the locals have taken care of it for so long. What else can you tell us about the temple?<p class="message sent">Well, we're walking through Nakamise-dori, a street lined with shops that sell traditional souvenirs and snacks. It leads to the temple's main gate, which is called Kaminarimon or the Thunder Gate. You'll see a giant red lantern hanging from it.<p class=message>I can't wait to see that lantern. And what's behind the gate?<p class="message sent">The gate opens up to a long pathway called Hozomon, which is also called the "Treasure House Gate." It leads to the main hall and houses many objects that are considered national treasures.<p class=message>That's so cool! I can't wait to learn more about this temple.<p class="message sent">There's so much more to see, so let's keep going. Don't forget to try some traditional Japanese sweets like ningyo-yaki or sakura mochi!<p class=message>Thanks for the tip, B! Let's keep walking and exploring this amazing temple together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=23dec2a7-8431-4dac-bfdc-7c89e5d50ec8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
