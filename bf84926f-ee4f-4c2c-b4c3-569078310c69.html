We're making good progress with the coding.<p class=message>That's fantastic news! Do you need help with anything?<p class="message sent">Actually, I could use some input on the user interface. What do you think about these color schemes?<p class=message>Hmm, I like the blue and green combination, but maybe we could make the buttons a bit larger?<p class="message sent">Good point, I'll make those changes. Thanks for your help.<p class=message>No problem! So, we've got a deadline coming up. How are we tracking on that?<p class="message sent">We're on schedule, but we could use more resources to speed up the process.<p class=message>I hear you. I'll talk to the higher-ups and see what we can do.<p class="message sent">Great! In the meantime, we should also schedule another team meeting to discuss progress and roadblocks.<p class=message>Agreed. And on a completely unrelated note, have you tried the hotel's chocolate cake yet?<p class="message sent">No, but it does sound tempting. Maybe we can reward ourselves with some cake when we hit a milestone?<p class=message>That's a great idea! Let's aim to finish this module by the end of the week and treat ourselves to some cake.<p class="message sent">I'm on board with that plan. Thanks for always thinking of ways to keep us motivated, A.<p class=message>Hey, it's all in the name of team spirit! Let's get back to work so we can make that deadline and enjoy some cake.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bf832c26-d1c0-44ca-88e1-7d139476ab3f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
