I'm hoping you can help me with a change in my travel plans.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What can I assist you with today?<p class=message>Well, unfortunately, I need to cancel my flight that was scheduled for tomorrow.<p class="message sent">I'm sorry to hear that. May I ask why you need to cancel?<p class=message>My plans have suddenly changed and I won't be able to make it.<p class="message sent">No problem. Would you like a refund or to change your flight to a different date?<p class=message>I think I would like to change the date, if that's possible.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Do you have a specific date in mind?<p class=message>Yes, I would like to change it to the following weekend.<p class="message sent">Okay, let me check on that for you. (pauses briefly) It looks like we have some availability. Would you like me to go ahead and make that change for you?<p class=message>Yes, please. Thank you so much!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>Actually, I do have a question about baggage. How much am I allowed to bring?<p class="message sent">Our policy allows for one carry-on and one personal item. Checked baggage allowances vary by fare type, so I can look up the specific details if you'd like.<p class=message>That would be great. Thank you for your help!<p class="message sent">Of course, happy to assist! (pauses briefly) Alright, it looks like your baggage allowance is one checked bag up to 23 kilograms.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=10a78231-8db6-40da-8a2d-b423b8dfc599.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
