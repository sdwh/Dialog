I was planning on doing that today. Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I just booked mine and I noticed the flight time was pretty long. Like, 10 hours long.<p class="message sent">Really? Wow. That's a long time to be on a plane.<p class=message>Yeah, and don't forget about the 7-hour time difference. It's going to feel like we time-traveled!<p class="message sent">Ha! Time-traveling sounds pretty cool to me. But seriously, I'll have to adjust my sleeping schedule to make sure I don't feel too jet-lagged.<p class=message>Good point. I heard drinking plenty of water and getting up to walk around during the flight can also help with jet lag.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the advice. Speaking of walking around, do you know if there are any cool shops or restaurants near our hotel in Tokyo?<p class=message>I'm not sure, but I can look it up online. Have you tried sushi before?<p class="message sent">Of course! I love sushi.<p class=message>Oh, that's great. I heard Tokyo is known for having some of the best sushi restaurants in the world.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. I'm definitely looking forward to trying some authentic Japanese sushi.<p class=message>Me too. Hey, have you thought about what you want to do while we're in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Not really. I know I want to check out some of the shrines and temples, but other than that, I'm open to suggestions.<p class=message>How about going to a sumo wrestling match? Or visiting a traditional hot spring?<p class="message sent">Those both sound really interesting. I've never been to a sumo match before.<p class=message>Yeah, it's a pretty unique experience. And the hot springs are great for relaxing after a long flight.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It sounds like we've got quite the itinerary planned for our trip to Tokyo.<p class=message>Yeah, I can't wait. It's going to be an adventure!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1910bd07-372d-43e7-8110-4f53e2afe58a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
