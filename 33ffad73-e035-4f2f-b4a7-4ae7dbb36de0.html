How was your day?<p class="message sent">It was busy as usual, but I'm glad we're getting more customers these days.<p class=message>Speaking of customers, did you see that one lady who kept taking photos of her food?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I think she's an influencer or something. Our dishes must be Instagram-worthy.<p class=message>Haha, absolutely! Our food not only tastes good, but it also looks good.<p class="message sent">By the way, I have a new recipe I want to try. It's a twist on the classic dim sum dish - Ha Gow.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting. What's the twist?<p class="message sent">Instead of shrimp, we'll use crab meat and add a little bit of cheese to the filling.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds delicious. I can't wait to try it.<p class="message sent">That's why I need your help to prepare the crab meat. Let's work on it tomorrow.<p class=message>Sure thing. But can we also make some shrimp dumplings for me? Ha Gow is my favorite.<p class="message sent">Of course, we can't forget our traditional dishes. Shrimp dumplings it is.<p class=message>Thanks, Boss. Speaking of traditional dishes, have you heard about the new restaurant that serves fusion Cantonese food?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. But I'm confident that our authentic Cantonese food will always be a hit.<p class=message>I agree. Plus, we know how to keep things interesting. Remember when we added truffle oil to our fried rice?<p class="message sent">That was a great idea. We should definitely do something like that again soon.<p class=message>I'm glad you liked it, Boss. I'm always looking for ways to elevate our dishes.<p class="message sent">And that's why you're a great chef, A. Keep up the good work.<p class=message>Thank you, Boss. I'm grateful to be able to work with you and learn from you.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A. Let's continue to make delicious food and keep our customers coming back for more.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=33f3d392-e95b-481f-a157-8265ed58b029.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
