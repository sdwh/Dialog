How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing great, thanks! Just got in and checking on how everything went with the breakfast service. How's the day looking so far?<p class=message>Not bad, we had a decent crowd this morning. The omelette station was a huge hit, as always.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Speaking of which, have you thought about adding any new items to the menu?<p class=message>Actually, I have been playing around with a few ideas. I was thinking of trying out a crab cake benedict or possibly a breakfast burrito with homemade salsa.<p class="message sent">Both sound delicious! Let's plan a tasting for the staff to try out the new items and see how they do with customers.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Hey, did you hear about the customer who came in yesterday and asked for chicken fried bacon?<p class="message sent">(laughs) You've got to be kidding me! What did you tell them?<p class=message>I politely told them that we don't serve that dish here, but recommended some other bacon dishes we do offer on our menu.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Well, I guess they can't blame a hungry Texan for trying, can they?<p class=message>(laughs) Definitely not. So, what's on your agenda for the day?<p class="message sent">Mostly administrative stuff, but I do have a meeting with a potential new supplier for our meats. They're known for their high-quality cuts, so I'm excited to see what they can offer.<p class=message>Nice! It's always great to find suppliers who care about quality as much as we do. Well, I better get back to the kitchen. See you later, B!<p class="message sent">Take care, A! And keep up the good work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d1f83b61-620a-4fbe-8d5f-0727ff168bfb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
