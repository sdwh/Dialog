How are we all feeling today?<p class="message sent">Hey there! Feeling pretty good, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. So, today's task is to brainstorm some new online marketing strategies. Any ideas?<p class="message sent">Well, we could do a social media takeover with some influencers. That always gets a lot of engagement.<p class=message>Great idea! Which platform are we thinking? Instagram or TikTok?<p class="message sent">I was thinking Instagram. We could reach a wider audience there.<p class=message>Agreed. Has anyone been following any viral trends we could incorporate?<p class="message sent">I've seen a lot of people doing dance challenges lately. We could have an influencer create one for our product.<p class=message>Love it. And we could make a hashtag for users to participate and repost.<p class="message sent">Speaking of hashtags, we could also try a Twitter party. It's a fun way to interact with users and gain followers.<p class=message>That's a good idea. And maybe we could offer some online discounts to party participants.<p class="message sent">How about a giveaway? We could create a social media contest with prizes for the winner.<p class=message>Yes! And we could use a tool like Rafflecopter to make it easy to enter and track entries.<p class="message sent">I also think we should start a blog to share product news and informative articles related to our industry.<p class=message>Great suggestion. We can have guest bloggers and even do a podcast.<p class="message sent">Wow, we have a lot of ideas. I'm excited to see how they all come together.<p class=message>Thanks, team! Let's get to work on our next steps.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=46cce03e-dd9e-480f-ada3-f8fb9b77bfcd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
