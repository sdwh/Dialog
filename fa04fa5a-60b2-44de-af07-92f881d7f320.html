What did you work on yesterday?<p class="message sent">I mainly concentrated on fixing some bugs in the code. I also discussed the project status with C and D.<p class=message>OK, sounds great. What do you plan to work on today?<p class="message sent">Today, I'm planning to work on developing new features for the project. Also, I'll conduct a code review with E and F to ensure the quality of the code.<p class=message>Awesome, keep up the good work. By the way, have you tried the new coffee machine in the break room?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I did. It's amazing! It makes my morning much better.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Maybe we should organize a coffee tasting event after work!<p class="message sent">That's a cool idea! Let's do it. By the way, I heard that G is going for a vacation next week. Who will cover his tasks?<p class=message>Don't worry, we have a plan in place.
