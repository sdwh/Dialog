I heard you have a seafood restaurant nearby.<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. The seafood we serve is fresh and locally sourced.<p class=message>That sounds great! I am a fisherman and I caught some fresh fish today.<p class="message sent">Excellent! What kind of fish did you catch?<p class=message>I caught some snapper, grouper, and mahi-mahi.<p class="message sent">Wow! Those are some tasty fish. I'd be interested in purchasing some from you.<p class=message>Sure thing! I can sell them to you at a reasonable price.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic. As a restaurant owner, I always prefer to offer freshly caught seafood to my customers.<p class=message>I understand.
