I'm your surfing instructor for the day. What's your name?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm a travel photographer! I just wanted to capture some cool shots while I'm here.<p class=message>That's awesome! Sounds like fun. Are you planning on trying surfing too?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm not too good at it. I tried once and nearly drowned.<p class=message>Oh, don't worry about that. I'll make sure you're safe and enjoying yourself out there.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's give it a go.<p class=message>Great! So first off, let's go through the safety rules and gear. You'll need a wetsuit, a board, and a leash.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. So how do I stand up on the board?<p class=message>It's all about balance and timing. Lie on your stomach on the board with your hands on either side, then pop up quickly to a crouching position as the wave approaches.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds tricky.<p class=message>It takes some practice, but you'll get the hang of it. And don't worry, I'll be right next to you the whole time.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's do this!<p class="message sent">I think I'm getting the hang of it! And the view from out here is amazing.<p class=message>Yes, the Gold Coast has some of the best surf in the world. And you're doing great!<p class="message sent">Thanks, it's so much fun.<p class=message>Alright, let's call it a day. How did you enjoy your experience?<p class="message sent">It was fantastic! I got some great shots and learnt some new skills.<p class=message>Glad to hear that. Don't forget to share your photos with us on social media.<p class="message sent">I will! And thanks for being such a great instructor.<p class=message>No worries, anytime. And who knows, maybe we'll see you on the pro circuit someday.<p class="message sent">Haha, let's not get ahead of ourselves. But I definitely wouldn't say no to another lesson.<p class=message>Awesome, we'll make sure to give you a discount as a returning customer!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e7e9e208-c68c-4dc6-9c79-75eeb390f45a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
