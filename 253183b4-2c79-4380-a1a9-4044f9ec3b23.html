Let me grab my balls and I'll get started.<p class="message sent">Wow, you're pretty good at this. Do you perform anywhere else besides the streets?<p class=message>Yes, I do.

That's why I appreciate you stopping by to check out my show.<p class="message sent">Well, you're welcome! You definitely deserve the attention. Have you ever had any mishaps during a performance?<p class=message>Oh, yes. I've dropped my juggling balls numerous times and even fallen once or twice.
