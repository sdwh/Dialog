How's it going?<p class="message sent">It's going good, A. Just busy with automating our software deployment process for the insurance company we are working on.<p class=message>Yeah, I noticed we have been spending a lot of time on it. I wonder if there's an easier way to approach it?<p class="message sent">Well, we can definitely streamline the process by taking advantage of DevOps methodologies such as continuous integration and delivery.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. Can you explain more about continuous integration?<p class="message sent">Simply put, continuous integration is the practice of automatically building and testing code changes multiple times a day. It helps us identify issues early on and ultimately lead to faster releases.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like it would save us a lot of headaches.<p class="message sent">Exactly, and with continuous delivery, we can automatically deploy these changes to production, making our lives even easier.<p class=message>It's amazing how much technology has advanced to make our jobs easier.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And I think it's important for us to keep staying updated with these technologies to stay ahead of the curve.<p class=message>Absolutely. Speaking of staying ahead, do you know any good programming memes we can share in the next stand-up?<p class="message sent">Haha, I have a few saved. Let me pull them up.<p class=message>Perfect, I can't wait to see them.<p class="message sent">*shows memes*<p class=message>These are hilarious! Definitely sending these out.<p class="message sent">Glad you like them. It's good to have some humor to break up our workflow.<p class=message>For sure. And thanks for all your hard work on the deployment process. Let's grab some lunch to celebrate when we go live.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. I'm looking forward to it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d5fca4d4-16e6-45a4-8bd1-911b10760f4a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
