Nice to meet you. I'm the cloud engineer for this project.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm the data scientist. It's great to meet you too.<p class=message>So, first things first, we need to figure out how we're going to handle all of this data.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's a lot. But I think with the right cloud tools and technologies, we should be able to manage it.<p class=message>Definitely. Have you worked with any specific cloud tools before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've used AWS and Google Cloud before. They both have some really powerful data analytics tools.<p class=message>Oh, that's great to hear. I've been focusing more on Azure, but I'm sure there's some overlap in terms of capabilities.<p class="message sent">For sure. We should take a look at each platform's offerings and see which one is the best fit for this project.<p class=message>Sounds good. And what about storage? Do you have any preferences there?<p class="message sent">I usually work with S3 buckets for storing large amounts of data, but I'm open to other options if you have any suggestions.<p class=message>S3 is definitely a good choice. I also like Azure Blob Storage. It's pretty similar in terms of functionality.<p class="message sent">Cool, let's plan on using one of those. And how about running the actual analysis? Are we going to use something like Hadoop or Spark?<p class=message>Yeah, I was thinking we could use Spark to distribute the analysis across multiple nodes. Should give us some good performance gains.<p class="message sent">Definitely. That should help us handle the scale of the data without too much trouble.<p class=message>Agreed. So, let's get started on some more detailed planning and see if we can get this project up and running in the cloud!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=605bd732-6fa2-439d-a8fd-30fe2ee7b673.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
