I'm a teacher at a nearby school and I'm looking for some new books for our library. Can you recommend any titles?<p class=message>Of course! What subjects are you interested in?<p class="message sent">Well, we're always trying to encourage our students to read more diverse books, so anything that promotes cultural awareness would be great.<p class=message>I recommend "The Hate U Give" by Angie Thomas. It's a powerful and thought-provoking book about racial discrimination and police brutality, and it's received a lot of critical acclaim recently.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect, I'll definitely add it to our collection.<p class=message>Great! You might also want to consider "When Dimple Met Rishi" by Sandhya Menon. It's a fun and heartwarming romance novel that also explores themes of cultural identity and family expectations.<p class="message sent">Oh, I've heard of that one! I'll definitely check it out.<p class=message>And if you're looking for something more lighthearted, "Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine" by Gail Honeyman is a charming and witty novel about a quirky loner who learns to open up to the people around her.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great addition to our library's collection. Thank you so much for your help!<p class=message>My pleasure! Let me know if you need any more recommendations.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8b4b3500-e680-4feb-9801-e30d6c58f4d5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
