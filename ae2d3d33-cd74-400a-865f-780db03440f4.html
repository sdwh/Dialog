And what can I get you to drink?<p class="message sent">Do you have any local beers?<p class=message>Yes, we have a few from nearby breweries. Would you like to try the Shanghai Brewery Pilsner?<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds good. So how did you get into making dumplings?<p class=message>Well, my grandmother taught me how to make them when I was young, and I've been perfecting my recipe ever since.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. And do you have any tips for making the perfect dumplings?<p class=message>Definitely make sure the filling is well-seasoned and chopped evenly, and try to keep the edges sealed tightly so the juice doesn't leak out while cooking.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. And is there a particular type of dipping sauce that goes well with your dumplings?<p class=message>We make our own special sauce with soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, and garlic. It's the perfect balance of sweet, salty, and sour.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious. I'll have to try it. So what other dishes do you specialize in?<p class=message>We also make scallion pancakes, Chinese bao buns, and daily specials like seafood pancake and lamb skewers.<p class="message sent">Yum, I'll have to come back and try more of your menu. Thanks for the recommendations.<p class=message>Of course, we're always happy to share our passion for good food and drinks. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ae2d3929-4179-4c43-81df-78985e67d662.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
