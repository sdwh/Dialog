How may I assist you?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon, I have a reservation under the name John Smith.<p class=message>Great! Let me check that for you. Ah, here it is! You will be staying with us for three nights, is that correct?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right.<p class=message>Wonderful. Before we proceed, may I see your photo identification and credit card?<p class="message sent">Sure, here you go.<p class=message>Perfect! Thank you, Mr. Smith. Just a heads up, we have a daily resort fee of $25. Is that okay with you?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's fine. What amenities does the resort fee cover, by the way?<p class=message>It covers access to our pool, fitness center, beach chair and towel service, and Wi-Fi, among others.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Do you have any recommendations on good restaurants nearby?<p class=message>Definitely! There's Joe's Stone Crab, which is known for its seafood. Or if you want a steakhouse, there's Prime 112. Both are just a few minutes' walk from here.<p class="message sent">Those sound great. Thank you. Can I request a room with a beach view?<p class=message>Certainly! I'll try my best to accommodate that request. Would you like a king bed or two queen beds?<p class="message sent">A king bed, please.<p class=message>Noted. Your room is on the 10th floor with a beautiful view of the Atlantic Ocean. You will also have a balcony.<p class="message sent">That's perfect. Thank you very much, A.<p class=message>You're welcome, Mr. Smith. Enjoy your stay here at Miami Beach Hotel!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=529dc388-6aef-4a24-8d3f-e0d0e0d21a84.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
