I thought it was pretty reasonable for the Gold level.<p class="message sent">Well, I guess it depends on how much you value your English skills!<p class=message>True, but think of it as an investment in your future job prospects!<p class="message sent">That's a good point, but I'm still trying to save up for a vacation.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Maybe you could put aside a little each week until you can afford it?<p class="message sent">That's actually a great idea. Maybe I can cut back on some of my other expenses too.<p class=message>Yeah, think of all the extra tax deductions you'll get if you can improve your language skills!<p class="message sent">Haha, that's a good point. Plus, my friends won't make fun of my accent as much!<p class=message>Exactly! And who knows, maybe you'll even impress your boss with your newfound fluency.<p class="message sent">I never thought about that. I just hope I don't embarrass myself during the speaking section!<p class=message>Don't worry, we can practice together. I'm pretty confident in my English skills at the Gold level.<p class="message sent">Thanks, that would be really helpful. Maybe we can even make it a competition to see who gets the higher score.<p class=message>Oh, it's on! May the best English speaker win!<p class="message sent">Haha, you're going down!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6c46be8d-38bc-4c4e-89c6-81ba1c829b0f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
