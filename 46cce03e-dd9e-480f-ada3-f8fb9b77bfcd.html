How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm feeling good too. So, we're here today to discuss the materials for our upcoming course. Did you bring any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Yes, I brought a few options that I think would be great for our students.<p class=message>Awesome, let's take a look at them. What's the first one on your list?<p class="message sent">I found a book that has some interesting short stories that would be great for reading comprehension practice. It also has vocabulary exercises and discussion questions.<p class=message>That sounds like a good choice. What's the level of difficulty for the stories?<p class="message sent">I think it's suitable for intermediate level students, so it should be perfect for our class.<p class=message>Great, what else do you have?<p class="message sent">I also found a website with grammar exercises and interactive activities that could be useful for our grammar lessons.<p class=message>Sounds like a useful resource. Have you tried it yourself?<p class="message sent">Yes, I tried a few exercises and they seemed engaging and informative.<p class=message>That's important. We want our students to enjoy the learning process. How about speaking practice materials?<p class="message sent">I found some interesting TED Talks that would be good for listening and speaking practice. They cover a wide range of topics and are quite engaging.<p class=message>That's an excellent suggestion. The students will benefit from exposure to different accents and ideas. So, do you think we have enough materials for the course?<p class="message sent">Yes, I think we do. We can also supplement these materials with some activities and games to make the classes more fun.<p class=message>Absolutely. We should make sure to balance our lessons with different types of activities. Thank you for your suggestions, B. I think we have a great plan for our course.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=46cc855a-98b7-4ecb-962a-197ce2ada345.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
