I'm the photographer for this shoot. You must be the model.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's me! I'm excited to get started.<p class=message>Great! So, what are we thinking for the first set of shots?<p class="message sent">I was thinking we could do something playful, like jumping in the air.<p class=message>I love that idea! Let's find a good spot for it. How about over by those rocks?<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. Should I change into outfit number one?<p class=message>Yes, please. I'll set up the lighting and we'll go from there.<p class="message sent">Wow, the ocean looks amazing from here.<p class=message>It really does. Okay, let's start with a few test shots.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. *starts jumping*<p class=message>Okay, that was great! Let's try a few more and see if we can get the perfect shot.<p class="message sent">*continues jumping* How was that one?<p class=message>Perfect! We got it.<p class="message sent">Awesome. What's next on the agenda?<p class=message>Let's move down the beach a bit and get some shots of you walking on the shore.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. *changes into outfit number two*<p class=message>This spot here has some great waves crashing in the background.<p class="message sent">I really like the look of those pebbles on the sand. Can I stand on them?<p class=message>Absolutely! It'll give the shot some texture.<p class="message sent">*perches on the pebble* How's this?<p class=message>Love it. Let's get a few more shots here and then head over to that pier for the final set.<p class="message sent">Perfect. I'm having so much fun with this.<p class=message>Me too!
