Can I help you with anything today?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm the manager for XYZ Airlines and I was just passing by. I noticed things can get pretty hectic during peak hours.<p class=message>That's right. We're always looking for ways to improve our security measures.<p class="message sent">Have you considered employing more advanced technologies, like body scanners or facial recognition?<p class=message>We have, actually. In fact, we recently installed some body scanners in one of our terminals. But we're also mindful of privacy concerns.<p class="message sent">That's understandable. What about the process for carrying liquids? Have you thought about revising that?<p class=message>We've experimented with a few different methods, like having passengers put their liquids in a separate bin for scanning. But we haven't found a perfect solution yet.<p class="message sent">How about a designated area for passengers to dispose of their liquids before they reach the security checkpoint?<p class=message>That could work. It would definitely save some time during screening. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class="message sent">No problem. By the way, have you heard any funny stories from people trying to sneak in prohibited items?<p class=message>Oh, we've seen it all. One time, someone tried to bring a live lobster in their carry-on bag.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You're kidding!<p class=message>Not at all. We have a policy against live animals, so we had to confiscate it.<p class="message sent">I can't even imagine the conversation that person had to have with the lobster.<p class=message>(laughs) Right? Anyway, thank you for stopping by and sharing your thoughts with us.<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Good luck with the ongoing improvements!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=25c7c7dd-5a6f-468b-b073-65d26deb9a88.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
