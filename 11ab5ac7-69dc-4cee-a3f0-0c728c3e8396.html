Which type of visa are you interested in?<p class=message>I'm looking at the tourist visa, I've always been curious about the Great Barrier Reef.<p class="message sent">Oh nice! That's definitely a must-see. Have you done any research about the visa requirements?<p class=message>Not really, what do I need to prepare?<p class="message sent">You'll need a valid passport, proof of funds, and a return ticket. It's pretty straightforward.<p class=message>That's good to know. How long does the application process usually take?<p class="message sent">Processing times vary, but it could take up to a few weeks. Just make sure to apply early.<p class=message>Gotcha. How about the weather in Australia, what's it like there?<p class="message sent">Australia is a big country, so it really depends on where you're headed. But generally, it's sunny and warm, perfect for a beach getaway.<p class=message>Sounds amazing. Speaking of beaches, have you been to one in Australia?<p class="message sent">I have! I visited Bondi Beach in Sydney and it was amazing. The water was crystal clear and the sand was soft.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a dream. I can't wait to go there myself.<p class="message sent">I'm sure you'll have an incredible time. Australia has so much to offer, from stunning scenery to delicious food.<p class=message>Speaking of food, what do you recommend trying out?<p class="message sent">You have to try the classic Australian dish called meat pie. It's a savory pie filled with minced meat and gravy, and it's delicious.<p class=message>That sounds mouthwatering. I can't wait to try it out. Thanks for your help!<p class="message sent">Anytime! Let me know if you have any more questions about the visa application process.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=11a53474-b675-43ab-9a24-72cd5154b1d4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
