I'm just working on fixing some issues with our code.<p class=message>Ah, I see. What kind of issues are you running into?<p class="message sent">Well, we ran a source code scan and found some vulnerabilities that need fixing.<p class=message>That can be frustrating, but at least you caught it early. How are you planning to fix those vulnerabilities?<p class="message sent">Mostly by patching the code where necessary and updating the versions of the libraries we're using.<p class=message>That sounds like a good plan. Do you need any help with that?<p class="message sent">Actually, yeah. I'm not really sure what the best approach is for some of these issues.<p class=message>No problem. Let's take a look at the code together and see if we can figure it out.<p class="message sent">That would be really helpful, thanks.<p class=message>Sure thing. So what's the first issue you're seeing?<p class="message sent">It looks like we've got some SQL injection vulnerabilities in our login form.<p class=message>Ah, okay. That's definitely something we need to fix. Let's take a closer look and see what needs to be updated.<p class="message sent">Alright, sounds good.<p class=message>Here's what I think we should do...<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Thanks for showing me that.<p class=message>No problem. We'll just need to test things out and make sure everything's working as expected.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's always better to take the time to fix things correctly, rather than rush it and create more problems later on.<p class=message>Absolutely. Plus, it's good to learn from these experiences so we can improve our coding practices in the future.<p class="message sent">Yeah, definitely. Thanks for your help, A.<p class=message>Anytime. Let me know if you run into any more issues, and we can work through it together.<p class="message sent">Will do. Thanks again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dc51bf78-5f06-411f-a811-aad8f0c33ca3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
