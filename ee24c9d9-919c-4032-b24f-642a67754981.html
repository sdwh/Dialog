How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Hi, thank you for seeing me. I've been feeling really stressed lately and I don't know how to deal with it.<p class=message>I'm sorry to hear that. Stress can be a difficult thing to manage. Can you tell me more about what's been causing your stress?<p class="message sent">School has been really overwhelming, and I have a lot of exams coming up soon. On top of that, I'm trying to balance my extracurricular activities.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot to handle. Have you tried any stress-relieving techniques like meditation or exercise?<p class="message sent">I've tried going for runs, but it doesn't seem to help much. I haven't tried meditation though.<p class=message>Meditation can be a great way to calm the mind and reduce stress. I can give you some resources on it if you'd like.<p class="message sent">That would be great, thank you. Do you have any other tips for managing stress?<p class=message>Of course! It's important to take breaks and give yourself time to relax. Try doing something you enjoy, like reading or listening to music.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll try that.
