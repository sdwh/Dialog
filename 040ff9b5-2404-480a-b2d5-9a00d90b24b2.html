Welcome to our farm. Have you picked fruit before?<p class="message sent">Hi! No, I haven't. I'm really excited to try it though.<p class=message>Awesome, well today we're picking oranges. Let me show you how to find the ripe ones.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Thanks for showing me.<p class=message>So, you want to look for oranges that are bright orange in color and feel heavy in your hand.<p class="message sent">Got it! How do I pick them?<p class=message>Just gently twist the orange and it should come off easily. Here, you can try picking this one.<p class="message sent">Wow, this is so cool! I never realized how much work went into picking fruit.<p class=message>It can be hard work, but it's also really rewarding. And the fruit tastes even better when you pick it yourself.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to taste these oranges. Do you sell them here on the farm?<p class=message>Yes, we do. We also have other fruits like apples and pears.<p class="message sent">That's great to know. How long have you been running this farm?<p class=message>Our family has been running this farm for generations. It's a labor of love.<p class="message sent">That's really impressive. It must take a lot of dedication to maintain a farm like this.<p class=message>Yes, it does. But it's worth it.<p class="message sent">I agree. This experience has been amazing so far.<p class=message>I'm glad you're enjoying it. Would you like to pick some more oranges?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I want to bring some home with me.<p class=message>Sounds good. Let's get back to picking.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0404969d-308a-4db1-b616-43894683e8c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
