And the suspect replied, "I was at home, Watchin' TV with ma mama!"<p class="message sent">Haha, that's a classic answer. Did the police officer believe him?<p class=message>Nope, not at all. So the police officer asked, "What were you watching on TV?" And the suspect replied, "Uh... I was watching, uh... the weather channel!"<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's a terrible alibi! So, did they catch the suspect?<p class=message>Yeah, eventually they did. The police officer found some evidence and it led him to the suspect. And, do you know what the suspect said?<p class="message sent">What?<p class=message>"Aw man, why you gotta be so good at your job?!"<p class="message sent">(laughs) I guess he got caught red-handed! But at least it was a funny story.<p class=message>Yeah, it goes to show you that you can't outsmart the law!<p class="message sent">Definitely, especially if you got a good detective on your case. Well, thanks for sharing that story A, it was entertaining.<p class=message>No problem, anytime B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4c1e61e9-c307-4b47-a9a9-ca5840e74688.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
