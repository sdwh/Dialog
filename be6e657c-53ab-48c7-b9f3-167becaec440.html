Do you know if we have a coffee maker in the room?<p class="message sent">Hey, I'm not sure. Let me take a look. Hmm, I don't see one, but there is a kettle for hot water.<p class=message>Okay, I guess I'll have to go down to the lobby for my caffeine fix. But at least we have a mini-fridge for my snacks.<p class="message sent">Agreed! And look at this closet - it's huge! I could practically live in here.<p class=message>Haha, that's true. But have you seen the bathroom? It's like a spa retreat in here.<p class="message sent">Yes, I know! The bathrobe is so soft and fluffy. I might have to take it home with me.<p class=message>You'd better not, or we'll both get charged for it. But speaking of charges, do you know if the hotel offers a complimentary breakfast?<p class="message sent">I don't think so, but I heard there's a cute little cafe next door that serves amazing pastries.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds delightful. And after all the eating, we can hit the gym to work it all off.<p class="message sent">Or we could take a dip in the pool. I heard it's heated.<p class=message>That's even better. I can't wait to relax and enjoy all the amenities this hotel has to offer.<p class="message sent">Same here! Let's make the most of our stay here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=be6e4645-3c6a-45e8-bda5-ac489e6a5c17.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
