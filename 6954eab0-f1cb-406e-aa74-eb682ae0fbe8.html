Interesting, right?<p class="message sent">That is interesting. I wonder if we could capitalize on that with a new marketing campaign.<p class=message>Definitely! We could run a promotion where customers can get a free sample of our best-selling product in its smallest size.<p class="message sent">I like that idea. It'll give customers a chance to try it out and hopefully lead to more sales for us.<p class=message>Another thing we found in the data is that our customers are most likely to buy our products on the weekends.<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe we could set up promotional booths in shopping centers on weekends to attract more customers.<p class=message>Great idea, and we could hand out free samples to entice people to try our products.<p class="message sent">Speaking of free samples, have you thought about partnering with restaurants to offer samples of our products with their meals?<p class=message>I was just thinking the same thing! We could reach a wider audience and give our customers a chance to try our products in a different setting.<p class="message sent">Exactly! And since we know our small size is the top-seller, we could offer that size as the sample.<p class=message>I think this marketing plan is shaping up nicely.<p class="message sent">Agreed, we just need to tweak a few details and get started.<p class=message>Sounds good, let's get to work and make it happen!<p class="message sent">Definitely, let's go!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=695084c0-39cb-4b2b-b7f0-4791f9a4f31c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
