How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It was great, I went hiking with my friends. How about you?<p class=message>I had a relaxing weekend, just catching up on some reading. So, have you had a chance to work on your assignment?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! But I'm still struggling with the second question. Can you give me some tips?<p class=message>Sure, I'd love to help. What's the question about?<p class="message sent">It's about the difference between "affect" and "effect". I always get confused between the two.<p class=message>Ah, that's a common mistake. "Affect" is a verb, meaning to influence or change, while "effect" is a noun, meaning result or outcome.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. So, if I want to say that something had a strong influence on me, I should use "affect".<p class=message>That's correct! You're catching on quickly. Let's move on to the next topic. Did you know that Shakespeare invented many English words?<p class="message sent">Really? I didn't know that. Can you give me an example?<p class=message>Sure, how about the word "manager"? Shakespeare used it for the first time in his play "A Midsummer Night's Dream". Pretty cool, right?<p class="message sent">That is very interesting! Shakespeare was such a genius. What's our next topic, A?<p class=message>Our next topic is phrasal verbs. Do you have any trouble with those?<p class="message sent">Yes, I do. I find them really confusing.<p class=message>Don't worry, we'll break them down together. Let's start with "bring up". It means to raise a topic for discussion.<p class="message sent">Like "My mother always brings up my grades during dinner"?<p class=message>Yes, exactly! You're getting the hang of it.<p class="message sent">Thanks for teaching me, A! I feel more confident now.<p class=message>You're very welcome, B! Keep up the good work.
