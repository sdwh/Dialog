I'm excited to solve some puzzles.<p class=message>Great! Just a heads up, this game is known for its tricky challenges.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I've been practicing my detective skills.<p class=message>Okay, let's get started. Here's our first clue: "I am not alive, but I grow. I don't have lungs, but I need air. What am I?"<p class="message sent">Hmm, sounds like a tough one. Let's think it through. It doesn't have lungs but needs air? Maybe it's something that needs oxygen.<p class=message>That's a good point. But it also says it grows. Oxygen isn't really something that grows, is it?<p class="message sent">Maybe it's a plant? They need air to survive and they grow.<p class=message>You're right! The answer is a plant.<p class="message sent">Nice! We make a great team.<p class=message>Yes, we do. Let's move on to the next challenge.<p class="message sent">Looks like we have to find hidden objects in this room. Let's work together and search every nook and cranny.<p class=message>Good idea. I'll start looking over here and you can search the other side.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Wait, I think I found something!<p class=message>Great job! What did you find?<p class="message sent">A key! It was stuffed behind this picture frame.<p class=message>That could be crucial for unlocking something later on. Let's keep searching.<p class="message sent">Will do. This game is starting to get really exciting.<p class=message>Yeah, and we're making good progress. I'm sure we'll crack this mystery in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2266b0a0-170f-40c1-b662-ecfa876bcd55.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
