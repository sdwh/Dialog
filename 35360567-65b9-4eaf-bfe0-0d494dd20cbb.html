Our pool is one of our pride and joy here at the hotel. It's open from 6 am to 10 pm.<p class=message>Wow, that's a long time. Is it heated?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do have temperature control. So even if it's a bit chilly outside, you can still enjoy a dip.<p class=message>Great! Are there any rules we should know about using the pool?<p class="message sent">Yes, please keep in mind that this is a public space. So for everyone's comfort and safety, we ask that you wear appropriate clothing and refrain from any loud or disruptive behavior.<p class=message>That makes sense. May I ask if there are any food and drink restrictions at the pool area?<p class="message sent">We kindly ask that you don't bring any glass containers around the pool. But don't worry, we have a full-service bar nearby that serves refreshing drinks and light meals so that you can enjoy them while you swim.<p class=message>Wonderful. Do you provide towels and other pool accessories like goggles and floaters?<p class="message sent">Yes, we provide all of that. Just ask our front desk staff, and they'll be happy to assist you.<p class=message>Fantastic, we'll definitely check it out later. Thank you for the information!<p class="message sent">Our pleasure. Have a great time at the pool!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=35331157-1591-4a0e-b862-a653bea48fd8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
