Welcome to our airport parking lot. Are you here to rent a car?<p class="message sent">Good morning! Yes, I work for a car rental company and we have a reservation for a customer who's flying in today.<p class=message>Great! I can direct you to our rental car center. Is this your first time here?<p class="message sent">No, we've been renting from your company for a few years now.

Also, do you have any suggestions for parking spots for rental cars?<p class=message>Yes, you can park them in the designated spots in our parking lot so they'd be easy to find for your customers.<p class="message sent">Thank you very much for your assistance.
