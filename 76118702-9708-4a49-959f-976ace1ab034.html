Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Hi there! Welcome to Guangzhou. What can I get for you to taste?<p class=message>Hmm...how about some dim sum? What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">You have to try the siu mai and har gow, they're our specialties here.<p class=message>Mmm...delicious! The siu mai has the perfect combination of pork and shrimp, and the har gow is so juicy.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it.
