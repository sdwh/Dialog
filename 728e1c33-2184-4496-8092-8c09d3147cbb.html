Just been busy with this new project we're working on.<p class=message>Yeah, me too! It's been really exciting though, being able to work on a social networking site from scratch.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And I'm glad we have a good balance of front-end and back-end skills on our team.<p class=message>For sure. I think our site is going to look and function great with both of our expertise.<p class="message sent">Agreed. But sometimes it feels like we're speaking different coding languages.<p class=message>Haha, yeah. That's why it's important to communicate and collaborate effectively. Have you had any more ideas for the site's design?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. I was thinking we could add some cool animations to make it more visually appealing.<p class=message>Sounds awesome. I love adding animations to my projects. Do you need any help with that?<p class="message sent">Thanks A, but it's covered. I have a good handle on it.<p class=message>No worries. Anything else you need me to cover while you work on that?<p class="message sent">How about improving the site's server response time? I think that would be a great addition.<p class=message>Sure thing, I'll work on that. And maybe we can grab some celebratory drinks after we launch the site!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan to me. But let's get this project finished first!<p class=message>Agreed. Let's keep up the great work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=72862863-85cd-4aab-8b58-c9fb3bc1ec46.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
