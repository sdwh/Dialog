I heard you're working on a new desktop game.<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm doing well, thanks for asking! Yes, I'm currently designing a game called "Escape the Room."<p class=message>Sounds interesting! What's it about?<p class="message sent">It's a puzzle game where the player tries to escape from a series of increasingly difficult rooms by solving clues and finding hidden objects.<p class=message>That sounds like a challenge. What kind of puzzles do you have planned?<p class="message sent">I'm incorporating a mix of brain teasers, riddles, and logic puzzles. It should keep players on their toes!<p class=message>I'm sure it will. What kind of settings are you working on?<p class="message sent">Right now, I have a haunted mansion, a spaceship, and a medieval castle. Each one will have its own unique challenges to solve.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. What platform will the game be on?<p class="message sent">It will be available on both Windows and Mac. We're also working on a mobile version for iOS and Android.<p class=message>Wow, that's awesome! How long do you think it will take to complete the game?<p class="message sent">I'm hoping for around 10-12 hours of gameplay, but it could be longer depending on the difficulty level.<p class=message>Sounds like a good amount of content. Will there be any multiplayer modes?<p class="message sent">Not at launch, but we're considering adding a co-op mode later on.<p class=message>I bet players would love that. What's the release date?<p class="message sent">We're aiming for a release in the fall, but it depends on how much work we have left to do.<p class=message>Got it. Well, good luck with the rest of the development. I can't wait to try out the game!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I'll make sure to send you a copy when it's ready.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1842b1f9-dbd8-45a5-bdf9-b55d36bc4590.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
