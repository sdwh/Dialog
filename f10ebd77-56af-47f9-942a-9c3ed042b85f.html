Nice to finally have another player to join in on our poker game.<p class="message sent">Hey, yeah. I'm excited to play. What kind of game are we playing?<p class=message>We can play Texas Hold'em, that's usually a fun one.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, let's deal.<p class=message>Alright, here are your cards. Don't worry, I won't peek.<p class="message sent">Haha, good to know. So, how often do you play poker?<p class=message>I've been playing for a couple of years now. It's a great way to pass the time and exercise your mind.<p class="message sent">I hear you. I mostly play online, but it's nice to play with real people every now and then.<p class=message>Definitely. Plus, you get to interact with others and have some friendly competition. It's a win-win situation.<p class="message sent">Agreed. So, are you going to call or raise?<p class=message>Hmm, let me think about it. I don't want to mess up my winning streak.<p class="message sent">Haha, I'm sure you'll do just fine. I'm going to raise a little bit and see how it goes.<p class=message>Okay, sounds good. Let's see if luck is on our side today.<p class="message sent">Well, that was a fun game. Thanks for having me over.<p class=message>Of course, anytime. It was great playing with you. Maybe next time we can switch it up and play a different game.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that would be awesome. Looking forward to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f10e96e4-df8c-4a3f-b582-40d1dcad01a6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
