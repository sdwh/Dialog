I guess they really love our fried chicken.<p class=message>Yeah, we must be doing something right. By the way, have you thought about trying out new recipes and flavors for our menu?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. I've been experimenting with a new spicy Korean fried chicken recipe. Want to try it out later?<p class=message>Definitely! And maybe we can add it to the menu if it's good enough.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Speaking of new things, have you seen the latest kitchen gadgets that just came out?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's new?<p class="message sent">There's this new air fryer that promises to make fried foods healthier without sacrificing the taste.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, I'm definitely skeptical about that. But it's worth a try.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And speaking of trying things, have you tried that new coffee shop next door?<p class=message>I haven't had the chance. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, they've got the best coffee I've ever tasted. You should definitely give it a try.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation. I'll definitely check it out.<p class="message sent">No problem. And let me know what you think about that spicy Korean fried chicken later.<p class=message>Will do. Keep up the good work frying those chickens, B.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You got it, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=159b4022-3c68-4824-ac63-d110cad64cb1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
