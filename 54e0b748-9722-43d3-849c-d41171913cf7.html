I'm heading to Marseille. Can you take me there?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Hop in and buckle up. It's going to be a smooth ride.<p class=message>Great! Thanks for your time. How long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving taxis for 10 years now. It's a great way to meet new people.<p class=message>That's really interesting! Do you have any funny or memorable moments while on the job?<p class="message sent">Oh, I have plenty! Once I picked up a passenger who was late for a job interview and ended up walking out with a job offer. Another time, a group of tourists ended up singing karaoke in the back seat.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun! Have you been to Marseille before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's a beautiful city. Do you have any plans for your trip?<p class=message>Yes, I'm planning to visit the Notre-Dame de la Garde and stroll along the Vieux-Port.<p class="message sent">Those are great choices. You should also try some bouillabaisse while you're there. It's a local specialty.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation! I'll definitely try it. Do you have a favorite dish from Marseille?<p class="message sent">I love the panisses. It's made from chickpea flour and deep-fried. It's a great snack.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. I wish I had more time to try everything. Thanks for the ride and the great tips!<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Enjoy your time in Marseille!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=54d7bc96-190c-44f5-a7b3-bade04821214.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
