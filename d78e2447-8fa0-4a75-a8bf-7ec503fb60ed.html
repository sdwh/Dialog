Can you help me out?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'd love to be your volunteer guide! Let's start at Namba, which is a shopping district known for its street food.<p class=message>Street food? I'm all ears. What's your go-to snack here?<p class="message sent">Takoyaki is a must-try! It's a ball-shaped snack with a piece of octopus inside, topped with savory sauce and mayo.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! What else should I try while I'm here?<p class="message sent">You should also check out Okonomiyaki, a savory pancake filled with various ingredients like pork, shrimp, and cheese.<p class=message>Yum! I'll definitely have to try those. What else is there to do in Osaka besides eat?<p class="message sent">You can visit Osaka Castle, a stunning feudal-era fortress. You can also check out the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan, which houses an impressive collection of marine life.<p class=message>Wow, Osaka sounds amazing! Are there any customs or traditions that I should be aware of?<p class="message sent">Yes, when entering a temple or shrine, it is customary to bow and cleanse your hands and mouth with water before praying. It's also important to remove your shoes before entering a Japanese-style room.<p class=message>Thank you for letting me know. I'll make sure to be respectful of the local customs.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>Actually, do you know of any unique souvenirs I can take back home?<p class="message sent">How about some Japanese snacks or a traditional Japanese tea set? Or, if you're feeling adventurous, you can purchase a colorful kimono or yukata.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Thank you so much for all of your help.<p class="message sent">No problem, it was my pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your trip in Osaka!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d785201c-43f1-4a6e-a7ea-1f87176d7984.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
