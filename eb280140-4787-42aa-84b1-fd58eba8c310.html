It's like every five minutes, they're sharing something new.<p class=message>Is it just me or is it weird that they're so comfortable sharing their entire life story online?<p class="message sent">I know, right? It's like they don't even care who sees it.<p class=message>I bet they have a spreadsheet of all the chat groups they're in.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Seriously, they're probably a member of at least 50.<p class=message>I can't even keep track of one group chat. How do they do it?<p class="message sent">I don't know, but they're always happy to fill me in on the latest chat drama.<p class=message>Same here, but my favorite is when they post cat memes. Who doesn't love a good cat meme?<p class="message sent">Oh, I know. I've laughed so hard at some of them that I nearly fell off my chair.<p class=message>It's just funny how they can be so open online, yet so reserved in real life.<p class="message sent">Maybe it's easier for them. But I think we should tell them to take a break and spend some time in the real world.<p class=message>Definitely. Plus, we should plan a fun activity for all of us to do together.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Sounds like a great idea. I'm sure our chat-addicted friend will love it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eb277d23-6c0d-4923-826c-9d11574c7b58.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
