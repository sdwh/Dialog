I'm the network security engineer. Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hello, nice to meet you too. I'm the system administrator.<p class=message>Great! So, let's get down to business. We need to discuss how we can build a secure and reliable network infrastructure for our company.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. We need to make sure that all our data is safe and secure.<p class=message>First things first, we need to identify and assess all the possible threats to our network.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And then we need to come up with a plan to mitigate those threats.<p class=message>That's correct. We also need to implement strict access controls and make sure that all our employees follow proper security protocols.<p class="message sent">Definitely. In addition, we should regularly update all our software and hardware to ensure that we are using the latest security technologies.<p class=message>Agreed. And we also need a disaster recovery plan in place, just in case something does go wrong.<p class="message sent">Right. We should perform regular backups and test our disaster recovery plan to make sure it works.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we should also have a clear incident response plan in place.<p class="message sent">True. It's important to have a quick and effective response to any security incidents.<p class=message>That's right. It sounds like we have a lot of work to do, but I'm sure we can create a secure and reliable network infrastructure for our company.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's going to be challenging, but it will be worth it in the end.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=74a87ac4-819f-493f-b9a6-b4f82810a686.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
