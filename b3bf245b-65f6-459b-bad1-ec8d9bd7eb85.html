It's a beautiful day today, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Good morning, grandpa! Yes, it is. I love this park, it's so peaceful.<p class=message>Me too! Did you see those ducks in the pond?<p class="message sent">Yes, they're so cute. Can we feed them?<p class=message>Of course, here's some bread I brought. Let's see if they come closer.<p class="message sent">Look, they're coming towards us! They must have heard us.<p class=message>It's always been a tradition for me to feed the ducks in this park. I used to come here with your mother when she was your age.<p class="message sent">Really? That's cool! Mom would love to hear that.<p class=message>Speaking of your mother, how is she doing? I haven't seen her in a while.<p class="message sent">She's doing great, grandpa. She's been really busy with work, but she sends her regards.<p class=message>That's good to hear. How about you, how's school going?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thanks for asking. I actually have a big project due next week.<p class=message>Oh, what's it about?<p class="message sent">It's about the solar system. We have to create a model and present it in class.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds interesting. Do you need any help with it?<p class="message sent">That would be great, grandpa! Would you like to help me with it?<p class=message>I'd love to. Let's go get some supplies and work on it together.<p class="message sent">Awesome, thanks grandpa! You're the best.<p class=message>Anytime, my dear grandson. It's always a joy spending time with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b3bd92d0-bcff-40ff-8161-3f3a6868fa46.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
