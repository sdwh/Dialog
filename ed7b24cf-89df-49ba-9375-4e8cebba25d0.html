It looks incredible.<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! I can't wait to see how it tastes in the spicy tuna rolls.<p class=message>Speaking of spicy, have you tried the kimchi fried rice yet? It's one of our most popular dishes.<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've had my eye on it. Maybe we can make some for ourselves after our shift.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Have you ever tried making your own kimchi?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I've always been too scared to attempt it. Have you made it before?<p class=message>Yes, a couple of times actually. It's not as hard as it seems, and the flavors are so worth it.<p class="message sent">Maybe you can give me a quick lesson sometime.<p class=message>Absolutely! Oh, did you see that couple at table 8? They keep taking photos of every dish.<p class="message sent">Yeah, they've been doing that all night. Maybe they're food bloggers.<p class=message>Or just really avid Instagram users. Either way, I hope they tag us in their posts!<p class="message sent">That would be great promotion for the restaurant. Hey, did you hear the manager is thinking of adding some new dishes to the menu soon?<p class=message>No, I hadn't heard that. I hope we get to try them out before they're officially added.<p class="message sent">Me too. I don't want to be caught off guard if someone asks us about them.<p class=message>That's true. But I have faith in our cooking skills. We can handle anything that comes our way.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And at least we know we won't be hungry after our shift, with all this delicious food around us.<p class=message>That's for sure. Alright then, back to work. Let's keep these customers happy and fed!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed758ecb-e5a2-4dae-ae7c-1672740a7419.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
