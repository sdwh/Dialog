Can I see your boarding pass and ID, please?<p class="message sent">Sure, here you go. By the way, do you have a moment to talk about the security screening process?<p class=message>Of course, sir. We're always looking for ways to improve. What's on your mind?<p class="message sent">Well, I've noticed that the lines can get pretty long during peak hours, and some passengers complain about the wait time.<p class=message>Yes, that's true. We're trying to process everyone as quickly as possible while still maintaining safety standards.<p class="message sent">I understand. Have you considered adding more staff during busy times or maybe even pre-screening certain passengers to speed things up?<p class=message>We've actually been looking into both of those options. It's all about finding the right balance between efficiency and security.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And what about using newer technology? I've seen some airports with full-body scanners that can detect dangerous objects without the need for pat-downs.<p class=message>Yes, we're using some newer scanners already, but it's always good to keep up with the latest advancements.<p class="message sent">Well, it sounds like you're already doing a great job. Keep up the good work!<p class=message>Thank you, sir. We're always striving to provide the best service possible. Have a great flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5212ba46-ead3-4b34-b170-c39ddd31d5df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
