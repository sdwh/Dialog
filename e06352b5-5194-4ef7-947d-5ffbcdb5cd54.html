It's scary how personal information can get exposed so easily.<p class=message>Absolutely. We need to find ways to prevent this from happening in our own institution.<p class="message sent">I agree. We need to have a robust security system and strict policies in place.<p class=message>Also, I think it's important that we educate our students and staff about the dangers of phishing scams and social engineering.<p class="message sent">Yes, awareness and training are key. And let's not forget about using strong passwords and regularly updating software.<p class=message>That's right. We should also implement two-factor authentication and limit access to sensitive data.<p class="message sent">And let's make sure any physical documents with personal information are stored securely and disposed of properly.<p class=message>Good point. We should also have a plan in place in case a breach does occur, so we can minimize the damage.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's important to have a response team ready to act quickly and effectively.<p class=message>You know, this conversation is making me consider changing all my passwords right now.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Better safe than sorry, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. Thanks for the great discussion. Let's make sure our institution stays safe and secure.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It was great talking with you, too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e063093c-b5ab-402c-b4c6-67cd5a2f8a85.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
