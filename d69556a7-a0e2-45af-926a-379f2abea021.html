I'd be happy to help. Can you tell me what you've been doing so far?<p class=message>Well, I've been doing some interval training and practicing my stride length, but I still feel like there's room for improvement.<p class="message sent">One thing I would suggest is working on your foot placement. When your foot hits the ground, it should be positioned directly underneath your body, not too far in front or too far behind.<p class=message>That's a good point. I'll definitely focus on that during my next run.<p class="message sent">Another thing to keep in mind is your posture. You want to keep your shoulders relaxed and your back straight, which will help you breathe more efficiently.<p class=message>I've also heard that strength training can help improve running. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Resistance training can help build the muscles that support you while running, like your glutes and hips. Plus, it's a great way to switch up your exercise routine.<p class=message>That's a great idea. I'll look into some exercises I can do at the gym.<p class="message sent">And don't forget to include rest days in your training schedule. Your body needs time to recover in order to perform at its best.<p class=message>That's something I struggle with. I always feel like I need to be working out every day.<p class="message sent">Rest is just as important as exercise, A. It allows your muscles to repair and rebuild themselves, which ultimately leads to better performance.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice coach! I'm excited to incorporate these tips into my training regimen.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. Keep up the good work and don't forget to have some fun while you're at it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d6946f28-1c37-4cb5-88cd-9365ca73d2cb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
