Is everything going well with the store's security measures?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Yes, thanks for asking. We just finished our yearly security audit and everything is in order.<p class=message>That's great news to hear. Have you had to turn away many people due to the new health restrictions?<p class="message sent">Not too many, but we are definitely being vigilant about ensuring that everyone follows the guidelines.<p class=message>Right, it's important to keep everyone safe while also maintaining normal operations as much as possible.<p class="message sent">Exactly. But I'm curious, have you noticed any particular types of incidents happening at the entrance that we need to be aware of?<p class=message>Well, we have had some issues with people trying to enter with large bags or backpacks, which isn't allowed according to our store policy.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. We'll remind our customers about that. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.<p class=message>No problem. Also, we've had some individuals try to sneak in through the exit door. We're catching them, but it's still a security concern.<p class="message sent">Thanks for letting us know. We'll make sure to monitor both entrances more closely.<p class=message>Sounds good. Is there anything else I can help with?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. We're thinking about upgrading our security cameras. Do you have any experience with that?<p class=message>Yes, I do. I can recommend some vendors we've worked with before and give you some advice on which systems might be the best fit for your store.<p class="message sent">That would be fantastic. Thank you, A. Your help is always appreciated.<p class=message>Of course! I'm here to ensure that our customers and staff feel safe and secure at all times.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b48c6d61-e486-4eb9-8527-9dc9a5ad32f1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
