I'm just checking in and wanted to know if the rooms have a bathtub?<p class="message sent">Yes, they do! I saw it in the pictures when I booked the hotel.<p class=message>That's awesome! I love taking a warm bath after a long day of exploring.<p class="message sent">Me too! It's the perfect way to relax and unwind. Have you noticed if the shower also has good water pressure?<p class=message>Actually, I haven't tried the shower yet. But I do know that the shampoo and conditioner they provided smells amazing.<p class="message sent">Oh really? I'll make sure to try them out. Speaking of good scents, have you been to the spa in the hotel?<p class=message>No, I haven't had the chance. Is it worth checking out?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I had a massage there yesterday and it was heaven. They even had a jacuzzi in the spa area that was incredibly soothing.<p class=message>Wow, you're making me jealous! I might have to book a spa treatment for myself now.<p class="message sent">I highly recommend it! And make sure to try out the sauna as well. It's perfect for sweating out any toxins.<p class=message>Sounds fantastic. Thanks for the tips, B! I can already tell this is going to be a great stay here.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b70141b0-b9a6-4ffe-8172-f5f2552de9b3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
