Can you recommend some places to visit here in Osaka?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Sure, there are plenty of things to see and do around here. Have you tried takoyaki yet? It's a famous food in Osaka!<p class=message>Not yet, but I would love to try it. Where can I find the best takoyaki in Namba?<p class="message sent">There are many takoyaki stalls around here, but I would recommend the one near the entrance of Dotonbori. It's called Kukuru and they serve the best takoyaki in town!<p class=message>That sounds great! I'll definitely try it later. Could you also tell me more about the culture here in Osaka?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Osaka is known for its friendly and outgoing people, and also its love for food and entertainment. We also have many traditional festivals and events held throughout the year.<p class=message>That's interesting! Do you have any upcoming festivals that I should check out?<p class="message sent">Yes! We have the Tenjin Matsuri coming up next month. It's one of the biggest summer festivals in Japan with a lot of traditional performances and fireworks. It's definitely worth checking out!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing! I'll make sure to add it to my itinerary. By the way, what are these small shrines that I see around the streets?<p class="message sent">Those are called "komainu" which are guardian dogs that protect the shrine. They are an important part of Japanese tradition and are believed to ward off evil spirits.<p class=message>I see. Thank you for the explanation. I'm really enjoying my time here in Namba. It's such a lively and colorful place to be in.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! I'm glad you're enjoying your stay.
