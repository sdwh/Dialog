It's a beautiful day for a road trip, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I can't think of a better place to go than Hokkaido. Have you been there before?<p class=message>No, it's my first time. I'm looking forward to trying out all the culinary delights I've heard so much about.<p class="message sent">Oh trust me, as a local I can assure you that you won't be disappointed. But of course you have to try the King Crab, it's a specialty here.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! What's the best way to enjoy it?<p class="message sent">Well, I recommend going to a place that serves it really fresh, and with some butter sauce on the side. You won't regret it!<p class=message>I'm sold! What about activities? What do you suggest we do once we get there?<p class="message sent">For starters, Hokkaido is famous for its winter activities like skiing and snowboarding. But even in summer, you can go hiking or visit the local hot springs and relax.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun. I'll definitely keep that in mind.<p class="message sent">And if you like animals, there's a great zoo featuring Arctic animals like polar bears, which is one of the biggest attractions in Hokkaido.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds amazing. I think my trip is already planned, thanks to you!<p class="message sent">No worries! Just make sure to bring warm clothes, it can get pretty chilly even in summer.<p class=message>I will remember that. Thanks for the advice, you're a great tour guide!<p class="message sent">Aw shucks, don't mention it. Have a safe and enjoyable trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=04d384f3-edcd-4cbd-a98f-e3d427c7a4c1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
