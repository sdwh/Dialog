How's the back-end development of our social media platform coming along?<p class="message sent">Hey A! It's going pretty well! I've been developing some algorithms for our user data analysis and it's been keeping me busy. How about the front-end development?<p class=message>It's been a bit challenging but I'm enjoying the designing and the CSS styling. It's always nice to see the visual side of the website come to life.<p class="message sent">Definitely agree! Hey, have you heard of the "404 Not Found" error page?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. What about it?<p class="message sent">I was thinking it would be cool if we could design a custom 404 page that could entertain users if they ran into any errors while browsing the site. What do you think?<p class=message>That's a great idea! We can add some humor to it and make it an interactive page. I'll add it to our to-do list.<p class="message sent">Speaking of humor, have you seen the latest meme trend on social media? It's all about the 'coding struggles' we face every day.<p class=message>Haha, yes I've seen it! Some of them are so relatable. Makes me wonder why we chose this profession!<p class="message sent">Don't worry, A. We just need to find the right solution to every problem. You know what they say, 'coding is the new magic'.<p class=message>That is so true! With every line of code we write, we create something new and wonderful.<p class="message sent">Exactly! Hey, I gotta go back to coding. It's been a pleasure chatting with you. We should grab a drink after we launch the website.<p class=message>Definitely, I look forward to it! Good luck with the back-end and I'll see you around.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Bye, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d14b3323-b04b-4375-a664-1a78d6c89794.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
