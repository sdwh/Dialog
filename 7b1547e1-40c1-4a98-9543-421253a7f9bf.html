It's a staple food in many countries.<p class=message>Yeah, that's true. I love how versatile it is. You can have it as a main dish or just as a side.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I use rice for my sushi and also for my fried rice. It's so delicious.<p class=message>Speaking of fried rice, have you ever tried jasmine rice? It's perfect for making that dish.<p class="message sent">Oh really? I've only used basmati rice for mine. I'll have to give jasmine rice a try.<p class=message>You definitely should! It has a fragrant aroma and it's super fluffy. Plus, it's healthier than white rice.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. I'm always trying to eat healthier. What about brown rice? I know it's supposed to be really good for you.<p class=message>It is! It's a great source of fiber and essential minerals. But let's be honest, it doesn't taste as good as white rice.<p class="message sent">Haha, I know what you mean. I always feel like I'm sacrificing taste for health when I eat brown rice.<p class=message>Same here. That's why I like to mix my brown rice with white rice to compromise. Have you ever tried that?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But that's a brilliant idea! I'm definitely going to try that next time.<p class=message>Awesome! Let me know how it turns out. And speaking of rice, I'm getting hungry just talking about it. Let's go grab some lunch?<p class="message sent">Sure, I know this great sushi place nearby. They have the best rice.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7b14368a-ead1-4914-881f-1af1483107eb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
