How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was great, thanks for asking! I went hiking with some friends at a nearby mountain.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you see any wildlife?<p class="message sent">Yes, we saw some deer and a few birds. It was amazing!<p class=message>Speaking of birds, did you know that some birds have the ability to mimic human speech?<p class="message sent">Really? I had no idea! Which birds can do that?<p class=message>Well, the most famous one is the African Grey Parrot, but there are also some species of mynas and crows that can mimic human speech.<p class="message sent">That's so interesting! I might have to research that for a biology paper.<p class=message>Speaking of research, have any of you started thinking about your final project?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I was thinking about exploring the history of comic books and their impact on pop culture.<p class=message>That sounds like a great topic! Have you read any comic books yourself?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Iron Man is my favorite superhero.<p class=message>Iron Man? I prefer Batman myself, but to each their own!<p class="message sent">Yeah, I can respect that. Batman is pretty cool too.<p class=message>Alright class, let's get started on today's lesson.
