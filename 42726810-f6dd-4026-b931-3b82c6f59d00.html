It's great to finally meet you, B. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! I'm a self-proclaimed coffee addict and I run my own coffee shop in the city.<p class=message>That's awesome! I'm a big coffee drinker myself. What's the best selling drink in your shop?<p class="message sent">Our signature drink is called the "Caramel Macchiato". It's a customer favorite and always a hit.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! So, what made you decide to open up your own coffee shop?<p class="message sent">I've always had a passion for coffee and I wanted to create a space that not only served great coffee but also had a cozy atmosphere where people could come and unwind.<p class=message>That's really cool. Speaking of atmosphere, I love the decor in your shop. Who came up with the design?<p class="message sent">Thank you! I actually designed everything myself. I wanted to incorporate rustic elements with a modern twist.<p class=message>You did a great job! So, what sets your coffee shop apart from all the others in the city?<p class="message sent">I think it's the personal touch. I make an effort to get to know my customers and their preferences. Plus, all the coffee is freshly roasted in-house, which makes a huge difference in taste.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive! Do you have any plans in the works for expanding your business?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I'm in the process of creating a mobile coffee truck that will bring the same great coffee and atmosphere to different events around the city.<p class=message>That's fantastic! I can't wait to try it. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me, B.<p class="message sent">Of course, thank you for coming by! And anytime you need a caffeine fix, you know where to find us.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=42718550-2524-4ca7-a3ae-10ccee24bed9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
