Business seems to be picking up here.<p class=message>Definitely! Ever since we started offering your delicious brews with our grilled fish, people can't seem to get enough.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear it. I heard the aroma of the fish drew in quite a few patrons while I was brewing next door.<p class=message>It's a match made in heaven. Speaking of which, have you tried our latest fish seasoning yet?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. What makes it special?<p class=message>It's a blend of spices that brings out the natural flavor of the fish without overwhelming it. And it pairs perfectly with your beer.<p class="message sent">Sounds enticing. I'll have to try it sometime.<p class=message>Definitely should. Say, have you ever considered a special brew just for our restaurant?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. I was thinking of using some of the herbs and spices in your seasoning to enhance the flavor of the beer.<p class=message>That's genius! We could call it the "Grilled Fish Ale".<p class="message sent">I love it! I'll start experimenting with some recipes and see what we can come up with.<p class=message>Great, can't wait to taste it. And in the meantime, let's keep serving up some deliciousness to our happy customers.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's continue making Clarke Quay the go-to spot for the perfect combination of grilled fish and refreshing beer.<p class=message>Cheers to that!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=02f5b9e9-857b-47e4-a615-259a42066327.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
