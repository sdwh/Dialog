What are we working on today?<p class=message>We need to add some more features to the registration page.<p class="message sent">Alright. What kind of features were you thinking of?<p class=message>I thought it would be cool to have a section where users can select their favorite game genre.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. It'll help us recommend games that they might be interested in.<p class=message>Exactly. And I think we should also add an option for users to upload a profile picture.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I'll start working on that now.<p class=message>Great. And while you're doing that, I'll add a section for users to enter their gaming skills and experience.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great addition. We want to make sure the site caters to all types of gamers.<p class=message>Yes, and maybe we can even incorporate some kind of ranking system based on skill level.<p class="message sent">Ooh, that would be fun. I can't wait to see how this all turns out.<p class=message>Me too. Hey, do you want to take a break and play a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors?<p class="message sent">Sure, why not? You're on!<p class=message>(laughs) Okay, ready? Rock, Paper, Scissors!<p class="message sent">(laughs) You got me. Nice one. Alright, back to work?<p class=message>Back to work. Let's make this the best gaming website out there.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=57c0f704-ec71-4a4a-b977-47de6ffc02ea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
