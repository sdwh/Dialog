I heard we're implementing ISO 27001 Asset Management in our company.<p class="message sent">Yup! It's a big deal. Our assets are important and we need to manage them properly.<p class=message>Absolutely. But to be honest, I'm not entirely sure what that means.<p class="message sent">No worries, it basically means we need to keep track of all our important stuff and make sure it's protected.<p class=message>Okay, that makes sense. But how do we even begin to manage all of our assets?<p class="message sent">Well, we need to identify them first. Everything from equipment, software, and data needs to be accounted for.<p class=message>Got it. And once we know what we have, what's next?<p class="message sent">We need to assess their value and determine how critical they are to our business.<p class=message>This sounds like a lot of work. Can we hire a team of experts to handle this?<p class="message sent">I wish! But honestly, it's everyone's responsibility to make sure our assets are protected. We can all do our part to make it easier.<p class=message>Okay, so how do we make sure we're following the ISO 27001 Asset Management guidelines?<p class="message sent">We need to establish policies and procedures, and regularly review and update them to ensure we're meeting the requirements.<p class=message>Phew, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, we'll make it fun! We'll have a shredding party to get rid of any outdated documents.<p class=message>Now that sounds like my kind of party!<p class="message sent">See? ISO 27001 can be fun! We'll protect our assets and have a blast doing it.<p class=message>I'm excited to get started. Thanks for explaining everything to me, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=70d9acc9-1c84-41de-9937-623fdb1fdec1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
