Are we all set with the safety check?<p class="message sent">Yes, we are. It's always good to be safe than sorry.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. I would never want to compromise on safety while flying.<p class="message sent">That's very responsible of you, sir. Speaking of which, have you packed anything sharp in your bag?<p class=message>Not that I am aware of. But my wife did pack my shaving kit. Does that include shaving razors?<p class="message sent">Yes, sir, it does. We'll need to confiscate it or put it in a checked bag.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Better safe than sorry, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, sir. We don't take any chances when it comes to the safety of our passengers.<p class=message>Well, you certainly seem to be doing a great job. I feel much safer knowing that you're on duty.<p class="message sent">Thank you, sir. It's always a pleasure serving the passengers and ensuring their safety.<p class=message>By the way, do you have any recommendations for in-flight entertainment?<p class="message sent">We have a wide variety of movies and TV shows to choose from. I suggest checking out our new releases section.<p class=message>Great idea! I'll do that. Thanks for your help.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, sir. Have a safe flight and enjoy your journey.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d5003133-f9c6-4656-ad3f-aaf420243efc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
