How's your day?<p class="message sent">Hey, good morning A. I'm doing great. Just had my cup of coffee. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. So, let's discuss the progress we made in the first quarter of the year.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. We've completed most of the tasks assigned to us. We just need to wrap up the last few bits by the end of the month.<p class=message>That's great news. What about the second quarter? Do we have anything lined up?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do. We have a few new projects coming up that we need to start working on. I'm pretty excited about them!<p class=message>That's awesome. How do you plan to manage your time for these projects?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of working on them in sprints. We can break them down into smaller tasks and complete them one by one. That way, we can keep track of our progress.<p class=message>That's a great idea. We don't want to fall behind. Speaking of which, how's the progress on the project we started last month?<p class="message sent">We're right on track. We've completed the first phase of development and we should be able to deliver it by next week.<p class=message>Perfect. We're killing it this year!<p class="message sent">Haha, yes we are. But let's not forget to take a break every now and then. We don't want to burn out.<p class=message>I totally agree. How about we head out for lunch today? My treat.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Let's go grab some burgers.<p class=message>Alright then, let's get back to work and finish up the last few tasks for this month.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ed953ec3-46e4-4b03-9ade-6a86b8e8b774.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
