How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing pretty well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks for asking. What do you feel like having for lunch today?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm not really sure. I'm in the mood for something light, maybe a salad or a sandwich.<p class=message>That sounds like a good idea. Have you tried the new cafe down the street? They have some really delicious options.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Well, I've heard their turkey and avocado sandwich is amazing, and their Greek salad is really fresh.<p class="message sent">Ok, let's check it out then. Do you want to split something with me?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds good. Let's get the sandwich and the salad and share them.<p class="message sent">Great idea. So, how was your weekend?<p class=message>It was pretty good. I went hiking with some friends on Saturday and then spent Sunday relaxing at home. How about you?<p class="message sent">I went to a concert on Saturday night and then spent Sunday doing some errands and catching up on laundry.<p class=message>What concert did you go to?<p class="message sent">It was a jazz concert at the park downtown. It was really nice.<p class=message>That sounds like fun. I haven't been to a concert in ages.<p class="message sent">We should go to one together sometime. I know of a really great venue that has live music every weekend.<p class=message>That sounds awesome. Let's definitely plan on that.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Oh, our food is here! Let's dig in.<p class=message>Yum, this looks delicious. I'm so glad we decided to come here.<p class="message sent">Me too. Thanks for recommending it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=20f05768-73f4-4cd4-b9c5-45f6becbc3df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
