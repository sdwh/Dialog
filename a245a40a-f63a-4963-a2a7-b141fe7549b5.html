How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I am doing well, thanks! Just trying to find your herd of cows.<p class=message>They're just over that hill. We have about 100 cows that need to be transported to the market.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a lot of cows! Do they all have names?<p class=message>Haha, no, unfortunately, we don't have the time to name every single one. But we definitely recognize some of their personalities.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. I hear that some farmers give their cows massages to keep them relaxed before transport. Do you do that here?<p class=message>(laughs) No, we haven't tried that yet. But we make sure they're well-fed, hydrated, and comfortable during the ride.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. So, when do you plan to sell them?<p class=message>We're hoping to sell them within the next week. We have a lot of people interested in our high-quality meat.<p class="message sent">Great! I'm looking forward to transporting them safely and efficiently. And who knows, maybe I'll even buy some for myself!<p class=message>(laughs) Well, if you need any recipe ideas, let me know. We have some delicious ones that we could share with you.<p class="message sent">I'd love that! Maybe I could even bring some samples to my wife.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Our beef is definitely something to rave about.<p class="message sent">It sounds like it! Well, I better get ready to load up the cows. Thanks for your help, and I'll see you soon!<p class=message>No problem! Have a safe trip, and we'll stay in touch!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a240e373-6068-42b5-9832-a47e2a562ac7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
