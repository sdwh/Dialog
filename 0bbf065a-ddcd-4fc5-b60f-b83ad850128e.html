I'm the pastry chef here at our booth. How's business?<p class="message sent">Hey! Good to hear. It's been alright so far. How about you?<p class=message>Same here, pretty steady. I've been loving your freshly squeezed juices. Do you mind if I try one?<p class="message sent">Of course! Have a taste of our mixed berry juice. It's our bestseller.<p class=message>Mmm, that's really refreshing. What kind of berries did you use?<p class="message sent">It's a mix of blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries. It's perfect for this hot weather.<p class=message>Absolutely! And speaking of perfect, have you tried our chocolate-dipped macaroons?<p class="message sent">Not yet, actually. But they look amazing! I'll take a few.<p class=message>Great! Let me know if you like them. We also have some lemon tarts and fruit-filled muffins.<p class="message sent">Ooh, sounds tempting. How about a trade? I'll give you some fresh oranges in exchange for some of those tarts.<p class=message>Deal! And have you seen the pet clothing section over there? They have the cutest outfits for dogs.<p class="message sent">Really? My sister has a little shih-tzu. I'll have to check it out and surprise her.<p class=message>Yes! And don't forget to try the grilled pork skewers. They're a must-try here.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendation! Business is picking up now. I'll leave you to it. See you soon!<p class=message>Same to you. Take care and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0bbd1a4c-46cb-4ae5-95b8-7e42fcdca0c3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
