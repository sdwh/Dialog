They're a type of gemstone, right?<p class=message>Yes, exactly! I was thinking of getting a ruby necklace for myself.<p class="message sent">That sounds nice, but what about that diamond bracelet you wanted?<p class=message>Oh, I can have both, can't I? Plus, rubies are my birthstone.<p class="message sent">Really? I didn't know that. Good thing we're here at this online jewelry store.<p class=message>Yeah, I'm looking at this pendant with a small ruby in the center. What do you think?<p class="message sent">Hm, it's a bit small, don't you think? You deserve something bigger and bolder.<p class=message>(laughs) You know how to flatter me. Alright, let's filter the options by size.<p class="message sent">How about this one? It's a heart-shaped ruby surrounded by tiny diamonds.<p class=message>Oh, I love it! (clicks Add to Cart) Okay, we're getting closer to checking out.<p class="message sent">Don't forget about the warranty, especially since it's an online purchase.<p class=message>Good point. Let's add the two-year warranty, just in case. Alright, I think we're done here.<p class="message sent">Finally, I was starting to get antsy. (laughs)<p class=message>Hey, you're the one who wanted to explore all the options.<p class="message sent">Yeah, but it's worth it to see you smile. (smiles)<p class=message>(blushes) You always know how to make me happy. Alright, let's check out and wait for our new ruby necklace to arrive!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=89a14458-2aae-4df5-88b9-5d4d7b20f9d0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
