How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too, sir! I'm doing great. Ready for my day on the road.<p class=message>That's great to hear! So, do you enjoy being a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I get to meet so many interesting people like you and also explore different parts of the city.<p class=message>I totally agree with you. Speaking of which, do you have any recommendations for a first-timer to Sydney like me?<p class="message sent">Of course! The Opera House and Harbour Bridge are iconic landmarks that you wouldn't want to miss. And make sure you also visit Bondi Beach for a scenic view.<p class=message>Those are amazing suggestions. Thanks a lot! So, how long have you been driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">It's been about 10 years now. Time flies when you're having fun!<p class=message>You must have some crazy stories about your passengers. Do you have any favourites?<p class="message sent">Oh, there are so many! But there was this one time, a lady who was a chef, offered to make me breakfast in her restaurant after I drove her to the airport.<p class=message>Wow! That's a really nice gesture. Did you take her up on the offer?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Best breakfast I've ever had.<p class=message>(laughs) Sounds like a great experience. Thanks for sharing! We're almost at my destination now.<p class="message sent">It was a pleasure driving you around, sir. Have a wonderful day in Sydney!<p class=message>Thanks again. I definitely will. Take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=77e8fd89-480e-4463-8d6b-e9236895f7f6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
