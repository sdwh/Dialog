How's the delivery going?<p class="message sent">Hey A! It's going pretty good, just delivered some delicious sushi to a customer.<p class=message>That's great! Did they seem happy with their order?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, they were really satisfied. They even gave me a big tip!<p class=message>Nice! Well, we definitely want to keep our customers happy.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, speaking of which, I think I have another order coming in.<p class=message>Okay, let's check it out. What do they want?<p class="message sent">It looks like they ordered some Korean fried chicken and a side of kimchi.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds amazing. I might have to grab some for myself later.<p class="message sent">Can't blame you, A. Our menu is really tempting.<p class=message>So true. Well, while you go deliver the food, I'll make sure everything is accounted for on our end.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. See you in a bit.<p class="message sent">Just got back from the delivery. They loved the food!<p class=message>Excellent, that's what we love to hear.<p class="message sent">And hey, I even got some exercise out of it. These deliveries are like my daily workout routine.<p class=message>Haha, I can imagine. Maybe we should add "Delivery Person" to our list of job requirements.<p class="message sent">Who knows, it might attract some fitness enthusiasts.<p class=message>Well, as long as they can deliver the food with a smile, I'm all for it.<p class="message sent">You got it, A. We'll make sure to keep the smiles and the delicious food coming.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dacd9a8f-06ed-47b5-9f4d-d18bc3c4957c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
