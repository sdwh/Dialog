How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hey A! I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great! I'm just preparing some fresh bread for the morning rush.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic! Our customers love fresh bread. Do you have anything special on the menu today?<p class=message>Yes, we're trying out a new recipe for our blueberry muffins. They're so delicious!<p class="message sent">Oh, I've got to try one. You always make the best muffins.<p class=message>Thank you, B! It's all about the secret ingredient.<p class="message sent">Are you going to share the secret with me?<p class=message>Sorry, my lips are sealed! But I'll give you a hint: it's something sweet.<p class="message sent">Well, I'll have to figure it out myself then. Speaking of sweet, how about those cinnamon rolls?<p class=message>Oh, they're one of our customer favorites. They always sell out quickly.<p class="message sent">They're just so irresistible. I have to remind myself not to eat them all!<p class=message>I know how you feel! We have to make sure we save some for our customers.<p class="message sent">Definitely. So, have you tried the new coffee blend we got in?<p class=message>No, not yet. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">It's amazing. It's a medium roast with a hint of caramel. You should definitely try it.<p class=message>I definitely will. I love trying new coffee blends.<p class="message sent">Me too. It's always exciting to find new flavors for our customers to enjoy.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's what makes our job so fun and rewarding.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, we should probably get back to work. Customers will be coming in soon.<p class=message>Right. Thanks for the chat, B!<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. Keep up the great work with those delicious pastries.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ad97a5dc-6f32-41b9-a27c-b6e15e18601d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
