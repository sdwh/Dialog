I'm a reporter from the Daily News. Can I ask you a few questions?<p class="message sent">Of course, what would you like to know?<p class=message>Well, I see you're taking part in this fun run for charity. What inspired you to sign up?<p class="message sent">I've always wanted to do something to give back to the community, and this seemed like a great way to do it while having fun!<p class=message>That's a great attitude. So, have you been training for the run?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been jogging a few times a week and trying to eat healthier to prepare.<p class=message>Good for you! Do you have any advice for first-time runners who might be nervous about participating?<p class="message sent">Just enjoy it and take it at your own pace. It's not a competition, so there's no need to stress about it.<p class=message>That's great advice. What do you think of the atmosphere here today?<p class="message sent">It's amazing! Everyone is so friendly and excited to participate. It's really motivating.<p class=message>I agree, it's wonderful to see everyone come together for a good cause. Do you have any other charity events planned in the future?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I'm definitely open to the idea. It's a great feeling to be a part of something bigger than oneself.<p class=message>Absolutely. Well, thank you so much for your time and good luck with the run!<p class="message sent">Thank you, it was my pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1030f2d5-935a-43ce-9f34-37d8aacd7985.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
