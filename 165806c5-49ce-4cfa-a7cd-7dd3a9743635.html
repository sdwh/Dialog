How's it going with the back-end development?<p class="message sent">Hey, A. It's going alright, just trying to make sure everything runs smoothly on the server-side.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've been working on the front-end design and I think it's coming along nicely.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I saw some of your designs and they look really good. Which CSS framework are you using?<p class=message>Thanks! I'm using Bootstrap, it's been really helpful for making the layout responsive and visually appealing.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. I'll have to take a closer look at it when we have some downtime. Are there any features you're having trouble implementing?<p class=message>Not exactly, but I'm trying to figure out how to make the navigation menu collapse on smaller screens. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Sure, you could use JavaScript to toggle a CSS class that hides the menu on smaller screens and shows it when clicked. I have some experience with that if you need help.<p class=message>That sounds like a good solution. Thanks, B! By the way, I heard you're a big fan of board games. What's your favorite one?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love board games! My favorite one is Settlers of Catan, have you played it before?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's a classic. I'm more of a fan of cooperative games like Pandemic, though. Have you tried that one?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've played it a few times. It's definitely challenging, but I like how everyone has to work together to save the world from disease.<p class=message>Exactly! It's a great game to play with friends or coworkers. Speaking of which, do you want to have a game night one of these days after work?<p class="message sent">Yes, that sounds like a blast! We could invite the rest of the team and make a night out of it.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Maybe we could order some pizza and drinks too.<p class="message sent">Perfect! We can celebrate our progress on the project so far.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=16566d26-92ff-44c1-9293-7e0365b9774e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
