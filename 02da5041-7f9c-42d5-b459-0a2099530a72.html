Math can be a bit tricky sometimes.<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, but I had a good teacher who explained everything clearly.<p class="message received message-content">That's important. Speaking of teachers, did you know that your dad used to be a teacher too?<p class="message sent message-content">Really? What did you teach?<p class="message received message-content">I used to teach English at a university.<p class="message sent message-content">Wow, that's cool! Can you help me with my English homework then?<p class="message received message-content">Of course, I'd be happy to. What are you working on?<p class="message sent message-content">We're learning idioms and their meanings.<p class="message received message-content">Ah, idioms can be a bit tricky. What idiom are you working on?<p class="message sent message-content">"Don't count your chickens before they're hatched."<p class="message received message-content">That's a good one. It means don't assume something will happen before it actually happens.<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, my teacher had a funny example. She said that it's like wearing an umbrella on a sunny day.<p class="message received message-content">(laughs) Your teacher sounds like a fun teacher. Well, I think you're on the right track with your homework. Keep it up!<p class="message sent message-content">Thanks, Dad!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=02d9a5c6-cdd5-4500-920c-cb489e71957c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
