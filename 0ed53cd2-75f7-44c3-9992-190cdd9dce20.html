How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm also doing well. So, let's get started. We're here to discuss the course schedule for the next few weeks. Do you have any questions or concerns?<p class="message sent">Yes, I was wondering if we could cover more examples during our lessons. I find that helps me understand the material better.<p class=message>Great point! We can definitely add more examples to our lessons to help solidify your understanding. Is there anything else that you think would be helpful?<p class="message sent">Well, I also think it would be fun to do some group exercises in class. That way, we can apply what we're learning with our peers and learn from each other.<p class=message>I like that idea too! We can definitely incorporate some group exercises in our lessons. It's always more fun to learn with others.<p class="message sent">Yes, exactly! Learning should be enjoyable and engaging.<p class=message>I completely agree. Speaking of enjoyment, have you been to any good movies or shows lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, I saw a great movie over the weekend. It was a comedy, and it had me laughing the whole time.<p class=message>That sounds like a perfect way to unwind after a week of studying. Laughter is great medicine for the soul, they say.<p class="message sent">Yes, it definitely is. Do you have any favorites that you've seen recently?<p class=message>I recently watched a documentary about space exploration. It was fascinating and eye-opening. It's amazing to think about all the discoveries that have been made so far.<p class="message sent">That sounds really interesting! I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class=message>You're welcome. It's always great to share recommendations and learn from each other. Now, let's get back to our course schedule. How does next Wednesday look for you?<p class="message sent">Wednesday works for me.<p class=message>Perfect! Looking forward to our next lesson together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0ed0a7c2-875a-4664-9740-df69d261a16b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
