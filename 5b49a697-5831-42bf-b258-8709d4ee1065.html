Just getting everything prepped for tonight's rush.<p class=message>That's fantastic. Anything new and exciting on the menu?<p class="message sent">Well, we're trying out a new marinade tonight. It's got a little bit of spice and a hint of sweetness.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds delicious! Do you think customers will like it?<p class="message sent">I sure hope so. We've had some positive feedback from our taste testers, so fingers crossed.<p class=message>Speaking of customers, have you ever had any interesting requests from them?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, all the time. One time someone asked me to make a steak blue-rare. I didn't even know that was possible!<p class=message>Haha, well that's definitely a unique request. Have you ever tried something like that yourself?<p class="message sent">Nope, I think I'll stick to medium-rare as my limit.<p class=message>Wise choice. So, do you have any secret tips for getting the perfect sear on my meat?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. One thing that helps is to make sure your meat is at room temperature before grilling. And be sure to let it rest for a few minutes after cooking.<p class=message>That makes sense. Thanks for the advice. And what about your specialty as a chef?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'd say I'm best at stir-frying. It's all about the timing and balancing the flavors.<p class=message>Well, you definitely make some amazing dishes, B. Thanks for chatting with me and good luck with the rush tonight!<p class="message sent">Thanks, A.
