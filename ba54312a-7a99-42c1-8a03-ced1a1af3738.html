Climbing on rocks requires a different approach, but it's also more fun! Have you been practicing your technique?<p class=message>Yes, I've been working on my footwork and balance. What do you recommend for climbing on these rocks?<p class="message sent">For this type of rock, it's all about finding the right handholds and foot placements. Look for cracks or small bumps where you can grip and step on.<p class=message>Ah, I see. This makes sense. What about using chalk? Do I need it?<p class="message sent">It can be helpful, especially if your palms get sweaty. But it's not essential for this level of climbing. Just focus on your technique and try to enjoy the experience.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I'm a little nervous, though.<p class="message sent">That's normal. Just remember to breathe and trust your gear. You're in good hands.<p class=message>Thanks, that's reassuring. Do you have any funny stories from your climbing experiences?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. One time I was climbing with a friend and he accidentally let go of his chalk bag, which burst open and covered us both in white powder.<p class=message>(laughs) That must have been quite a sight!<p class="message sent">Yeah, we were completely covered in chalk dust. It was a good reminder to always double-check your gear before climbing.<p class=message>(smiling) I'll make sure to do that. Thanks for sharing your story. I feel more relaxed now.<p class="message sent">Great to hear. Remember, climbing is all about having fun and challenging yourself. You got this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ba53204e-4ecb-43ad-8023-ff1ab80502ab.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
