How about yourself?<p class=message>Just great. Are you ready for the ceremony today?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I always look forward to these occasions.<p class=message>That's wonderful to hear. Is there anything specific you would like to pray for today?<p class="message sent">I just want to ask for good health and happiness for myself and my loved ones.<p class=message>Of course, that's a very important prayer. Is there anyone else you would like to add to the prayer list?<p class="message sent">Hmm, how about praying for the world leaders to make wise decisions for the benefit of all people?<p class=message>That's a great idea. We should always remember to pray for those in power.<p class="message sent">Definitely. By the way, have you heard the latest joke about the priest and the rabbi?<p class=message>No, tell me about it.<p class="message sent">The priest tells the rabbi, "I found a way we can make some extra money for the church. We just need to buy a horse and start a racing business." The rabbi responded, "But we're priests and rabbis, we can't just go into the horse racing business." The priest replied, "Don't worry about it, we'll call it Holy Horse Racing!"<p class=message>Hahaha! That's a good one. So, do you have any other funny jokes to share?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. Well, here's one. Why did the tomato turn red?<p class=message>I don't know, why?<p class="message sent">Because it saw the salad dressing!<p class=message>Ha! That's hilarious. Anyway, let's get ready for the ceremony.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'm excited for it. Thanks for chatting with me, Reverend.<p class=message>Anytime, it was my pleasure. Let's go spread some positivity today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99c1587b-19bb-40d7-8a2c-7eb5754f16ab.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
