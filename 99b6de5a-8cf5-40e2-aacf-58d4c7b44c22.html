Are you ready for the audit?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yeah, I suppose so. It's always a bit nerve-wracking having someone going through all your processes.<p class=message>I understand that, but don't worry, we'll get through it together. I'm just here to ensure everything is up to standard.<p class="message sent">I appreciate that. Is there anything specific you're looking for first?<p class=message>At the moment, I'd like to see your access control measures. How do you ensure only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data?<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. Well, we have a strict approval process for granting access and we monitor all logins and attempts to access restricted areas.<p class=message>Great to hear. How about physical security? Are your servers and equipment properly secured?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We have security cameras, access controls, and a security staff on duty 24/7.<p class=message>Excellent! Now, let's talk about information security awareness. Have you conducted any training for your staff on how to properly handle sensitive data?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have regular training sessions and reminders to ensure everyone is aware of their responsibilities when handling confidential data.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear. It's important for everyone to understand the gravity of their actions when it comes to information security.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We take our data protection responsibilities seriously and want to make sure we're doing everything we can to prevent any breaches.<p class=message>It sounds like you're doing a great job so far. Let's continue with the audit and see where we're at.<p class="message sent">Thanks! I feel confident with our processes in place, but it's always good to have someone double-check.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99b659c2-3094-4015-aaf6-097a4a64c470.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
