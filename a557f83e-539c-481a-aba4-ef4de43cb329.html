How's the design for the new company website coming along?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It's going well so far. I think we should go for a modern and sleek look for the website.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea! I was thinking of using some animations and interactive elements to make it more dynamic.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And we should definitely make sure that it's mobile-friendly since most people browse the web on their phones these days.<p class=message>Good point. How about we add some bright colors to the design to make it pop?<p class="message sent">As long as they complement the brand colors, I'm all for it! And we should make sure the website is easy to navigate too.<p class=message>Absolutely. Oh, and we should also add a blog section to help improve the website's search engine optimization.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's a great idea! We could also include some video testimonials from satisfied customers to add a personal touch.<p class=message>I like that idea, B. I think it would really make the website stand out. What about using big bold fonts for headings and titles?<p class="message sent">That's perfect! Bold fonts will help the content stand out and grab the reader's attention.<p class=message>One more thing, what about using some custom illustrations and graphics to make the website look unique?<p class="message sent">Yes! Custom illustrations would definitely make the website look more engaging and dynamic.<p class=message>Awesome! I think we have a solid plan for the website now. Let's put everything together and see how it looks.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, A! I can't wait to see the finished product.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a550fc0c-cdbe-4d64-8de0-735ab172e9b0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
