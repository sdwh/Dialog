Can you believe it's been 5 years since we got married?<p class="message sent message-content">I know, it feels like just yesterday we were exchanging our vows.<p class="message received message-content">Remember how nervous I was when I read my vows? I almost stumbled over my words.<p class="message sent message-content">Don't worry, you still looked handsome and it still made me cry.<p class="message received message-content">Well, that's a relief to hear. So, what do you want to order for dinner?<p class="message sent message-content">I don't know, this menu has so many options. What are you thinking of getting?<p class="message received message-content">Maybe the steak or the seafood pasta. But first, I think we should toast to our happy marriage.<p class="message sent message-content">Agreed, cheers to us for surviving 5 years of marriage!<p class="message received message-content">Haha, surviving indeed. You know what they say, "Behind every successful man is a surprised woman."<p class="message sent message-content">And behind every successful woman is a supportive, loving husband.<p class="message received message-content">Aw, you always know how to make me feel special. I'm so lucky to have you.<p class="message sent message-content">And I'm lucky to have you too. Happy anniversary, my dear.
