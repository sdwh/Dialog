I'm interested in buying a new suit for an upcoming wedding. Can you help me find something that fits well?<p class="message sent">Certainly sir, what kind of suit are you looking for?<p class=message>Something classic, yet comfortable. I don't want to feel like I'm wearing a straitjacket all night!<p class="message sent">I understand. How about this one? It's made of a lightweight fabric and has a modern fit.<p class=message>Hmm, let me try it on. (A goes into the changing room and comes out a few minutes later.) Wow, this does feel comfortable! I like it!<p class="message sent">Great to hear that. Maybe you can try a different color too.<p class=message>Yeah, I was thinking of that too. How about this navy blue one?<p class="message sent">That looks great on you! It compliments your skin tone very nicely.<p class=message>(laughs) Thanks! I never thought about that before.<p class="message sent">No problem! That's what I'm here for.<p class=message>I do have one more question though. Can it go well with brown shoes?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Navy blue goes well with brown shoes. It's a classic combination.<p class=message>Awesome! I think I'll take both of them then. Thanks for your help!<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Don't forget to check out our tie section before you leave!<p class=message>Of course! I forgot about that. Maybe you can help me pick one out too?<p class="message sent">Consider it done! You're going to look great at that wedding.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8130e1f1-b6f9-432b-a455-0e90007bc682.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
