B, would you like to go first?<p class="message sent">Sure, thanks. Yesterday, I added a new feature to the app that allows users to customize their profile pictures. It was a fun challenge to implement.<p class=message>That sounds great, what feedback have we received so far from our users?<p class="message sent">The feedback has been positive, they like the personalization feature. We've had over 50 user requests for different profile pictures already.<p class=message>Awesome, keep up the good work! I also wanted to let everyone know that the marketing team had an interesting idea for a new ad campaign. They want to feature a cute puppy using our app. Thoughts?<p class="message sent">I'm all for it! Who doesn't love puppies? But what kind of dog are we talking about here?<p class=message>Maybe a golden retriever? They're usually pretty friendly and photogenic.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, but as long as we don't get any complaints from animal rights activists, we're good to go!<p class=message>Haha, yeah let's hope not. Alright, any other updates or concerns to discuss?<p class="message sent">Actually, I noticed a bug in the messaging feature. Some users are experiencing a delay in messages being sent.<p class=message>Oh no, thanks for letting us know. Can you look into it and get back to us with a solution?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'll make it a priority. Thanks for listening.<p class=message>Thanks to all of you for your updates. Let's keep up the good work and make our app even better for our users.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=084d6ea5-5fd0-462d-a205-df6aa3dfafce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
