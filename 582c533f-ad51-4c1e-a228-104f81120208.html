Are you doing all the work or is your mom helping you?<p class="message sent">We're working together. Mom is teaching me how to measure ingredients and mix them properly.<p class=message>That's great. It's always nice to spend quality time with family.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm enjoying this a lot. And we get to enjoy the cake after we're done!<p class=message>Definitely, homemade desserts always taste better. Have you baked before?<p class="message sent">A little bit, but this is the first time I'm doing it with my mom. We're having a blast.<p class=message>I can tell, you both look so focused and happy. Keep up the good work.<p class="message sent">Thanks, it's the perfect activity for a lazy weekend afternoon.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Do you need any help with anything?<p class="message sent">Actually, can you help us open this jar of chocolate chips? We're struggling a bit.<p class=message>No problem, let me give it a try. *opens the jar* There you go, teamwork makes the dream work.<p class="message sent">Haha, thanks! We couldn't have done it without you.<p class=message>Anytime. Now let's get back to making this cake. I can't wait to try it.<p class="message sent">Me too! Thanks for joining us, it's been fun.<p class=message>Thank you for inviting me. I love spending time with you and your mom.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=582befe8-0b9b-4246-a11a-96188a34b146.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
