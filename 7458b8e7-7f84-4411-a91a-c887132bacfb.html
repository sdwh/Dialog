What's that?<p class=message>It's a traditional dish from Costa Rica made with rice and black beans.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Is it spicy?<p class=message>Not really. It's usually mildly seasoned with onions, garlic, and cilantro.<p class="message sent">I'm curious now. What else goes into it?<p class=message>Some versions include diced bell pepper, tomato sauce, and sometimes even a splash of Lizano sauce for an extra kick.<p class="message sent">Lizano sauce? I've never heard of that one.<p class=message>Oh, it's a Costa Rican sauce that's similar to Worcestershire, but with a uniquely sweet and tangy taste.<p class="message sent">I might have to look for that sauce. Is Gallo Pinto usually served with anything else?<p class=message>Yes, it's often paired with scrambled eggs, fried plantains, and sour cream.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a hearty breakfast.<p class=message>You got that right. It's a staple dish for Ticos, and even Costa Ricans who live abroad crave for it from time to time.<p class="message sent">I can see why. It sounds delicious.<p class=message>Absolutely. In fact, some people say that Gallo Pinto unites the Costa Rican culture more than anything else.<p class="message sent">That's amazing! I think I need to try it ASAP.<p class=message>I'll make sure to invite you over for some Gallo Pinto soon. Deal?<p class="message sent">Deal! And maybe we can even try to make it together. What do you say?<p class=message>That would be awesome! Let's plan for it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=745454bf-8b46-4c65-8a8e-b4aa7e437bf8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
