How do you like the room so far?<p class="message sent">Hi A, it's looking great! I really love the color scheme you've chosen.<p class=message>I'm so glad to hear that. So I have a few different design concepts I've been working on, do you have a preference?<p class="message sent">Hmm, they all look really good. But I'm leaning towards the more modern design approach.<p class=message>Perfect, that's actually my favorite too. So let's talk about some specific details. What do you think about incorporating some fun lighting fixtures?<p class="message sent">I love that idea! Maybe even something funky like neon lights?<p class=message>Yes, absolutely! And we could also add some bold patterns to the upholstery to really make it pop.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! I'm very excited to see the end product.<p class=message>Me too, it's going to be amazing. And don't worry, I'll be sure to keep the budget in mind while we work on this.<p class="message sent">Thank you, I really appreciate that. I have a feeling this design is going to impress all of our guests.<p class=message>Yes! And who knows, maybe it'll even make some headlines in the design world.<p class="message sent">Haha, wouldn't that be amazing! Alright, let's get started on this project.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4995073d-68c4-4005-9790-673331327c4d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
