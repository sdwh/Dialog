I'm a vegetarian and I'm looking for some delicious vegetarian dishes to try. Can you recommend any dishes on the menu?<p class="message sent">Welcome! Yes, we have a variety of vegetarian options available. Our most popular dishes are the Buddha's Delight and Mapo Tofu, both of which are vegan friendly.<p class=message>Both sound great! I think I'll try the Buddha's Delight. Could you also tell me more about the ingredients in it?<p class="message sent">The Buddha's Delight typically includes a mix of vegetables such as mushrooms, tofu, bok choy, bamboo shoots, and carrots. We also season it with a light soy sauce and sesame oil for added flavor.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. And do you have any vegan dessert options?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a dairy-free tofu pudding topped with sweet syrup and fresh fruit. It's a great way to end your meal on a sweet note.<p class=message>Yum, I'll definitely try that! Do you have any other vegetarian recommendations?<p class="message sent">You might also enjoy our braised eggplant with garlic, or our stir-fried mushrooms with ginger and scallions. Both dishes are full of flavor and great for veggie lovers.<p class=message>Those sound delicious too! I'll have to come back and try those next time. Thanks for your recommendations, I'm looking forward to trying the Buddha's Delight and tofu pudding.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Enjoy your meal and let me know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=761b69ad-7f9b-412e-8ebd-91aaf6a39a0f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
