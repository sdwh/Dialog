Are you excited to explore this iconic landmark?<p class="message sent">Yes, absolutely! I’ve seen so many pictures of it and now I’m finally here. It's breathtaking!<p class=message>That's great to hear. The Opera House is one of Australia’s most recognizable buildings, and it’s the perfect spot for taking photos of Sydney. Did you know that it took 14 years and over 10,000 workers to build it?<p class="message sent">Wow, 14 years is a really long time! Do you have any interesting stories about the opera house?<p class=message>Of course! One interesting fact is that the architect Jørn Utzon was actually fired halfway through the building process. However, his vision was later completed and he was awarded the Pritzker Prize, which is also known as the Nobel Prize of architecture.<p class="message sent">That's incredible! The architecture is really unique, but is there anything else that sets it apart from other opera houses?<p class=message>Yes, unlike most opera houses, the Sydney Opera House was designed to be a multi-purpose venue. It has a variety of concert halls and theaters that host not only opera, but also theater performances, ballets, and even rock concerts.<p class="message sent">That's amazing! I would definitely love to attend a concert here one day. Are there any tips you can suggest for tourists who want to visit the Opera House?<p class=message>Sure, I recommend taking a guided tour to learn more about the history of this place, and to get a closer look at the interior designs of the theaters. Also, don't forget to take a stroll around the harbor to get a stunning view of the city.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your helpful tips and all the fascinating stories you’ve shared with us. I'll be sure to take many photos and remember my visit to the Opera House!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e0c86994-5a1e-4c36-a0de-50faaf7ecec2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
