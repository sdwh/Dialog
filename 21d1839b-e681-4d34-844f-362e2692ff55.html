I'll have a cappuccino and one of those delicious-looking pastries.<p class=message>Excellent choice! We have a wide variety of pastries, which one catches your eye?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that custard-filled one looks amazing. What's it called?<p class=message>That one is our famous éclair, piped with vanilla pastry cream and topped with chocolate ganache.<p class="message sent">Wow, sounds too good to resist! How about you, which one is your favorite, A?<p class=message>Well, it's hard to choose just one, but I would have to say the lemon tart. It's tangy, sweet and oh so addictive.<p class="message sent">You're making me hungry now! So what's the secret behind your perfect croissants?<p class=message>Ah, that's top secret! But I can tell you that we use high-quality butter and allow the dough to proof to perfection.<p class="message sent">I see, I'll have to come here more often to taste all of your specialties.<p class=message>That would be fantastic! You know, we also offer baking classes. You could develop your pastry skills and maybe even become a pastry chef one day.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! Thank you for bringing it up, I would love to join one of your classes.<p class=message>My pleasure! We have a lot of fun, and you'll learn how to create amazing pastries just like ours.<p class="message sent">I can't wait! And here's my cappuccino and éclair, it looks too pretty to eat!<p class=message>Enjoy! Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. You're such a helpful and cheerful assistant.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=21cc36f3-ba82-4b69-9bc7-de4d9e711424.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
