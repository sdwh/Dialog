How's your day going?<p class="message sent message-content">Hey, A. It's going well. How about you?<p class="message received message-content">Can't complain. Say, I've been tasked with testing a new e-commerce site. Any advice?<p class="message sent message-content">Sure, what's the tech stack?<p class="message received message-content">Mostly Angular on the front-end and .NET Core on the back-end.<p class="message sent message-content">Great, have you considered using Cypress for testing?<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, I've heard good things about it. What makes it better than other testing frameworks?<p class="message sent message-content">Well, it allows you to test end-to-end in a way that's both easy and reliable. Plus, it has a great user interface.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds ideal. I'll check it out. Hey, did I tell you about the time I accidentally broke a production server?<p class="message sent message-content">No, but now I'm all ears.<p class="message received message-content">Long story short, I was copying some files and accidentally deleted the wrong folder. Next thing I know, all I can see is green text...<p class="message sent message-content">Yikes. What was the aftermath?<p class="message received message-content">Let's just say I was on call for the next week. How's your project going?<p class="message sent message-content">It's going well. I'm trying out this new CSS technique where you use grid to make responsive layouts easier.<p class="message received message-content">Grid?<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, it's this new feature in CSS that lets you create flexible layouts without having to mess with floats or positioning.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds intriguing. Maybe I'll give it a shot. Anyway, thanks for the advice on testing. I'm excited to try out Cypress.<p class="message sent message-content">No problem, happy to help. Let me know how it goes!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0249f0f0-01b9-467c-af76-b32ae21025aa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
