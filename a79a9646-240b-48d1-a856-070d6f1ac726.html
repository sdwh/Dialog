How's everything going with your research project?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Professor. It's going well so far, but I could use some advice.<p class=message>Of course, I'm happy to help. What's on your mind?<p class="message sent">I'm trying to think of a fun and creative way to present my findings. Do you have any suggestions?<p class=message>Have you thought about creating a video or an infographic? Those can be really engaging for audiences.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I'll explore those options. Also, I'm not sure if my research question is specific enough. Any thoughts?<p class=message>Hmm, well specificity is key. What's the main focus of your project?<p class="message sent">I'm studying the impact of social media on mental health.<p class=message>Ah, okay. Maybe you could narrow it down to a specific platform or demographic.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. I'll work on that. By the way, have you heard about the new caf√© across the street? It's supposed to be amazing.<p class=message>I have! I've been meaning to try it out. Maybe we could grab some coffee there later and continue discussing your project.<p class="message sent">That sounds great, Professor. Thanks for your help and also for the coffee offer.<p class=message>No problem, B. I'm always happy to chat about research and to discover new coffee spots. See you later!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a789282b-515f-4687-ae71-61f5e72aaca1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
