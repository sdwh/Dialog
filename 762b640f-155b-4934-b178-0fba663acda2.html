What can I help you with?<p class=message>Well, I've been tasked with developing a trusted blockchain application system. Where do I start?<p class="message sent">Great question! First, let's talk about which blockchain platform you're planning to use.<p class=message>I was thinking about using Ethereum. What are your thoughts?<p class="message sent">Ethereum is definitely a popular choice in the blockchain community. Its virtual machine allows developers to write smart contracts.<p class=message>Yeah, that's exactly what I'm looking for. I want to ensure that our application can carry out transactions securely and efficiently.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Have you thought about incorporating any decentralized identity protocols?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Can you explain more about that?<p class="message sent">A decentralized identity protocol helps ensure the authenticity of a transaction by verifying the identity of the parties involved. This can be used to reduce the risk of fraud.<p class=message>That's a great idea. How would you suggest we incorporate this into our application?<p class="message sent">I recommend using a public key infrastructure, which is a type of decentralized identity protocol that uses digital certificates to verify the identity of the parties involved.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. What kind of data should we be storing on the blockchain?<p class="message sent">Typically, you would store data related to the transactions, as well as any metadata associated with those transactions.<p class=message>Got it. One last question, how would you suggest we handle scalability?<p class="message sent">Scalability is a common challenge in blockchain development. We can consider sharding, which involves splitting the data into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be processed in parallel.<p class=message>That's a good suggestion. Thanks for all your help, B. I have a better understanding of how we can develop a trusted blockchain application system now.<p class="message sent">Glad to help, A. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7621effa-e4af-4467-991d-d8c6568afefc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
