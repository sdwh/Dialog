What did we get?<p class=message>We've got some huge tiger prawns, jumbo clams, and a bunch of different types of fish, including some really nice pomfret and sea bass.<p class="message sent">Wow, those sound amazing. Let's feature them on the specials menu tonight.<p class=message>Great idea, boss. How about we make a seafood hotpot with those ingredients? It's cold out and I think our customers would love something warming.<p class="message sent">Perfect, and let's also include some stir-fried spicy clams as an appetizer.<p class=message>Sounds good, boss. I'll get started on the prep. Do you want to taste-test the dishes before we finalize the recipe?<p class="message sent">Of course, I wouldn't miss that for the world. The tastings are one of the best parts of being a restaurant owner.<p class=message>Haha, you're not wrong there. Speaking of tasting, have you tried that new Szechuan pepper oil I ordered? It's super spicy but incredibly flavorful.<p class="message sent">I haven't yet, but I'm excited to give it a try. Maybe we can add a dash of it to the hotpot to give it some extra kick.<p class=message>Perfect, and don't worry, I'll make sure it's not too overpowering. I don't want to burn our customers' tongues off.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's very considerate of you. Whatever you do, just make sure it's delicious. Our customers have high expectations.<p class=message>No problem, boss. You know me, I won't let you down. Let's get cooking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d7b98d50-a3ea-46b1-afc0-f8afd63c62f7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
