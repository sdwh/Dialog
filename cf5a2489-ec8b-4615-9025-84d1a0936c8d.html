I heard that you've been doing some penetration testing on our system. Did you find anything interesting?<p class="message sent">Hey, yeah! I actually found a vulnerability in the login authentication that could potentially allow unauthorized access.<p class=message>Oh no! That sounds serious. Have you reported it to the security team yet?<p class="message sent">Of course! They've already started working on a fix for it. In the meantime, I've disabled the affected feature just to be safe.<p class=message>Good call. It's always better to err on the side of caution. By the way, how did you even find that vulnerability? Do you use any special tools?<p class="message sent">Well, I do use some automated testing tools, but I also like to manually test the system by trying out different inputs and seeing how it responds.<p class=message>That's pretty cool. It's great to have someone on the team who knows their way around security testing. Do you have any tips on how I can learn more about it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I can recommend some online courses and tutorials that helped me get started. I think it's a really interesting field, and there's always something new to learn.<p class=message>Awesome, thanks! Hey, speaking of learning, have you tried any new coding languages or frameworks lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, I recently started learning Rust. It's a really interesting language that's designed to be fast and secure by default. I'm excited to see where I can use it in our codebase.<p class=message>Wow, I'm impressed! I've heard of Rust, but I haven't had a chance to try it out myself. Maybe you can give me a demo sometime.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! I'd be happy to show you the basics. It's always great to share knowledge and skills with others on the team.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. And who knows, maybe I'll be the one finding the security vulnerabilities next time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cf4f2974-4ab6-4f1d-bb44-f783848abbd1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
