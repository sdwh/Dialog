Our standard rooms come with a king-sized bed, a luxurious bathroom, and all the amenities you could need.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. And do you have any recommendations for things to do in the area?<p class="message sent">Of course! We have a charming downtown area with lots of shops, restaurants, and galleries. And if you're feeling adventurous, there are plenty of hiking trails and scenic vistas to explore.<p class=message>Sounds like there's plenty to do. And what about dining options? Do you have a restaurant on-site?<p class="message sent">Yes, we do! Our restaurant serves delicious, locally-sourced cuisine that's bound to impress. And if you're looking for something quick and casual, we also have a cafe and a bar.<p class=message>Great to hear. One last thing - what's the check-in time?<p class="message sent">Standard check-in is at 3pm, but if you need to arrive earlier or later than that, just let us know and we'll do our best to accommodate you.<p class=message>That's very helpful, thank you.
