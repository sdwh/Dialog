Australia has a lot of beautiful and interesting places to visit.<p class=message>Absolutely! I've been reading about the iconic places like the Great Barrier Reef and Uluru. Have you been to any of them?<p class="message sent">I haven't, but they're definitely on my bucket list. My favorite historical site in Australia is the Port Arthur Historic Site in Tasmania.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. Could you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Sure! It used to be a notorious convict penal settlement, which is now a popular tourist attraction. It's a great way to learn about Australia's colonial history.<p class=message>That's really cool! Speaking of convicts, have you heard of the Old Melbourne Gaol?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! It's known as the place where Australia's most infamous outlaw, Ned Kelly, was executed.<p class=message>That's right! And did you know that you can take a night tour of the gaol that's supposed to be pretty spooky?<p class="message sent">Oh, I love spooky stuff! I'll have to check that out.<p class=message>Another interesting place to visit is the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne. It's considered one of the oldest remaining exhibition pavilions in the world.<p class="message sent">Wow, I had no idea about that. I'll make sure to add it to my list.<p class=message>If you're interested in natural wonders, you should definitely visit the Daintree Rainforest in Far North Queensland. It's one of the oldest rainforests in the world.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! I love nature and I'll make sure to visit it someday.<p class=message>Another beautiful site is Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory. It's famous for its stunning waterfalls and rock formations.<p class="message sent">That sounds breathtaking. I can't wait to explore all these beautiful places and learn more about Australia's rich cultural history.<p class=message>Same here!
