That's great!<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. I've heard it's a powerful framework and I want to learn more about it.<p class=message>Definitely. First, I suggest getting familiar with C# programming language basics, as it's the language used in ASP.NET Core.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll start there. Would you recommend any resources for that?<p class=message>There are a lot of great online courses like Pluralsight and Udemy. You can also check out Microsoft's official C# documentation.<p class="message sent">Cool, thanks for the tips. What's next after that?<p class=message>Once you have a solid foundation in C#, you can start learning about the ASP.NET Core framework itself. I recommend starting with Microsoft's official documentation again. It's really comprehensive and easy to follow.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. I'll check it out. Do you have any advice for hands-on learning?<p class=message>Absolutely, the best way to learn is by doing. You can start with simple projects, like creating a basic blog, and gradually increase the complexity as you get more comfortable with ASP.NET Core.<p class="message sent">I like that idea. How about joining online communities?<p class=message>Yes, that's a great idea too. You can join forums like Stack Overflow or subreddits like /r/ASPNET to ask questions and learn from others who are also working with the framework.<p class="message sent">Awesome, I'll definitely keep that in mind. Do you have experience working with ASP.NET Core?<p class=message>Yes, I've been developing with it for a few years now. It's a really powerful framework and has a lot of great features that make development easier and more efficient.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Thanks for all the tips, A. I'm excited to dive in and start learning ASP.NET Core!<p class=message>No problem, B. Good luck and have fun with it!
