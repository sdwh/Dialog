My name is Chef A.<p class="message sent">Hi, Chef A. I'm the photographer for this project. Nice to meet you.<p class=message>Nice to meet you too. So, are you ready to learn how to make some delicious and traditional wagashi?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm excited to see the process and try some of the finished products.<p class=message>Great! First, we'll start by making the mochi. It's a sticky rice dough that we'll use as the base for some of the wagashi.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a challenge, but I'm up for it.<p class=message>Don't worry, I'll guide you through it. Next, we'll make the anko, which is a sweet red bean paste filling.<p class="message sent">Yum, I've tasted that before and loved it.<p class=message>Yes, it's a common ingredient in wagashi. We'll also use matcha powder, sesame seeds, and other ingredients to add flavor and texture.<p class="message sent">This is so interesting, Chef A. How did you become a wagashi maker?<p class=message>I've been making wagashi since I was a teenager. It's a part of my family's tradition passed down from my grandmother.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. It must be an honor to carry on that tradition.<p class=message>It definitely is. And now, I'm happy to share this tradition with you.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Chef A. I'm excited to take some photos and show off your beautiful wagashi creations.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. Let's get started!<p class="message sent">Wow, I can't believe how intricate and beautiful these wagashi are.<p class=message>Yes, wagashi making requires a lot of time and patience, but the end result is always worth it.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I think everyone should try wagashi at least once in their life.<p class=message>I agree. It's not only delicious, but it's also a great way to appreciate Japanese culture and tradition.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for teaching me today, Chef A. It was an unforgettable experience.<p class=message>No problem at all, B. It was great working with you. And don't forget to take some wagashi home with you!<p class="message sent">I absolutely will. Thanks again!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8cb13d9c-a575-4f6c-9b7b-85210375b247.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
