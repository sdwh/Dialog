Can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a game where players have to solve a series of increasingly challenging puzzles to progress through different levels.<p class=message>Sounds interesting. What kind of puzzles are involved?<p class="message sent">There are a mix of logic puzzles, spatial puzzles, and even some word puzzles thrown in.<p class=message>Ah, I see. That sounds like it'll really test players' brains.<p class="message sent">Exactly. I wanted to create a game that really challenges people to think outside the box.<p class=message>So, how long do you anticipate the game being?<p class="message sent">There are planned to be 100 levels in total. I'm hoping it'll keep players entertained for quite a while.<p class=message>Wow, that's a lot of content. How long did it take you to develop the game?<p class="message sent">It's taken me about a year to get to this point. But I'm really excited with how it's turning out.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Have you tried playing through it yourself?<p class="message sent">Of course! I've had to test it extensively to make sure it's balanced and fair. But even I find some of the later puzzles challenging.<p class=message>Well, I can't wait to give it a try. When do you think it'll be released?<p class="message sent">We're aiming for a release in the next few months. I'll let you know as soon as it's available.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I'm sure it'll be a hit.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I appreciate the support. It's been a labor of love, but I think it'll be worth it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f43dbfc5-cc0c-4149-a151-fa4a2ad3131a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
