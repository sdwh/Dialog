I’m excited to see what you’ve come up with.<p class=message>Great! Well, it’s a comedy about a time-traveling pizza delivery guy who gets caught up in a love triangle.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. How have you managed to incorporate time travel into a pizza delivery story?<p class=message>Well, I’ve invented this special pizza oven that acts as a time machine. The delivery guy accidentally gets sent back to the 1950s and has to navigate a completely different world.<p class="message sent">Wow, that’s creative. Do you feel like you’ve captured the humor well?<p class=message>I hope so! I’ve had a few early readers who found it really funny.<p class="message sent">Excellent. Are there any areas where you’re struggling or need help with development?<p class=message>Actually, I’m having a bit of trouble with the love triangle aspect. I don’t want it to come across as cliche or contrived.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that can be tricky. Have you thought about subverting expectations in some way?<p class=message>That’s a good point. Maybe I’ll have the pizza guy fall in love with a woman who’s actually from the future and also gets stuck in the past.<p class="message sent">I like it! That could definitely add a fresh twist to the classic love triangle trope.<p class=message>Cool, thanks for the encouragement. I’m feeling more confident about this now.<p class="message sent">Of course. Let’s keep working on it together and make this manuscript the best it can be.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Speaking of plans, have you had lunch yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, since we’re talking about pizza, I thought maybe we could order some for a working lunch.<p class="message sent">Now that’s an offer I can’t refuse! Let’s do it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=344202a6-c749-47a4-8c36-bd4570a3f068.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
