So tell me, what inspired you to open this new restaurant?<p class="message sent">Well, I've always loved cooking and experimenting with different flavors. After years of working in the industry, I decided it was time to open my own place.<p class=message>That's fantastic!

So what are some must-try dishes on your menu?<p class="message sent">Our signature dish is the "Korean BBQ tacos" - a fusion of Korean and Mexican flavors. We also have a "Curry Chicken Pot Pie" which is a unique twist on a classic dish.<p class=message>Yum, my mouth is watering just hearing about it. Are there any vegetarian or vegan options on the menu?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a few vegetarian and vegan options such as our "Mediterranean Bowl" and "Portobello Mushroom Burger".<p class=message>Wow, it sounds like there's something for everyone. How has the response been from customers so far?<p class="message sent">We've had a great response so far. People love the unique flavors and the welcoming atmosphere of the restaurant.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So what's next for your restaurant?<p class="message sent">We're constantly innovating and experimenting with new dishes. We also plan on expanding our catering services in the near future.<p class=message>Well, I wish you all the best with that.
