Can I help you with something?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. I'm a chef from the airline and I need some help selecting the menu for our next flight.<p class=message>Of course! What kind of cuisine are you looking for? We have burgers, pizzas, noodles, sushi, and more.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I was thinking of doing something different this time. Maybe some Mexican food or Mediterranean dishes?<p class=message>Great choices! For Mexican, we have tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas. And for Mediterranean, we have falafel, hummus, shawarma, and tabbouleh.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious! I think I'll add some tacos and falafel to the menu. Do you have any vegetarian options as well?<p class=message>Definitely! Our vegetarian options include veggie burgers, salads, tofu stir-fry, and vegetarian sushi rolls.<p class="message sent">Perfect! I'll definitely add some of those options as well. By the way, how do you usually serve the food on the plane?<p class=message>We usually serve the meals on trays with disposable cutlery and cups. We also provide some condiments and napkins for convenience.<p class="message sent">Got it. That sounds good. Do you have any recommendations for which drinks to offer alongside the meals?<p class=message>Our most popular drinks on the plane are water, soda, and juice. We also offer a selection of hot beverages like coffee and tea.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great selection. How about desserts?<p class=message>We have a variety of desserts, including cheesecake, chocolate cake, tiramisu, and fruit cups.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm torn between the chocolate cake and the fruit cups. Which one do you think is more popular?<p class=message>Both are quite popular, but the fruit cups are a healthier option that appeals to many passengers.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's go with the fruit cups then. Thank you so much for your help.<p class=message>You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you. We look forward to serving your delicious meals on our flights.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4e26a0e2-d8b1-481a-9ac5-83382c6b3ab7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
