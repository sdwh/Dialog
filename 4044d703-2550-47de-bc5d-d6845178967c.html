It's nice to meet you. So, we're both here to discuss the electronic health record system, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. Our hospital wants to be more efficient and we think an EHR system can help us do that.<p class=message>Definitely. And since I'm a network engineer, I can help make sure the system is secure and scalable.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. As a sysadmin, I can help ensure that the system runs smoothly and that the servers are properly managed.<p class=message>Perfect! So, what specific features would you like to see in the EHR system?<p class="message sent">Well, we need it to be able to securely store patient records and also have a search function that allows us to quickly find the information we need.<p class=message>Right, and we'll need to be able to integrate different types of data, like lab results and imaging scans. Do we have any specific software or platform in mind?<p class="message sent">Our hospital is currently using a cloud-based platform, but we're open to exploring other options if needed.<p class=message>I see. Well, I think we'll need to do a thorough analysis of the hospital's needs and resources before we can make any decisions.<p class="message sent">Agreed. We also need to make sure the system complies with all relevant regulations and standards.<p class=message>Absolutely. Well, I'm looking forward to working with you on this project, B.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. It's great to have a team with expertise in both networking and systems administration.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=403fd20b-a05b-4408-96a7-4ae36af80939.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
