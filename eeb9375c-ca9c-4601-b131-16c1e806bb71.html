It's quite alarming, don't you think?<p class=message>Definitely. It's a good thing that we have the coast guard to respond to such incidents.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's important to be well-prepared in case something like that happens when we're out at sea.<p class=message>That's true. What kind of equipment do you think we should have on board in case of an emergency?<p class="message sent">Well, we should have life jackets, life rafts, flares, and radios to call for help.<p class=message>Good point. And we should also make sure that everyone on board knows how to use them.<p class="message sent">Exactly. It's not just having the equipment, but also knowing how to use it effectively.<p class=message>Do you think we should also have a backup plan in case the equipment fails?<p class="message sent">Of course. We should always have a contingency plan in place. That way, we're well-prepared for any unexpected situations.<p class=message>I agree. It's always better to be prepared and not need it, than to need it and not be prepared.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Let's make sure we review our emergency procedures before our next voyage.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Safety first, always!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eeb8fefb-3e86-4e95-95e3-ba117f4ee4c6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
