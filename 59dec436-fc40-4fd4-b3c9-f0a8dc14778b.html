You know, I think you have something in common with my cat.<p class="message sent">Really? What's that?<p class=message>Both of you seem to enjoy taking long naps during the day.<p class="message sent">(laughs) I guess you're right, maybe I should get a nice cozy bed like your cat.<p class=message>Ha! Maybe we can find you one made out of hospital bedsheets.<p class="message sent">That sounds comfortable, but I'm looking forward to going home and sleeping in my own bed.<p class=message>I understand completely. Have you thought about what you'll have for breakfast today?<p class="message sent">Not really. What do you suggest?<p class=message>How about some oatmeal? It's a healthy choice and may be easier on your stomach.<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds good. And what about lunch?<p class=message>Let's aim for something with protein, like a chicken sandwich or salad.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Thank you for taking such good care of me.<p class=message>It's my pleasure! I'm glad you're on the road to recovery.<p class="message sent">Me too. By the way, did you hear about the doctor who swallowed a thermometer?<p class=message>No, I haven't! What happened?<p class="message sent">He said he had a fever, but he just couldn't keep his own temperature!<p class=message>(laughs) That's a good one! You should become a comedian!<p class="message sent">Maybe I will once I'm out of here. Thanks for brightening my day.<p class=message>Anytime! I'll check on you later to see how you're doing.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=59d7e427-2166-48c6-8fb5-3f13f1fcfc7b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
