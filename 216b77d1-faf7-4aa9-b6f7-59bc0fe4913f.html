I heard the source code check for our software didn’t go as planned.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we found a few vulnerabilities, but nothing we can’t fix with a little bit of work.<p class=message>That’s good to hear. What did you find?<p class="message sent">Well, it seems we need to patch up some SQL injection points in our code. It’s a pretty common issue.<p class=message>Yeah, I’m familiar with that. Plus, we need to make sure we’re not vulnerable to cross-site scripting.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It’s important to stay on top of those kinds of things. Luckily, we caught them now instead of dealing with them later.<p class=message>Agreed. So, what steps are we taking to ensure we’re safe from these kinds of attacks?<p class="message sent">We’re planning to implement input validation and sanitize user input as well as implement escape characters to protect against potential future attacks.<p class=message>Great. It sounds like we’re making some solid changes to improve our software’s security.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We take security very seriously around here, and we want to make sure our users are as safe as possible.<p class=message>That’s a great attitude to have. It’s reassuring for users to know that we put their protection first.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Plus, it’s always fun to dive into the code and find ways to make it better.<p class=message>Ha! I can see you enjoy the challenge. Well, I’m glad we have you on the team.<p class="message sent">Thanks! It’s always a pleasure working with someone who appreciates the importance of security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2169b273-a9c4-402e-9769-a1159ec35321.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
