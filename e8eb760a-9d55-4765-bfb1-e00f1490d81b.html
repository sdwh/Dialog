What's the story behind it, A?<p class=message>Legend has it that it was actually introduced to Italy by Marco Polo when he returned from China.<p class="message sent">That's fascinating! Speaking of spaghetti, I made a really good pasta sauce this morning. Want to try it out?<p class=message>Absolutely! Let's give it a taste. Hmm...this is really good, B. What's in it?<p class="message sent">Just some garlic, onions, canned tomatoes, and a pinch of oregano. Simple but flavorful.<p class=message>I agree, it's not always about the number of ingredients used, but how they come together to create harmony. By the way, did you hear about the new restaurant down the street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's special about it?<p class=message>They serve all-day breakfast dishes. I tried their pancakes and they were fluffy and delicious.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. I love breakfast food any time of the day. We should check it out after work.<p class=message>Count me in. Speaking of work, we need to get back to the kitchen and finish up the orders.<p class="message sent">Right, let's get cooking. I hear we have some hungry customers waiting for our food.<p class=message>No time to waste then. Let's hustle!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e8eb10cc-8a60-4b13-8669-430823ca1219.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
