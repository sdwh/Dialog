What do you want to know about it?<p class="message received message-content">I was wondering how it could help us in our work. Have you found any benefits from using it?<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely. It helps us to identify and classify our data and resources in a more structured way.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds useful. I've always been a bit confused about how to properly classify things.<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, me too. But with ISO 27001, it's all laid out clearly and it helps us to keep our data safe and secure.<p class="message received message-content">Okay, so what's the process for implementing it in our company?<p class="message sent message-content">There's a lot involved, but basically we need to assess our current information assets, classify them based on their sensitivity, and then implement proper security measures for each level of classification.<p class="message received message-content">Got it. I'll have a closer look at the guidelines and start thinking about how we can apply it to our work.<p class="message sent message-content">Great idea. It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to protecting our data.<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely. And it's not just about protecting our company's information, but also our clients' information too.<p class="message sent message-content">That's right. We have a responsibility to keep everything secure and confidential.<p class="message received message-content">Well, it's good to know that we're both on the same page when it comes to information security.<p class="message sent message-content">Definitely. It's important to stay ahead of the game and use the latest standards and practices to keep our company and clients safe.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0d05f30c-f56f-41b6-bedc-4482f022eb9f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
