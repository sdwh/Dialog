Do you have any idle belongings that you want to sell?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. I might have a few items lying around.<p class=message>Great! What kind of things do you have?<p class="message sent">Well, I have a guitar that I never really learned to play. And a set of golf clubs that have seen better days.<p class=message>Interesting. How much do you want for the guitar?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of selling it for around $200. It's almost brand new, barely been used.<p class=message>That sounds like a fair price. And what about the golf clubs?<p class="message sent">I'll let them go for $100. Like I said, they're not in the best condition, but they still work.<p class=message>Alright, I'll take the guitar off your hands. And maybe I'll think about the golf clubs too.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me! Let me know if you change your mind. Oh, and do you want a case for the guitar?<p class=message>Yes, please. Can you throw that in for an extra $20?<p class="message sent">Deal. Do you want to take a look at some other stuff I have for sale?<p class=message>Sure, why not? What else do you have?<p class="message sent">Well, I have some old books, a record player, and a bike.<p class=message>Hmm, the record player sounds cool. How much?<p class="message sent">I'll sell it to you for $50. It needs a bit of fixing up, but it's a classic.<p class=message>Alright, I'll take it. And maybe I'll check out those books too.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. I have some classics like Hemingway and Joyce, if you're interested.<p class=message>Definitely. Let's take a look. Do you have any other hobbies besides golf and playing guitar?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm into photography. I have a vintage camera that I might sell too.<p class=message>Really? I'm also into photography. Can I see it?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! It's a Yashica T4, and I'm selling it for a steal at $100.<p class=message>Wow, that's a great price. I'll have to think about it.<p class="message sent">Take your time. And if you want, I can give you some tips on how to take great photos with it.<p class=message>That would be awesome! I definitely need some help with my photography skills.<p class="message sent">No problem. We can go out shooting together sometime.<p class=message>That would be amazing! Thanks for all your help.<p class="message sent">Anytime! It's always great to meet fellow enthusiasts.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5a60561b-ac79-4722-b3c1-f96a65a6e7ff.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
