How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm well too, thank you for asking. So, let's get down to business. How do you feel about the initial design proposal?<p class="message sent">Overall, I really like it. I think the colors are beautiful and it definitely catches the eye. However, I am a bit concerned about the font choice for the headlines.<p class=message>Ah, yes. I can see where you're coming from. We do have a few other font options we can try out. Would you like me to show them to you?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. That would be great.<p class=message>Alright, let me pull those up for you. Oh, and I have to tell you, I got a new plant for the office! It's a snake plant and it's supposed to help clean the air.<p class="message sent">That's awesome! I'm all for improving the air quality in here.<p class=message>Yes, me too. And I'm hoping it'll bring some good energy to the space as well. But let me show you these new font options now.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's take a look. Hmm, I think I like this one the best. It has a nice balance of modern and classic.<p class=message>I agree, I think it works really well. Alright, let me make that change and update the design for you. Is there anything else you'd like to go over while we're here?<p class="message sent">No, I think that's it for now. Thank you for your help, A. And I hope your snake plant thrives!<p class=message>You're welcome, B, always happy to help. And thank you! I'll be sure to take good care of it. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6f90f645-2fa6-4fa9-874b-e35d12923f53.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
