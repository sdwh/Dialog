We're making good progress on this new feature.<p class=message>That's awesome to hear. Have you tried using any new libraries or frameworks for it?<p class="message sent">Yes, we decided to use Vue.js for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. How about you?<p class=message>We're also using Node.js on our end but we're experimenting with different testing frameworks.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. Which ones have you tried so far?<p class=message>We've given Jest and Mocha a spin. They both have their pros and cons, but we're leaning towards Jest at the moment.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. We've used Mocha before and it's been pretty solid for us.<p class=message>Yeah, it really comes down to personal preference and the project's specific needs.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. So, how's your day been going?<p class=message>Can't complain, just trying to stay on top of my tasks before the weekend.<p class="message sent">Same here. Any plans for the weekend?<p class=message>Not yet, probably just gonna take it easy and catch up on some reading. How about you?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of hitting up a local brewery with some friends. Maybe even play some board games afterwards.<p class=message>Sounds like a blast! Which brewery were you thinking of?<p class="message sent">There's this new one that just opened up a few weeks ago. It's called Hoppy Hippo. Want to join us?<p class=message>Thanks for the invite, but I'm not really into beer. I'll catch you guys next time though!<p class="message sent">No worries, A. We'll find something that we all enjoy next time. Have a great weekend!<p class=message>You too, B. Catch you later!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f893894d-6c8a-483b-be75-0b1297a92e6d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
