How's everything going tonight?<p class="message sent">Hi there, A! I'm pretty busy, but everything is going great! How about you?<p class=message>Busy as always, but that's a good thing in our line of work. So, what do we have on the menu tonight?<p class="message sent">Well, Chef, tonight's special is grilled salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. We also have a vegetarian pasta dish and a steak with garlic butter sauce.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! I'll make sure everything is fresh and perfect for our customers. Can you give me a heads up on any special requests or allergies we need to be aware of?<p class="message sent">Of course! Table 5 has a gluten allergy, Table 8 wants their steak medium-rare, and Table 10 is celebrating a birthday so they might want a dessert.<p class=message>Great, thanks for letting me know. I'll get started on the orders now.<p class="message sent">One more thing, Chef. The table for two near the window is interested in knowing your recommendations for the best dessert on the menu.<p class=message>I'd recommend our signature banana foster with vanilla ice cream, or our decadent chocolate lava cake. Trust me, they won't be disappointed.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Chef! I'll let them know. And by the way, your new fish dish is getting some great feedback from the customers!<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear! I worked hard on the recipe. Let's keep up the good work, B.<p class="message sent">Agreed! It's always a pleasure working with you, A.<p class=message>And with you too, B. Let's make sure we provide the best dining experience for our customers tonight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=527883ca-f358-4f80-ad4d-3cfeb570076c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
