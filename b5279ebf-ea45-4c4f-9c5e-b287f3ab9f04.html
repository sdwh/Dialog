Have you checked the results of the vulnerability scan yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. And let me tell you, it's a long list of issues we need to address.<p class=message>Of course, that's why we conduct these scans. Now, which vulnerabilities do you think we need to prioritize?<p class="message sent">Well, I noticed that the database itself has a few issues. We need to patch those as soon as possible.<p class=message>Agreed. I also saw that some of the servers have outdated software versions. We need to update those too.<p class="message sent">That's true. And we shouldn't forget that some of the passwords used by our users are weak. We should definitely enforce stronger password policies.<p class=message>Definitely. But let's not forget that social engineering attacks are also a big risk. We need to train our employees on how to detect and avoid them.<p class="message sent">Good point. We can never be too careful. By the way, have you heard about the latest phishing scam going around?<p class=message>No, what's the scoop?<p class="message sent">It's a classic one. They send an email disguised as a legitimate company and ask for personal information. We need to remind our employees not to fall for those tricks.<p class=message>Thanks for the heads up. We should definitely send out a reminder. Let's go ahead and create a plan to address all these issues. We don't want to leave any stone unturned.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And let's make sure we schedule regular vulnerability scans to catch any new issues that pop up.<p class=message>Yes, that's a great way to stay proactive. Thanks for your insights, B. We make a great team.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's all about keeping our data and users safe.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b5268a81-7583-40f1-ac6f-76a914ea560d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
