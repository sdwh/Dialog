How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">Not too bad. Just trying to navigate these crazy Taipei streets.<p class=message>I know right. It can be quite the adventure. Are you from Taipei originally?<p class="message sent">No, actually I'm from Taichung. But I've been driving a taxi in Taipei for a few years now.<p class=message>Wow, that's cool. Do you have any tips for someone new to Taipei?<p class="message sent">Yes, my biggest tip is to always bring an umbrella with you. You never know when it's going to rain.<p class=message>Good one. Any other tips?<p class="message sent">Yes, always carry some small change with you for street vendors. They're everywhere in Taipei and they usually only take cash.<p class=message>That's very helpful. Thanks! So, what's the weirdest thing that's ever happened to you while driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think... Oh yes, one time a passenger tried to pay me with a hamburger.<p class=message>(laughing) No way!<p class="message sent">Yeah, it was pretty funny. Obviously, I didn't take the hamburger.<p class=message>I wouldn't expect you to. (laughing) Have you ever had any famous passengers?<p class="message sent">Well, I once drove a local celebrity. But to be honest, I didn't know who she was until after she got out.<p class=message>(laughing) That's funny. Hey, do you have any favorite places to eat in Taipei?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love the night market scene in Taipei. There's so much delicious food to try.<p class=message>Agreed. What's your favorite night market?<p class="message sent">Definitely Raohe Night Market. Their black pepper buns are out of this world.<p class=message>Wow, I'll have to try those. Thanks for the recommendation. How much longer until we get to my destination?<p class="message sent">Just a few more minutes. We're almost there.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cccc51c3-bc50-486c-afb6-7b3e500750ad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
