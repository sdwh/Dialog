What's the secret ingredient?<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. We added a touch of rooibos tea to give it a unique South African flavor.<p class=message>That's brilliant! I love it when we infuse local ingredients into our beer. It makes it stand out.<p class="message sent">Yes, and it's not just the rooibos that does it. We've also added some Amarula cream to give it a creamy texture.<p class=message>Ooh, that sounds tasty. So, what's the next step in the brewing process?<p class="message sent">Well, we need to let it ferment for a few days, then we'll check the gravity levels and determine whether it's ready for kegging.<p class=message>Speaking of kegging, remember that time when we accidentally over-carbonated a batch and it exploded in our faces?<p class="message sent">Haha, how could I forget? We looked like a couple of cartoon characters with black ash on our faces.<p class=message>Good times. But seriously, we need to make sure we don't repeat that mistake.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, A. I've got it under control. I'll be checking the pressure levels multiple times a day.<p class=message>Excellent, I knew I could count on you. By the way, have you tried any of the other local brews here in Cape Town?<p class="message sent">Yes, I went to a brewery in Woodstock and tried their IPA. It was amazing.<p class=message>Nice, we should go there together sometime. But for now, let's focus on making the best South African-inspired beer out there!<p class="message sent">Agreed! Cheers to that, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f3ff70d4-ca6b-47c3-9f1a-6122efc510b2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
