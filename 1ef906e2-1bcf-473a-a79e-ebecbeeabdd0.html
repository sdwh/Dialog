It’s a security standard that organizations can use to protect sensitive data from being breached.<p class=message>Exactly! And did you know that data breaches can cost companies millions of dollars?<p class="message sent">Yes, and not to mention the damage it can do to a company’s reputation.<p class=message>Right, it can be a PR nightmare. But do you know how these breaches usually happen?<p class="message sent">Well, it could be anything from hacking to human error.<p class=message>Yes, sometimes it’s as simple as someone leaving their computer unlocked.<p class="message sent">That’s crazy! You’d think people would know better by now.<p class=message>You would think so, but unfortunately, it’s still a common mistake.<p class="message sent">I can imagine, but what can companies do to prevent data breaches?<p class=message>They can start by implementing security measures like firewalls and encryption, as well as training employees on proper security protocols.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. And how does the ISO 27001 standard fit into all of this?<p class=message>Well, it provides a framework for organizations to establish and maintain an information security management system.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So it’s sort of a roadmap for companies to follow in order to protect their data.<p class=message>Exactly! And with the rise of cyber threats, it’s more important than ever for companies to take data security seriously.<p class="message sent">Agreed! I’m glad we had this chat. Now I’m going to make sure my own passwords are secure!<p class=message>That’s the spirit! It’s always better to be safe than sorry.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1ef80611-6313-4d6b-94a7-89ed58f7bb23.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
