We need to understand the process for renting cars from your parking lot here.<p class=message>Sure thing. At the airport, all rental cars must be picked up and dropped off at our parking lot. You'll need to fill out some forms, show your driver's license, and a credit card for deposit.<p class="message sent">Sounds easy enough. What about insurance?<p class=message>Rental cars come with basic insurance, but you can always choose to purchase additional coverage to be on the safe side. It's usually a good idea to do so.<p class="message sent">Alright. And what about fuel refill?<p class=message>Rental cars come with a full tank of gas, and it's expected that you'll refill the tank before returning it. You can always choose to pre-pay for fuel at the rental company.<p class="message sent">Got it. What if there's an issue with the car?<p class=message>If anything goes wrong while you have the car, just give us a call and we'll assist you in resolving it. If it's a major issue, we'll have the rental company bring a replacement car.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the information. It seems like a very smooth process.<p class=message>Our goal is to make the rental process as easy and stress-free as possible. Let us know if you need any help during your stay here at the airport.<p class="message sent">Thanks, we appreciate it. You've been very helpful.<p class=message>No problem, happy to be of service. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bf871020-b389-40b5-87a9-68fd5b90697c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
