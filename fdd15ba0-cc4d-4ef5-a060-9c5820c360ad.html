My character just leveled up!<p class=message>Nice, congrats! What class did you choose?<p class="message sent">I went with a mage. I wanted to try something different this time.<p class=message>Ah, interesting choice. I'm still a warrior. Can never go wrong with a classic.<p class="message sent">Agreed. But speaking of trying something different, have you tried any new games lately?<p class=message>Yeah, I actually played a game where you play as a goose causing mischief in a town. It's called "Untitled Goose Game".<p class="message sent">Haha, that sounds hilarious! I might have to give it a try.<p class=message>You definitely should. What about you? Any new games you've tried?<p class="message sent">I actually played a game where you play as a ghost haunting a house. It's called "Phasmophobia".<p class=message>Oh man, that sounds spooky. Did it give you any nightmares?<p class="message sent">A little bit, but it was mostly just a lot of fun. You should try it too!<p class=message>Maybe I will. Do you want to team up and play together sometime?<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds like a blast! When are you free to play?<p class=message>How about this weekend? We can grab some snacks and play for a few hours.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan to me. I'll bring the chips!<p class=message>Awesome, I'll bring some drinks. Let's have some epic gaming sessions together!<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it! Can't wait for this weekend.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fdd106cc-7409-4374-990b-f93c12935dad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
