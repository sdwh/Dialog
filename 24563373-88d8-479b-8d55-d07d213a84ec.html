What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'd love a cappuccino and one of those delicious-looking pastries.<p class=message>Excellent choice! We have a variety of pastries, which one would you like?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'm eyeing that raspberry tart. Is it good?<p class=message>Oh, it's one of our bestsellers. You won't be disappointed. And your cappuccino, would you like it with regular milk or something non-dairy?<p class="message sent">Regular milk please. I've tried non-dairy before but it's just not the same.<p class=message>I hear you. Coming right up! In the meantime, can I tempt you with any of our other treats? We've got some fresh scones and muffins.<p class="message sent">Maybe next time. I can't resist the tart.<p class=message>Can't blame you. Here's your cappuccino and your raspberry tart. Enjoy!<p class="message sent">Mmm, this is delicious! The tanginess of the raspberry really complements the sweetness of the pastry.<p class=message>I'm glad you like it! Our head pastry chef really knows her stuff.<p class="message sent">I can tell. You guys do a great job here. By the way, do you offer catering services?<p class=message>We certainly do! We can provide pastries, cakes, and other treats for any occasion.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I work for a company that throws a lot of events, so I'll definitely keep you guys in mind.<p class=message>That would be fantastic. We also offer personalized cakes for birthdays and other celebrations, if you know anyone who needs one.<p class="message sent">I'll spread the word. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class=message>Of course. And thanks for stopping by today. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=244f6792-5af8-408f-aa74-1f8868b5128a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
