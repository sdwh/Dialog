What do you need assistance with?<p class=message>Well, I'm a bit nervous about going through security. Do you have any tips for making it smoother?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Make sure your liquids are packed in a clear, plastic bag and remove any electronics from your carry-on. Also, wear easy-to-remove shoes so you can quickly get through the metal detectors.<p class=message>Thanks! That makes me feel better. Is there anything I should know about customs?<p class="message sent">Yes, be sure to declare any items that you purchased abroad and make sure they are allowed in the country you're returning to. Don't forget to have your passport and boarding pass ready.<p class=message>Okay, good to know. I'm traveling with my family, is there a family line we can go through?<p class="message sent">Yes, there should be a designated family line. Just look for signs when you get to the airport.<p class=message>Perfect, that will make it easier for us. How much time should we allot for security?<p class="message sent">I'd recommend giving yourself at least two hours before your flight departs to ensure you have enough time for security and any unforeseen delays.<p class=message>Got it. Thanks for all of the help! You've made this process a lot less daunting.<p class="message sent">My pleasure! Have a safe and enjoyable trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5925f2f9-9cb7-49bf-a7f7-057b242ca6bf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
