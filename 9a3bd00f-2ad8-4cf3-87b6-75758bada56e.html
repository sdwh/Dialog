I'm excited to be working with you to open this new coffee shop.<p class="message sent">Good morning too! I'm thrilled to have you on board. What do you think should be our signature coffee?<p class=message>I think we should go with a blend of Central American and African beans. It'll have a smooth, chocolatey taste with a hint of fruitiness.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious. What about food? We need some tasty treats to go with our coffee.<p class=message>How about croissants, muffins, and scones? They're easy to make and they're always a hit with coffee drinkers.<p class="message sent">Perfect. And speaking of coffee drinkers, what kind of atmosphere do you think we should create here? Cozy? Rustic? Modern?<p class=message>I think a mix of cozy and modern would be great. We could have comfortable seating and some trendy decor.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. And what about the coffee cups and saucers? Should we go with plain white or something more colorful?<p class=message>I think we should have some fun with it and go for something colorful. Maybe we could have a variety of patterns and designs to choose from.<p class="message sent">I like it. And what about our hours? When should we open and close?<p class=message>I think we should open early, around 7 am, and close at around 7 or 8 pm. That way, we can cater to both morning and evening coffee drinkers.<p class="message sent">Excellent. Well, it looks like we have a lot to do before our grand opening. Shall we get to work?<p class=message>Let's do it! I'm excited to see our shop come to life.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9a37a837-31d4-40ba-a6c3-1122ee387b82.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
