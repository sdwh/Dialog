Where to?<p class=message>I'm heading to Boston. How long will it take?<p class="message sent">It usually takes around 2 hours, depending on the traffic. Do you have any preference for music?<p class=message>Hmm, something upbeat and happy would be nice.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me play some oldies that never fail to lift my spirits up. Who are some of your favorite artists?<p class=message>I love Beyonce and Ariana Grande.<p class="message sent">Beyonce and Ariana? You have a great taste! Speaking of Ariana, have you tried her famous Starbucks drink yet?<p class=message>No, I haven’t. Is it good?<p class="message sent">Well, it’s a bit sweet for my taste, but you should definitely try it out when you have the chance.<p class=message>I will, thanks for the recommendation. By the way, have you ever watched any Boston-based movies?<p class="message sent">Yes, of course! Good Will Hunting and The Departed are some of my favorites. Have you seen them?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I loved Good Will Hunting, but The Departed was too intense for me.<p class="message sent">I can see why. It’s definitely not for the faint-hearted. So, what brings you to Boston?<p class=message>My best friend is getting married there. I’m her maid of honor.<p class="message sent">Oh, how exciting! I bet it’s going to be a beautiful wedding. May I ask if you're married, ma'am?<p class=message>No, I'm not. But I do have a boyfriend. We’ve been together for a year now.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic. If you don't mind my asking, how did you two meet?<p class=message>We actually met through a dating app! It’s pretty common these days, don’t you think?<p class="message sent">I suppose it is. I had a friend who met his wife on a dating site, and they’ve been happily married for over ten years now.<p class=message>That’s lovely to hear. Alright, we’re here! Thank you for the great ride and conversation.<p class="message sent">You’re welcome, ma'am. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=247ae4d0-5891-4160-816e-dadc7d95832b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
