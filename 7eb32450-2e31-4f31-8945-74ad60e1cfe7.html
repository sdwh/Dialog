How's it going?<p class="message sent">Good to see you, A! Just reviewing your manuscript here. It's really coming together nicely.<p class=message>Thanks, I've been working on it for months. You know, I felt like I was going to turn into a hermit!<p class="message sent">Haha, I know the feeling. But your hard work is paying off. The characters are well developed, the plot is gripping, and the dialogue is fantastic.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'll admit, I was a little nervous about sending it in. But I'm glad it's in good hands.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. That's what we're here for, right?<p class=message>Definitely. So, any big changes that need to be made?<p class="message sent">Just a few minor tweaks, really. Maybe some spelling and grammar issues. And maybe we can make a few scenes a bit more engaging.<p class=message>Sounds good, I trust your judgement. Oh, by the way, have you ever heard of this program that generates titles for books?<p class="message sent">Ha, really? That sounds strange. What's it called?<p class=message>It's called "The Amazing Book Title Generator." It's hilarious, you should check it out.<p class="message sent">I'll definitely have to take a look. Who knows, maybe we'll find some inspiration for future projects!<p class=message>That's the spirit. Alright, I'll let you get back to editing. Thanks, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Looking forward to the final product!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7eb22d9c-a029-4c95-906b-3d6404cca670.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
