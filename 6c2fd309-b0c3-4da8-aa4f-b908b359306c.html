How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hi A! I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks for asking. So, I heard we're finally talking about implementing automated testing and deployment. It's about time!<p class="message sent">Yes, absolutely! We've been talking about it for a while now. I'm excited to see it finally come to fruition.<p class=message>Me too! I think it's going to make our jobs so much easier. No more manual testing and deployment!<p class="message sent">Agreed. Plus, it will help to catch potential issues early on in the development cycle, which will save us time and effort in the long run.<p class=message>Exactly! What kind of testing tools do you think we should look into?<p class="message sent">Well, I've been doing some research, and I think we should explore tools like Selenium for automated testing and Jenkins for deployment.<p class=message>Those sound like great options. I've used Jenkins before, and it's pretty user-friendly.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. Have you had any experience with Selenium?<p class=message>Not really, but I'm willing to learn. I've heard it's a powerful testing tool.<p class="message sent">It definitely is. We can also look into other options like Appium, which is specifically designed for mobile application testing.<p class=message>Interesting, I didn't know that. Maybe we can explore that for our mobile development projects.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And speaking of mobile development, we should also look into implementing continuous integration and delivery for our mobile apps.<p class=message>That's a great idea! It will help us to streamline the development process and reduce the risk of issues.<p class="message sent">Yes, and it will also help us to deliver updates to our users faster and more efficiently.<p class=message>Agreed. I can't wait to see how this will improve our overall development process.<p class="message sent">Me too! It's always exciting to embrace new technology and find ways to improve our workflow.<p class=message>Well, I think we've got a solid plan in place. Let's get started on implementing these changes!<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6c2d1759-06a3-4882-b435-a922c89223dc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
