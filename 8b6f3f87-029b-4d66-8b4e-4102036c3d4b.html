I have a delivery for your restaurant.<p class="message sent">Great! We've been eagerly awaiting our dim sum order. Can I help you with anything?<p class=message>That would be great. I have a few heavy boxes of hot steaming baskets.<p class="message sent">Oh, those must be the crispy fried shrimp dumplings and chicken feet dim sum. They are really popular here.<p class=message>They look delicious! I might have to try some myself. Do you mind if I stick around until you guys open?<p class="message sent">Not at all. In fact, I can show you how to properly eat the dim sum, if you'd like.<p class=message>That sounds like fun. Should I start with the chicken feet or shrimp dumplings?<p class="message sent">Let's start with the shrimp dumplings. They're stuffed with fresh shrimp and then steamed to perfection.<p class=message>Wow, these are really good! I can see why they're so popular.<p class="message sent">The secret is in the seasoning and fresh ingredients. We take pride in our food here.<p class=message>That's evident in the taste. I'll definitely be back for more. By the way, do you guys have any hot tea?<p class="message sent">Of course! We have many varieties of hot tea. Would you like something floral or fruity?<p class=message>Fruity sounds good. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Our peach and lychee tea is a customer favorite. It pairs well with the dim sum.<p class=message>Alright, I'll have a cup of that. Thanks for your hospitality.<p class="message sent">No problem. It's always great to share our love for food and culture with others.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8b6a0f0f-4eac-4973-8bf2-4ac61dffd029.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
