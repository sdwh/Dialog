We did a science experiment and I got to be the lab partner with my best friend.<p class=message>That sounds like fun. What experiment did you do?<p class="message sent">We made a volcano erupt with baking soda and vinegar. It was so cool!<p class=message>Wow, that does sound cool. Maybe we can try it at home sometime.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I think that would be awesome!<p class=message>Hey, look over there! There's a group of squirrels playing in that tree.<p class="message sent">They're so cute! Do you think we can feed them?<p class=message>I'm not sure if we're supposed to, but we can definitely watch them play.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. I love watching animals.<p class=message>Me too. Did you know that when I was your age, I wanted to be a wildlife biologist?<p class="message sent">Really? That's so cool, dad. What made you change your mind?<p class=message>Life happened, I guess. But it's never too late to pursue a passion, right?<p class="message sent">That's true. Maybe you can still become a wildlife biologist someday.<p class=message>Who knows? Maybe I will. But for now, I'm happy just enjoying this lovely walk with you.<p class="message sent">Me too, dad. This has been such a fun afternoon. Thanks for taking me to the park.<p class=message>Of course, son. Spending time with you is always a joy. Let's head back home and see what else we can do together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3208d098-3854-4458-8e35-0f4b29ae6038.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
