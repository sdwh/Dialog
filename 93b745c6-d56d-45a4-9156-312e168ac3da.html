I'm the dumpling chef. Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you too! I'm the noodle chef. Looks like we've got a lot of work to do today.<p class=message>Yes, indeed. I heard this place is quite popular for Chinese cuisine in Osaka.<p class="message sent">That's right. Our customers really enjoy our homemade dumplings and hand-pulled noodles.<p class=message>I bet they love the spicy Sichuan-style dumplings.<p class="message sent">Definitely! And our dan dan noodles are also a big hit.<p class=message>So, what's the plan for today? Do we have a lot of orders?<p class="message sent">We have a few big tables coming in later, but so far it's been steady. I'll get started on the noodle dough, and you can start prepping the fillings.<p class=message>Sounds good. I'm going to make some pork and chive dumplings first.<p class="message sent">Great! And while you're at it, I'll start boiling some chicken bones for broth.<p class=message>I love how we work so well together. We make a great team.<p class="message sent">Yes, we really do. And our ultimate goal is to bring a taste of China to Japan.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's all about the authenticity and quality of our food. Our customers deserve the best.<p class="message sent">Couldn't agree more. And it looks like our customers agree too; they keep coming back for more.<p class=message>Well, let's keep up the good work and continue to delight our customers with delicious dumplings and noodles.<p class="message sent">You got it! And maybe one day we can open up our own restaurant and showcase all of our culinary skills.<p class=message>That's a great idea! Who knows, maybe we'll become the next top chefs in Osaka!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=93b2bb8a-5df0-43c2-890a-1157c6bafc66.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
