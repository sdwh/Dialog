How's your day been so far?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! It's been busy as usual. We had a lot of orders for croissants and baguettes today.<p class=message>Your bread is always in demand. But I have to admit, it goes really well with the coffee I make.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Your coffee is the perfect way to start the day. I always have a cup before I even start baking.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Have you heard the latest news about the upcoming pastry competition?<p class="message sent">No, I haven’t. What’s the scoop?<p class=message>Apparently, the judges are looking for a unique twist on a classic French pastry. What do you have in mind to impress them, B?<p class="message sent">I'm thinking of creating a croissant that's filled with a sweet and savory surprise. And what about you, A? Will you be entering the competition?<p class=message>No, I'll be leaving the pastry making to the experts like you. But I'll definitely be cheering you on from the coffee station.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I appreciate your support. Hey, did I tell you that I'm planning to attend a coffee tasting workshop next week?<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. With your baking skills and my coffee expertise, we're sure to attract even more customers.<p class="message sent">I agree. We make a great team! Speaking of which, we should brainstorm a new promotion to attract more locals.<p class=message>Good idea. How about offering a discount to anyone who buys both a croissant and a latte?<p class="message sent">That's perfect. I can already picture the sign in the window. Thanks for your input, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. It's always a pleasure working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=da656cfe-6ba1-483d-82ca-3f35d10fefef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
