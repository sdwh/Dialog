I heard we're using Vue.js for the frontend and ASP.NET MVC 5 for the backend, right?<p class=message>Yup, that's correct. What do you think about working with these technologies?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm excited to work on the backend using ASP.NET MVC 5. It's always been my favorite.<p class=message>That's cool, but I'm more excited about Vue.js. I love working on the frontend and I've heard great things about Vue.js.<p class="message sent">Oh really? I haven't had a chance to work with it yet. What makes you like it so much?<p class=message>Well, it's easy to learn and it makes the frontend development process so much smoother. Plus, it's so well documented and has a large community, which makes it even better.<p class="message sent">Hmm, sounds interesting. I might have to check it out after this project is done.<p class=message>Definitely! I think you'll love it. But for now, let's focus on the project we're working on. Do you have any ideas for the backend?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. I think we should use Entity Framework Code First to make the data access layer more efficient.<p class=message>Ah, I see. That's a good idea. And for the frontend, I think we should use Vuex for state management. It will make it so much easier to manage the data.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan to me. Let's get started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8679ed07-d8e4-452b-a2ad-763ce0bd6f8e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
