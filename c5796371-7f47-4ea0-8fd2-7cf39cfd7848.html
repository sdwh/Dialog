So, what's the plan for the itinerary feature?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of making it interactive and easy to use, what do you think?<p class="message sent">Sounds great! How about allowing users to drag and drop activities to different days?<p class=message>Yes, and we could add a filter for different types of activities like museums, restaurants or outdoor activities.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! And we could use GPS to suggest nearby activities based on the user's location.<p class=message>Amazing! We could also add a feature to allow users to share their itinerary with friends.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And we should make it easy for users to make changes to their itinerary on the go.<p class=message>How about adding a feature where users can leave reviews and ratings for the activities they've done?<p class="message sent">Yes, that would be helpful for other users. And we could display the most popular activities in a separate section.<p class=message>Love it! And what about adding a feature to show estimated travel time between activities?<p class="message sent">Brilliant! We could even use AI to analyze traffic and suggest the best route.<p class=message>Yes, that would make travel planning so much easier. Overall, the itinerary feature would be the highlight of our travel app.<p class="message sent">I agree, A. I can't wait to see the final product and how our users will enjoy planning their trips!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5753823-067d-495b-b978-01f46a923d5d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
