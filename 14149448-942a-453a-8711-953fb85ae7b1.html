What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there, I'm the server. We have a customer in the corner who's been eyeing the desserts. Can you whip up something sweet and satisfying?<p class=message>Of course! What kind of flavors does the customer prefer?<p class="message sent">She likes fruity flavors, and maybe something with chocolate. But nothing too heavy.<p class=message>I have just the thing - a mixed berry tart with a chocolate drizzle. It's light and refreshing.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! And what kind of coffee do you recommend pairing with that?<p class=message>I'd suggest a medium roast. It has enough flavor to complement the tart but won't overpower it.<p class="message sent">Great, I'll grab a medium roast for her. How long do you need to prepare the tart?<p class=message>Just a few minutes. I'll start on it now.<p class="message sent">Awesome, thank you so much! I'll bring it out as soon as it's ready.<p class=message>You're welcome. And let me know if there's anything else you need.<p class="message sent">Will do! By the way, have you tried any of our other desserts? Our caramel apple pie is to die for.<p class=message>Oh, I believe you. I've been wanting to try it myself. Maybe I'll grab a slice during my break.<p class="message sent">You definitely should! You deserve a treat after all your hard work here.<p class=message>Thanks for the recommendation. I'll make sure to leave some room for it.<p class="message sent">Anytime! And thank you for making such delicious treats. Our customers love them.<p class=message>It's my pleasure. I love being able to share my passion for baking with everyone.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1412be9e-c3d6-4b2e-b963-256f8bfecb4e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
