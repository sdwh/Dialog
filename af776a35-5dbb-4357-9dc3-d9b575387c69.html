How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi, A. I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing alright. Just trying to figure out what's wrong with this machine. Can you give me a hand?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'd love to help. What seems to be the problem?<p class=message>I think there's a loose wire somewhere, but I just can't seem to locate it. Can you take a look at the wiring diagram and see if you can spot anything?<p class="message sent">No problem. Let me get my glasses. (pause) Ah, I see what the issue is. It looks like the connection between these two wires needs to be tightened.<p class=message>I see it now. Great eye, B. (pause) Alright, let me grab the tools and we'll get to work.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. (pause) Hey, did you hear about that new restaurant that just opened up down the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's it called?<p class="message sent">It's called "The Hungry Engineer." I heard they serve great food and drinks.<p class=message>That sounds like a place I'd like to check out. Maybe we can grab lunch there once we're done fixing this machine.<p class="message sent">Definitely. (pause) Hey, speaking of food, have you ever tried the fried chicken from that diner on 5th street?<p class=message>Oh yeah, I love that place. The chicken is always so crispy and juicy.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. It's my go-to spot for a quick and tasty lunch.<p class=message>Have you tried their mac and cheese? It's amazing.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I'll have to give it a try next time I'm there.<p class=message>Definitely do. So, how's your family doing?<p class="message sent">They're doing well, thanks for asking. My daughter just started kindergarten and she loves it.<p class=message>That's great to hear. How old is she now?<p class="message sent">She's 5. Time really flies, doesn't it?<p class=message>Yeah, it does. My son just turned 3 last month and it feels like he was just born yesterday.<p class="message sent">I know how you feel. (pause) Alright, I think we're all done here. Let's turn the machine on and see if it's working properly.<p class=message>Good idea. (pause) Hey, it looks like we fixed it. Nice work, B.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. It was great working with you. And don't forget, lunch at "The Hungry Engineer" is on me.<p class=message>You got it. Thanks again, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=af74384b-4eff-47bb-a9fe-95c0f84fc077.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
