What happened?<p class=message>Apparently, Mr. Chen was teaching and he asked the student a question, but the student fell asleep!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Oh no, that's hilarious!<p class=message>I know, right? Mr. Chen didn't know what to do, so he just moved on and asked another student.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Poor Mr. Chen. Did he wake the student up?<p class=message>Yeah, he did. But the student was so embarrassed that he didn't answer any questions for the rest of class.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's too bad. I hope he was able to catch up later.<p class=message>Yeah, me too. And I hope he doesn't fall asleep again in class.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Definitely not. Hey, did you hear about the time when Mr. Chen accidentally wrote on the whiteboard with a permanent marker?<p class=message>(laughs) No way! What did he do?<p class="message sent">He tried to erase it with an eraser, but it wouldn't come off. He ended up having to use a special cleaner to remove it.<p class=message>(laughs) Mr. Chen always seems to have some funny stories in class.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, he sure does. It makes class more entertaining.<p class=message>Definitely. But we should also remember to pay attention and not fall asleep like that one student.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Agreed. Wouldn't want to miss any of Mr. Chen's funny moments.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c8b81690-bef3-49fc-ac9b-c88987a20f3c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
