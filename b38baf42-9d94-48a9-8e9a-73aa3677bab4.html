Have you had a chance to take a look at the penetration test results?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. It looks like we have a few vulnerabilities in our database system that the tester was able to exploit.<p class=message>Oh no. That doesn't sound good. What kind of vulnerabilities were they able to exploit?<p class="message sent">Well, one was a SQL injection vulnerability. They were able to gain access to sensitive data by inserting malicious code into one of our web forms.<p class=message>Yikes. That's definitely something we'll need to patch up ASAP.<p class="message sent">Agreed. They also found a few outdated software packages that were susceptible to known exploits. We'll need to update those as well.<p class=message>It seems like there's always something to patch up in the world of cybersecurity!<p class="message sent">Definitely. But that's what keeps us in business, right?<p class=message>Ha, you're right about that. And at least we're not working in an industry where our customers' safety is in question!<p class="message sent">True. It could be worse. At least we're keeping our systems secure and running smoothly as best we can.<p class=message>Absolutely. Well, thanks for taking a look at those results, B. Let's get to work on patching up those vulnerabilities before anyone else has a chance to exploit them.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, A. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b38a2481-0560-404a-b701-2adcf2a2f890.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
