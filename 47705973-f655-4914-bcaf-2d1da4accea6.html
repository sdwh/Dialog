How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing pretty good too. I was just going over the latest inventory report and noticed that we'll be running low on chips and soda soon.<p class="message sent">Oh no! We can't have our customers going without their snacks and drinks. What can we do?<p class=message>I was thinking we could start by placing a bulk order for both. That way, we'll have enough to last us for a while.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. Would you mind taking care of the ordering for the snacks while I handle the soda?<p class=message>Sounds fair to me. I'll check with our suppliers and see if we can get any discounts for our bulk order.<p class="message sent">Excellent. In the meantime, have you looked into our delivery schedule? When can we expect the snacks and soda to arrive?<p class=message>Yes, I have. The snacks will be shipped next week, and the soda will be here in about two weeks.<p class="message sent">Great! That should be plenty of time for us to restock our shelves. Is there anything else we need to discuss?<p class=message>No, I think that's it for today. Thanks for all your help, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Let's make sure this next delivery goes smoothly for our customers.<p class=message>Agreed. See you later, B!<p class="message sent">See you later, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=476ed6fc-3b7d-4d9a-8129-2f782bc3bdba.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
