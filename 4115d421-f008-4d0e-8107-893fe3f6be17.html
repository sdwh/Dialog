Welcome to our restaurant. I'm the manager, and you must be our new server, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right! I'm excited to be here and learn about the food and beverages.<p class=message>Well, we want our servers to be knowledgeable about our menu and wine list. Let's start with a glass of our house champagne to get things rolling.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. This is such a beautiful setting, by the way.<p class=message>Yes, we're located in the heart of wine country. Speaking of which, have you tried our wine flight? It pairs perfectly with our tasting menu.<p class="message sent">I haven't yet, but I'd love to learn more about it.<p class=message>Absolutely! Our flight showcases three local wines and includes tasting notes and pairing suggestions. It's a great way to sample the flavors of the region.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds perfect for our guests who are new to wine. How about the food? What do you recommend?<p class=message>Our chef's tasting menu is always a popular choice, highlighting our freshest and most delicious local ingredients.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to taste it myself. And what if someone has dietary restrictions?<p class=message>No problem at all. We have vegetarian and gluten-free options available, and our servers are trained to assist with any other dietary needs.<p class="message sent">That's great to know. I'm really excited to be a part of this team and help our guests have an unforgettable experience.<p class=message>That's what we strive for. And remember, the key is to make them feel at home and relaxed while enjoying our delicious food and beverages.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Cheers to that!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=41014762-19a6-423b-8cc5-38c46b9ffa6c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
