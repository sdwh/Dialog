What kind of tests have you been performing so far?<p class=message>We've been doing manual and automated testing, but I feel like there's still some room for improvement.<p class="message sent">That's understandable. What about exploratory testing, have you tried that yet?<p class=message>Not extensively, but I think it could be a valuable addition to our testing approach.<p class="message sent">Definitely, it can uncover issues that may not have been caught through other testing methods. Have you considered utilizing test coverage tools?<p class=message>Yes, we've been using some, but I'm not sure if we're maximizing their potential.<p class="message sent">Well, we could review our current tools and explore new ones to ensure we're fully utilizing them. Another consideration could be incorporating code reviews into our testing process.<p class=message>That's a great idea. Collaboration between the development and testing teams can only improve our process.<p class="message sent">Exactly, and it also helps to bring attention to potential issues early on. Lastly, we could periodically reevaluate our testing methods to ensure they remain effective.<p class=message>These are all fantastic suggestions. Thanks for your help, I'm feeling a lot more confident about achieving full test coverage.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d8574e4b-8561-478a-ba08-fee6d1720cf3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
