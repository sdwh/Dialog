Thanks for agreeing to meet with me today. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. My name is Sarah and I'm a freelance writer. I love to write about travel and food.<p class=message>That's really interesting. What's your favorite travel destination so far?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a tough one. I would have to say Japan. The culture and food there is just amazing.<p class=message>I've never been to Japan, but I've always wanted to go. What's your favorite Japanese dish?<p class="message sent">I love sushi, but I also really enjoy tonkatsu, which is deep-fried pork cutlets.<p class=message>Yum, those both sound delicious. So, what inspired you to become a freelance writer?<p class="message sent">Well, I've always loved writing, but I also enjoy having the freedom to choose my own projects and work from wherever I want.<p class=message>That sounds like a great perk. Do you have any advice for aspiring writers or freelancers out there?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I would say to network as much as possible and never stop learning. And don't be afraid to take risks and try new things.<p class=message>That's good advice. So, what's next for you in your writing career?<p class="message sent">I have a few projects in the works, including a travel guide to Japan and a cookbook featuring some of my favorite recipes.<p class=message>Wow, those both sound like exciting projects. Thanks so much for chatting with me today, Sarah.<p class="message sent">Thanks for having me! It was great to chat with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=61811490-af01-409c-9736-746e03e289ad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
