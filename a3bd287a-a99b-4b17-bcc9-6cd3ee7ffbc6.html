Let's start our stand-up meeting today. B, how is the progress of the current project?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. Things are moving along smoothly. We are currently testing the new feature that we just finished coding yesterday.<p class=message>Great to hear that, B. Any concerns or issues that need to be addressed?<p class="message sent">No major issues so far, except for the occasional bug that we encounter during testing. But we are able to squash them immediately.<p class=message>That's great to know. By the way, did you guys hear about the new ping pong table that they set up in the break room?<p class="message sent">Yes, I heard about it! I'm excited to try it out later.<p class=message>Me too! Maybe we could have a friendly match during our break later?<p class="message sent">Sure, I would be up for that. Speaking of breaks, have you guys tried the new coffee machine? The latte it makes is amazing!<p class=message>Actually, I haven't tried it yet. Maybe we can all go together during our lunch break and grab some latte.<p class="message sent">Count me in! How about you, C and D? Would you like to join us?<p class=message>Great, it's settled then. We'll have a ping pong match during our break and grab some latte afterwards. Anything else that we need to discuss?<p class="message sent">Nope, I think that's it for now. Let's get back to work and finish our tasks for the day.<p class=message>Alright then, let's have a productive day everyone!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a3bcd0f9-43ba-4e40-8974-44eeea3c76ec.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
