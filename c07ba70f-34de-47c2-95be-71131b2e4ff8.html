Any cause for concern?<p class="message sent">Hey! Well, it's looking okay so far. But there's some rain expected later on.<p class=message>I see. How might that affect our flights?<p class="message sent">Well, it could cause some delays. Especially if the rain gets heavy.<p class=message>That's not what I wanted to hear. But I guess it's better to be prepared. Thanks for letting me know.<p class="message sent">No worries! We always want to make sure our pilots have the most up-to-date information.<p class=message>So, what do you like most about your job here at the airport?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a good question. I think it's the variety. Every day is different and there's always something new to learn.<p class=message>Yeah, I can imagine. I definitely know what it's like to have a job with lots of variety.<p class="message sent">Oh, really? What do you do?<p class=message>I'm an airline pilot. So, I get to travel to lots of different places and see so many different things.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing! What's your favourite place you've ever travelled to?<p class=message>Oh, that's a tough one. I've been to so many beautiful places. I think the Maldives might be my favourite though.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's definitely on my bucket list. It looks like paradise!<p class=message>It really is. And with this weather forecast, I might need to plan another trip there soon!<p class="message sent">Ha! I don't blame you. Well, let's hope the rain clears up and your flights all leave on time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c0787f8b-9205-4d33-a134-192f0bea8db9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
