What can I do for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi! I need a trim and some layers.<p class=message>Sure thing! Have you thought about how much you'd like taken off?<p class="message sent">Just enough to get rid of the split ends, please.<p class=message>Absolutely. Do you want me to keep the length, or go a bit shorter?<p class="message sent">I'd like to keep most of the length, if possible.<p class=message>No problem. And what about layers, do you have a preference?<p class="message sent">I want something that makes my hair look fuller and more voluminous.<p class=message>I get you. How about some face-framing layers and some shorter pieces in the back?<p class="message sent">That sounds great! Let's do it.<p class=message>Excellent. Is there anything else you'd like me to do? Style, blow-dry, or just leave it natural?<p class="message sent">Just a quick blow-dry, please. I'm in a bit of a rush.<p class=message>Got it. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the pampering!<p class="message sent">Thanks! It's nice to be taken care of every once in a while.<p class=message>Our pleasure. So what occasion are you getting your hair done for?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have a date tonight. So I want to look my best!<p class=message>Ooh, exciting! Where are you going?<p class="message sent">We're just going to a local restaurant. Nothing fancy, but I still want to make a good impression.<p class=message>I'm sure you will. And who knows, maybe this could be the start of something great.<p class="message sent">That's what I'm hoping for! Thanks for the words of encouragement.<p class=message>Of course! Now, let's get back to your hair. It's looking fab already, but let's make sure it's perfect for your big night out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ac3d2bff-7a98-408b-a6e0-73226a710192.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
