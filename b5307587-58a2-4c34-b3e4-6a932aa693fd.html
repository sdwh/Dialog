It's great to be here!<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely. So, you've got a new novel coming up?<p class=message>Yes, it's a romantic comedy set in New York.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. What's the title?<p class=message>It's called "Love in the Big Apple."<p class="message sent">Hmm, I like it. Have you thought about the cover design?<p class=message>Yes, I was thinking of a modern, abstract illustration of the city skyline.<p class="message sent">I think that would work well. How about the font?<p class=message>I was thinking of a bold, sans-serif font for the title, and a more traditional serif font for the author's name.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Have you considered the target audience?<p class=message>Definitely. I think it would appeal to young adults who are looking for a light-hearted and fun read.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good market. Have you reached out to any publishers yet?<p class=message>Yes, I've sent out a few query letters. Hopefully, I'll hear back soon.<p class="message sent">Great. In the meantime, I think it would be a good idea to get some beta readers to give you feedback on the manuscript.<p class=message>Yes, that's a good point. I'll look into that. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class="message sent">No problem. And if you're interested, I could also connect you with a book designer and a marketing consultant.<p class=message>That would be amazing. Thank you so much, B!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. It's always a pleasure to work with talented authors like yourself.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b52fa946-bab9-4ad0-a65e-1f4341a93671.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
