How was the crowd tonight?<p class="message sent">It was great! They loved our new cocktail menu.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear. Which cocktail was the bestseller?<p class="message sent">The "Marina Bay Breeze" was a hit! It's a combination of vodka, pineapple juice, and blue curacao.<p class=message>That sounds refreshing. What about the view? Did the customers enjoy it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. The view of the bay and the city skyline is simply breathtaking.<p class=message>That's our selling point, after all. Speaking of which, I heard we have a private function booked next week.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a corporate party. So, I've prepared some special drinks with corporate logos on them.<p class=message>That's a nice touch. What about our regulars? Have they been coming in as usual?<p class="message sent">Yes, they have. I think the live music nights have been a big hit with them.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What do you suggest we do to keep the momentum going?<p class="message sent">Maybe we can start offering some food pairings with our cocktails. It'll be a new experience.<p class=message>That's a brilliant idea! Let's work on that. By the way, I heard you won an award for your mixology skills.<p class="message sent">Yes, I did! I won the "Best Mixologist" award at the Singapore Bartender Awards.<p class=message>Congratulations! We're lucky to have you as our head bartender.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much! I'm glad to be part of this team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=316464ff-ddf4-4a65-ba39-3277c3dbb710.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
