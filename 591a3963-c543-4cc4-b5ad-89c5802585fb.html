It's always a pleasure to see you at the pharmacy.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! The pleasure is mine. How can I be of assistance today?<p class=message>I have a patient who has been taking medication for a while but hasn't seen much improvement. I'm thinking of adjusting the dosage.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a good idea. What medication is it?<p class=message>It's for hypertension. He's been taking 20mg of Lisinopril, but I think we should up it to 40mg.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's quite a jump. We should monitor his blood pressure closely. How about we start with a 30mg dose?<p class=message>That's a good idea. I don't want to shock his system with a sudden increase.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We want to avoid any adverse side effects. Does he have any allergies or other medications he's taking?<p class=message>No, he's pretty healthy aside from this hypertension. I'll make sure to inform him of the changes.<p class="message sent">Great. Also, remind him to take the medication at the same time every day. Consistency is key.<p class=message>Will do! Hey B, do you have any fun plans for the weekend?<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm thinking of going on a hike with some friends. How about you?<p class=message>That sounds lovely. I'm going to catch up on some reading and maybe try out a new recipe.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a relaxing weekend. Let me know how the recipe turns out!<p class=message>I will! Thanks for the advice on adjusting the dosage. I always appreciate your expertise.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. That's what I'm here for. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5918a138-4430-450c-9172-ee8c8be7f309.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
