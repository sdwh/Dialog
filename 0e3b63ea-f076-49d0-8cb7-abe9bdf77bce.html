How about you?<p class="message received message-content">Can't complain, just excited to be having lunch with my little sister.<p class="message sent message-content">(laughs) I'm not that little anymore, sis.<p class="message received message-content">You'll always be my little sister, no matter what. So, what are you in the mood for?<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, I was thinking maybe some sushi or ramen?<p class="message received message-content">Sounds good to me. How's school been?<p class="message sent message-content">It's been busy, but good. I'm really enjoying my Japanese class.<p class="message received message-content">That's great to hear! I remember struggling with Japanese when I took it in college.<p class="message sent message-content">(laughs) Well, I hope I don't struggle too much. Do you have any advice for me?<p class="message received message-content">Just keep practicing and don't be afraid to make mistakes. That's how you learn, right?<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely. Speaking of learning, have you picked up any new hobbies recently?<p class="message received message-content">Actually, I started baking! I made some really yummy cookies and cupcakes last weekend.<p class="message sent message-content">That's awesome! Can I taste some of your treats sometime?<p class="message received message-content">Of course! Maybe we can have a baking day together and make something fun.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds like a plan. Hey, have you heard about that new movie coming out? I really want to see it.<p class="message received message-content">Which one?<p class="message sent message-content">The one about the superhero with the cool powers.<p class="message received message-content">Oh, you mean "Incredibles 2"? I've been dying to see it too.<p class="message sent message-content">Yes! Let's plan a movie night with the family soon.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds like a great idea. (smiles) I always have so much fun hanging out with you, B.<p class="message sent message-content">Me too, A. You're the best big sister a girl could ask for.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0e3067f4-ba2a-422b-aa96-2a19180de434.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
