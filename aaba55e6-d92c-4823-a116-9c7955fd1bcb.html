I've already gone on a crocodile tour and visited a few museums. What do you recommend I check out next?<p class=message>Well, you definitely have to try some local cuisine. Have you tried barramundi yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's that?<p class=message>It's a type of fish that's native to Australia. It's really popular in Darwin because there's so much fresh seafood here.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. Where's the best place to try it?<p class=message>I would recommend going to a local market, like the Mindil Beach Sunset Market. They have all kinds of food stalls where you can try different dishes.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. What else should I do while I'm here?<p class=message>You might want to check out the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. They have a great collection of Aboriginal art and artifacts.<p class="message sent">That sounds really interesting. I'll definitely add that to my list.<p class=message>And if you're feeling adventurous, you could go on a camping trip in Kakadu National Park. It's only about three hours away from Darwin.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing. I might have to extend my trip so I can fit all of this in.<p class=message>Haha, it's easy to get carried away in Darwin. There's so much to do and see.<p class="message sent">I'm starting to see that. Thanks for all your recommendations, I really appreciate it.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. Have fun exploring!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aab9f216-7585-4df1-b86b-55138bfd0c2c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
