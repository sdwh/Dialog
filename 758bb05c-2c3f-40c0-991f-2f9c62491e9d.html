What kind of features are you thinking about implementing for it?<p class="message sent">Hi A, nice to see you. Yes, we're designing an app that can track users' exercise progress and offer workout recommendations based on their fitness goals.<p class=message>Sounds cool. How are you going to track user progress? Through wearables or phone sensors?<p class="message sent">We are thinking of implementing both. Users can connect their wearables to the app or use phone sensors to track their fitness data. That way, they can choose whichever works best for them.<p class=message>Makes sense. And what kind of workout plans are you planning to offer users?<p class="message sent">We want to offer personalized workout suggestions based on the user's input of their fitness level, preferred exercise type and duration, and health goals. It will help them stay motivated and make progress towards their fitness targets.<p class=message>Great idea! How will you present the workout recommendations to the users in a clear and easy-to-understand format?<p class="message sent">We're planning on creating visual aids and using intuitive graphics to showcase the recommended exercises. This way, users can understand everything they need to do to achieve their targets.<p class=message>Nice. Speaking of achieving fitness goals, we need to make sure users stay motivated. Do you have any ideas on how we could do that?<p class="message sent">One idea is to incorporate a social aspect to the app. People can share their progress and results with their friends and family, and cheer each other on. We could also include a leaderboard for users to compete with each other and have fun while getting fit.<p class=message>Love that. How long do you think it will take to develop this app?<p class="message sent">Let's aim for around 6 months. We'll need to iterate on the design and conduct user testing to make sure it's meeting people's needs.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I'm excited to get started on this project. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Looking forward to working together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=758b2979-9fc1-4fca-a55f-174b108f89be.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
