How are you doing?<p class="message sent">I'm great, thanks for asking! What can I get for you?<p class=message>I'm one of the bakers here, actually. I just wanted to say that your coffee smells amazing.<p class="message sent">Thank you! It's made from freshly roasted beans. Speaking of which, have you tried our new sourdough loaf?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it good?<p class="message sent">It's fantastic! The dough is fermented for 24 hours, giving it a slightly sour taste and a chewy texture. Would you like to try it with your coffee?<p class=message>That sounds perfect! And maybe you could try our new cinnamon rolls? They're still warm from the oven.<p class="message sent">I'd love to! I'm a sucker for anything with cinnamon.<p class=message>Great! Maybe we can do a taste test. I'll bring over a couple slices of sourdough and you can bring over a couple cinnamon rolls.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. By the way, do you have any insider tips on how to make crusty, artisan bread?<p class=message>Actually, I do. The secret is to add steam to the oven during the first few minutes of baking. It creates a crispy crust and helps the bread rise.<p class="message sent">Ah, that makes sense. Thanks for the tip! I'll have to try it out next time I'm in the kitchen.<p class=message>And I'll have to come over to the counter more often to sample your coffee creations.<p class="message sent">Anytime! We can make it a weekly tradition.<p class=message>Deal! But first, let's indulge in these delicious treats.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Cheers to fresh bread and coffee.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bddd4af3-17ba-48de-9bfa-9fe70506759f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
