Let's start the stand-up meeting. B, would you like to go first with your update?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm currently working on the homepage design. It's going well. I added some fun animations and colors to make it more appealing.<p class=message>Sounds great. Any challenges or blockers?<p class="message sent">Nothing too major, but I'm waiting for final approval from the creative team. Other than that, it's smooth sailing.<p class=message>Nice, keep up the good work. As for me, I've been busy coordinating with the development team. We're trying to finalize the timeline for the project.<p class="message sent">That's always a challenge. Do you need any help with that?<p class=message>Actually, yes. I could use some input on how long it usually takes for the design to be fully implemented.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. From my experience, it usually takes about two weeks. But we can probably shave off a couple of days if everything runs smoothly.<p class=message>Thanks for the heads up. I'll take note of that.<p class="message sent">No problem. Oh, by the way, did you see the new meme making the rounds on social media about web design?<p class=message>(laughs) No, I haven't. What is it?<p class="message sent">It's a picture of a designer with multiple browser windows open and the caption says "When you're QA, DevOps, and UX all at once."<p class=message>(laughs) I can relate to that. We wear many hats in this industry.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Anyway, that's my update for today. Looking forward to seeing everyone's progress.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d41dda90-7bd3-4024-a323-3a506a63ae88.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
