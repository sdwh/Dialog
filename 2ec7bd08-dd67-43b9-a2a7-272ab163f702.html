Did you have a good weekend?<p class="message sent">Hi there, A! Yes, it was great. I finally finished binge-watching Stranger Things.<p class=message>Nice! I've been meaning to watch it too. Hey, have you made any progress on our Node.js project?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I added a new endpoint for user authentication. It's pretty secure.<p class=message>That's awesome! And I optimized the backend code for better performance.<p class="message sent">Great job, A! Have you tried out the new lunch spot?<p class=message>Not yet, but I heard they have great Korean BBQ.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I've been there three times already this month. I highly recommend it.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! We should go there for lunch sometime this week.<p class="message sent">Yeah, let's do it. Oh, by the way, did you hear about the new intern?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's the news?<p class="message sent">Apparently he's a coding prodigy. He's only 17 and has already built his own language.<p class=message>Woah, that's impressive. Maybe we can learn a thing or two from him.<p class="message sent">For sure! And who knows, he might even teach us a new skill or two.<p class=message>Well, speaking of new skills, I should probably start learning React. Have you tried it out yet?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. It's great for building complex frontend applications.<p class=message>Awesome, thanks for the recommendation. I'll definitely give it a try.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2ec5d2e0-8e25-4f37-8296-325b655c6440.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
