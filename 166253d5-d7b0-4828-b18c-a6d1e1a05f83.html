May I see your driver's license and vehicle registration, please?"<p class="message sent">"Sure thing, officer. Here you go."<p class=message>"Thank you. Just a quick observation, I noticed your tail-light is out. Have you been meaning to get that fixed?"<p class="message sent">"Yeah, I know. I keep forgetting to take it to the mechanic."<p class=message>"I understand. It's a common mistake. But it's important to keep all your vehicle lights working properly for your own safety as well as that of other road users."<p class="message sent">"Absolutely. I'll definitely get it fixed as soon as possible."<p class=message>"Great. So can you tell me the reason why you were driving 10 kilometers above the speed limit before I pulled you over?"<p class="message sent">"Oh, I was running a bit late for an appointment."<p class=message>"I see. Well, it's important to always observe the speed limit on the road for the safety of everyone on it. I'll just give you a verbal warning this time, but please be more aware in the future."<p class="message sent">"Thank you, officer. I appreciate it."<p class=message>"No problem. So, how's your day going so far?"<p class="message sent">"Pretty good. Just hoping to finish my errands and head back home soon."<p class=message>"Understandable. Well, I hope the rest of your day goes smoothly."<p class="message sent">"Thank you, officer. You too. Stay safe out there on the road."<p class=message>"Will do.
