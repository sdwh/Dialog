How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing pretty good, thanks. Are you ready to start rehearsal?<p class=message>Yes, I am. I'm really excited about the new piece you've created.<p class="message sent">Great to hear that. So, let's begin with some warm-up exercises first.<p class=message>Sure, I'm up for it. But I hope it's not anything too strenuous.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I won't push you too hard. We just need to get the blood flowing.<p class=message>Okay, that sounds manageable. What's the theme of the new dance?<p class="message sent">It's a romantic piece inspired by the famous ballet, "Swan Lake."<p class=message>Oh, that's one of my favorites. I can't wait to see what you've come up with.<p class="message sent">I hope it lives up to your expectations. Let's start with the opening sequence.<p class=message>Sounds good. Do you want me to perform it with a prop?<p class="message sent">Yes, please grab the feathered fan. It'll be perfect for the theme.<p class=message>Got it. Let's do this!<p class="message sent">Great job, A! That was a perfect start. Let's move on to the partnering section.<p class=message>I love partnering work. Who will be my partner for this piece?<p class="message sent">You'll be working with C. He's a new member of our company, but he's a fantastic dancer.<p class=message>Oh, that's exciting. It'll be great to work with someone new. Let's give it a shot.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Keep up the good work, you two. We'll end the rehearsal here for today. But I'm really proud of what we accomplished today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f3ed197b-4db1-4f34-ad07-e76c306a69df.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
