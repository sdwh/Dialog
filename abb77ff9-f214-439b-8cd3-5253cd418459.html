I'm A, the food formula developer. Nice to meet you, B, the baker.<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm excited to be working with you on this new product.<p class=message>Me too. So, what do you think of the recipe I've come up with?<p class="message sent">Honestly, it's a bit unusual. But that's what makes it interesting, right?<p class=message>Yes! I wanted to incorporate some traditional Korean flavors into this Western-style pastry.<p class="message sent">I see. It's definitely a bold move.<p class=message>And what do you think of the instructions? Are they clear enough for you to make it easily?<p class="message sent">Yes, they're very thorough. I appreciate that. But I do have one suggestion for improvement.<p class=message>Oh, what's that?<p class="message sent">Maybe you could add some tips on presentation. After all, even the tastiest food needs to look appealing.<p class=message>Great idea! I'll make sure to include that in the final version.<p class="message sent">Awesome. Let's get started with testing. Have you prepared all the ingredients?<p class=message>Yeah, everything's ready to go. Let's make some delicious magic happen!<p class="message sent">Haha, I like your enthusiasm. Okay, let's start with the dough. Do you want to mix it or roll it out?<p class=message>I think I'll let you handle the rolling, since that's your specialty.<p class="message sent">No problem, but you have to promise me you'll wear an apron. Flour stains are not a fashion statement.<p class=message>Haha, duly noted. How about I make us some coffee while we work?<p class="message sent">Now you're speaking my language. Homemade pastries and fresh coffee â€“ it's a match made in heaven.<p class=message>Agreed! And if this new recipe turns out to be a hit, we can call it Seoulful Sweets!<p class="message sent">Nice one! I like how you're thinking. Let's get to work and make this recipe a success.<p class=message>Yes, let's do it! It's been great working with you, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=abb1017b-c1cc-4e83-a601-50be1970f7f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
