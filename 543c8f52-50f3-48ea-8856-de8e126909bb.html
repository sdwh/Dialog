What brings you to these woods?<p class="message sent">Salutations, elf archer! I'm on a quest to find a missing magician. Have you seen anyone suspicious around here?<p class=message>Hmm... I've noticed some odd activity lately, but nothing too out of the ordinary. What makes you think a magician is involved?<p class="message sent">Well, witnesses reported seeing sparks shooting from their hands before they disappeared. It's the mark of a magic user. I'm trying to track them down and hopefully find some answers.<p class=message>I see. Well, as an archer, I have a pretty good vantage point from up here. Let me take a look around and see if I can spot anything.<p class="message sent">That would be great! I'll keep searching on the ground.<p class=message>Wait, I think I see something in the distance. It looks like a figure dressed in robes. Could that be the magician you're looking for?<p class="message sent">Let's move out! We can't let them get away again.<p class=message>Right behind you, warrior!<p class="message sent">(panting) We've been following this trail for hours. Are we getting close?<p class=message>(grinning) As a matter of fact, yes. Look over there!<p class="message sent">(squinting) I don't see anything...oh! (excited) There he is! That's the magician we're looking for.<p class=message>(nodding) And he's carrying a mysterious object. We need to act fast before he casts another spell or disappears again.<p class="message sent">(readying weapon) I'm with you. Let's do this!<p class=message>(loosing arrow) Bullseye!<p class="message sent">(charging with weapon) Take that!<p class=message>(triumphant) Success! We make quite the team, don't we?<p class="message sent">(grinning) Absolutely. Who knows what other adventures await us in the future?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=543be9b5-07d8-48be-b184-0937b332a467.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
