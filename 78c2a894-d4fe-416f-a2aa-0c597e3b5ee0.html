Did I miss something good?<p class=message>Yes, it was hilarious. There was this scene where Dwight came in dressed as a Sith Lord.<p class="message sent">(laughs) You're kidding me! That sounds ridiculous.<p class=message>It was! But you know what's more ridiculous? These spreadsheets we're working on.<p class="message sent">(sighs) Tell me about it. I never thought I'd be spending my day staring at numbers and formulas.<p class=message>Yeah, but at least we're not stuck working in a beet farm like Dwight.<p class="message sent">(smirks) I'd rather do that than deal with some of our difficult clients.<p class=message>That's true. Speaking of clients, did you hear about that one who sent us a whole box of chocolates as a thank you gift?<p class="message sent">(excitedly) No way! I didn't know we had clients that generous.<p class=message>(laughs) Yeah, it almost makes up for the ones who send angry emails every other day.<p class="message sent">(jokes) Maybe we should start a new tradition and send chocolates with every email.<p class=message>(laughs) I don't think management would appreciate that, but it's a nice thought.<p class="message sent">(grins) Hey, we might get some happy clients out of it.<p class=message>(smiling) You never know. But for now, let's get back to these spreadsheets.<p class="message sent">(nods) Right. I'll grab some more coffee, and we'll tackle this together. Teamwork, right?<p class=message>(smiling) Absolutely.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=78bdb126-eab4-444d-8dae-1eae569ff0ce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
