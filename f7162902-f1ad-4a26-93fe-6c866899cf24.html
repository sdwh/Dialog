I'm afraid I haven't. What is it?<p class=message>It's a rice porridge usually served in Asian countries. I love it!<p class="message sent">Really? What's so great about it?<p class=message>Well, it's a warm, comforting bowl of goodness. It's also customizable, you can add toppings like pork floss, century egg or even peanuts!<p class="message sent">Sounds yummy! Do you have a go-to place for Congee?<p class=message>Yes, I usually go to a nearby Chinese restaurant. But I've also tried making it myself. It's surprisingly easy!<p class="message sent">That's impressive! Do you have any tips on how to make it?<p class=message>Sure! First, you need to rinse the rice several times until the water runs clear. Then, add more water and cook the rice until it becomes porridge-like. Don't forget to stir it every once in a while.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recipe! I can't wait to try it myself. Do you eat Congee for breakfast or dinner?<p class=message>You can have it for both! In fact, it's a popular breakfast item. But I prefer it for dinner, especially on a cold, rainy day.<p class="message sent">I see. I'll have to give it a try. Thanks for introducing me to Congee!<p class=message>You're welcome! Let me know how it turns out. Maybe we can have a Congee party!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f7115e7b-33e5-46c0-b966-eef53699302e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
