Are you ready for your flight today?<p class="message sent">Hi, I am. I'm just going through the security check. It's always a little nerve-wracking, but I'm glad they have these procedures in place.<p class=message>Absolutely. Safety is our top priority. How is the process going so far?<p class="message sent">It's going smoothly as always. I'm just taking off my shoes and belt, and putting everything through the scanner.<p class=message>Great to hear that. Can I remind you to put all your liquids in a clear plastic bag, and make sure it's less than 100 milliliters each?<p class="message sent">Oh, of course! Thank you for reminding me. It's been a while since I last flew.<p class=message>No worries. We want to make sure everything goes smoothly. Do you have any electronics in your carry-on?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have my phone, tablet, and headphones.<p class=message>Alright, you can keep those in your bag. Please remember to switch them off for takeoff and landing.<p class="message sent">Got it. Is there anything else I should be aware of?<p class=message>Not really. Just make sure you have your boarding pass and ID ready, and follow the instructions of the security personnel. We'll be boarding soon, so you might want to grab a quick bite or visit the restroom before we head off.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the heads-up. I'll do that now. Safe travels to all of us!<p class=message>Indeed. We'll try to make it as smooth and pleasant as possible. Enjoy your flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=91ca2675-804d-4472-a2d1-86ff7f72ac2e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
