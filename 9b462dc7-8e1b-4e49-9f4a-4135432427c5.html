What delicious creations do you have planned for our guests today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Manager A! Today we will be serving some classic Spanish dishes like paella and tortilla espa√±ola, but with a modern twist.<p class=message>Sounds exciting! I'm sure our guests will be thrilled to try them.<p class="message sent">Yes, I've also prepared some brand new recipes that I've been experimenting with, like a smoked salmon and avocado salad with a tangy dressing.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a perfect summer dish! What about dessert?<p class="message sent">I've got a few options, but I'm leaning towards a traditional Spanish flan with caramel sauce.<p class=message>Yum, I love flan! By the way, did you hear that we've got a famous celebrity staying with us this week?<p class="message sent">Really? Who is it?<p class=message>I can't say, but let's just say he's known for his love of fine dining.<p class="message sent">Well, that certainly raises the stakes! We'll have to make sure every dish is up to par.<p class=message>Absolutely. Our reputation is on the line!<p class="message sent">Don't worry, Manager A, I'll make sure each dish is cooked to perfection.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear, Chef B!
