Should be ready in a few minutes.<p class=message>Great, let's make sure it's not too rare though. Don't want any customers complaining.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I've been doing this for years. Trust me, it'll be perfect.<p class=message>Speaking of customers, have you ever had anyone request something weird for their meat?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, once someone asked for a blue steak. I had to explain that we couldn't serve raw meat like that.<p class=message>That's definitely strange. But, at least they're adventurous with their food choices.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, it's always fun to see what people come up with.<p class=message>You know, I heard that there's a restaurant in Seoul that serves edible gold in their sushi.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a bit much if you ask me. But, to each their own I guess.<p class=message>Yeah, I don't think I'll ever understand the appeal of eating gold.<p class="message sent">Hey, as long as it tastes good and doesn't make you sick, it's all good.<p class=message>Fair enough. Hey, can you pass me the veggies? I think they're ready for the wok.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, let me just toss them in.<p class=message>Smells amazing. You really have a talent for cooking, B.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. It's all about technique and using the right ingredients.<p class=message>Well, you've definitely got it down. Time to serve up these dishes and make some hungry customers happy.<p class="message sent">Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=535571f5-4009-4c30-8df8-9ed214835215.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
