I'm so excited to bake cookies with you today.<p class="message sent">Me too, Mom! What kind of cookies are we making?<p class=message>We're making chocolate chip cookies, just like we always do. It's a classic recipe!<p class="message sent">Yum! Can I help with mixing the ingredients?<p class=message>Of course! Here, you can help me measure out the flour.<p class="message sent">This is a lot of flour! Do we really need all of it?<p class=message>Yes, we do. Baking is all about precision. We have to follow the recipe exactly.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. What's next?<p class=message>Now we add the chocolate chips. You can pour them into the mixing bowl.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love chocolate chips! Can I have one to taste?<p class=message>Sure, go ahead. Just one, though. We need them all for the cookies!<p class="message sent">Mmm, delicious. I can't wait to eat the cookies when they're done.<p class=message>Me too! Okay, now we're ready to mix everything together. Do you want to help with that?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! I want to use the electric mixer.<p class=message>Alright, but be careful. It can be tricky to use.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, Mom. I've seen you do it before.<p class=message>Haha, okay. Just let me know if you need any help.<p class="message sent">I think I've got it. Wow, this is fun! Look at all the dough flying around!<p class=message>Haha, you're doing great. Now we just have to scoop the dough onto the baking sheet.<p class="message sent">Can I do it in different shapes?<p class=message>Sure, why not? We can have some round cookies and some square ones.<p class="message sent">This is so cool! I love baking with you, Mom.<p class=message>I love it too, sweetie. And you're doing such a good job.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Mom. I can't wait to share these cookies with our family and friends.<p class=message>Me neither. They're going to be the best chocolate chip cookies ever!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=90a86098-7ce5-47b0-a016-ed118419216b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
