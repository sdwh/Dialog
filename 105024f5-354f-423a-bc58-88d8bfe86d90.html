How's the coffee business today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. It's been a busy morning so far. What brings you in today?<p class=message>I need your expertise in coffee selection for my new dessert. I'm thinking of a chocolate cake with espresso cream filling.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious! I have just the beans you need. How about we pair it with a medium roast?<p class=message>Perfect! Now, could you pass me the whipping cream while I start baking the cake?<p class="message sent">Of course. Do you need any help with the recipe?<p class=message>I've got it covered, but thanks for offering. By the way, did you know the first coffee plant was discovered in Ethiopia?<p class="message sent">Really? I had no idea. Did you know that the world's most expensive coffee is made from animal feces?<p class=message>Ew, no way! That's crazy. So, B, what's the secret for making the perfect latte art?<p class="message sent">Practice and consistency. I can show you some tricks if you'd like.<p class=message>Awesome! Let's make an espresso and decorate it with a cute heart.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. While we're at it, did you hear about the coffee shop that employs only dogs?<p class=message>No, tell me more!<p class="message sent">It's in South Korea, and every order comes with a cute paw print on the foam.<p class=message>That's amazing! Speaking of which, I think these cupcakes with coffee frosting are ready for the oven.<p class="message sent">They smell delicious. Do you mind sharing the recipe with me?<p class=message>Not at all. It's a family secret, but since you're such a great coffee expert, I'll make an exception.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. You're the best. And speaking of family secrets, did you know that the original Frappuccino recipe was created by a bartender in California?<p class=message>Interesting! I guess coffee is not just for mornings anymore.<p class="message sent">Definitely not. Speaking of which, would you like an iced coffee to cool down?<p class=message>Yes, please. And could you add some caramel syrup to it?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Here's your ice-cold caramel macchiato.<p class=message>Mmm, this hits the spot. Thank you so much, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A.
