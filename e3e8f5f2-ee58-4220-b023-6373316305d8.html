I have used Bootstrap before, but not so much of MVC 5.<p class=message>That's fine. MVC 5 provides us with a lot of tools and features that make it easier for us to build dynamic web applications.<p class="message sent">I see. I heard that Bootstrap has its own set of components and styles that make it easy for us to design a responsive and visually appealing website.<p class=message>Yes, that's right. With Bootstrap, we don't have to worry too much about CSS styling and can focus more on the functionality of the website.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. I'm excited to get started on this project.<p class=message>Me too. It's going to be a fun challenge to combine these two tools and create something that the company will find useful.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm thinking of using Entity Framework as well for the back-end data management.<p class=message>That's a good idea. We can use it to connect to the database and set up models and controllers.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And with MVC 5, we can create views to display the data in a user-friendly manner.<p class=message>I like your approach. We should definitely discuss this more during the brainstorming session.<p class="message sent">For sure. We can also use Git for version control and Azure for deployment.<p class=message>Sounds great! Let's get started on this and create the best internal website system the company has ever seen.<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it! It's going to be an exciting and challenging journey.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e3e188d3-5bd1-4dc0-a680-2693730f94fc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
