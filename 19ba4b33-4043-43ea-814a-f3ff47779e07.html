Speaking of help, have you heard of the latest office gossip?<p class="message sent">(laughs) No, I haven't. Do tell!<p class=message>Apparently, someone is leaving sticky notes with motivational quotes all over the office. It's been quite entertaining reading them.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's hilarious! I hope they keep it up. Maybe it's like a secret Santa early Christmas present.<p class=message>(smiling) Who knows? It's definitely something to look forward to every morning. But, let's get back to work now.
