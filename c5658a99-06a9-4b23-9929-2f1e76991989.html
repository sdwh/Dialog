Are you a student here?<p class="message sent">Yes, I am. Nice to meet you.<p class=message>Nice to meet you too. I'm a marketing officer here. Are you interested in learning more about our school's enrollment plan?<p class="message sent">Yes, please. I'm curious about how the school attracts new students.<p class=message>Well, we have various ways to do that. We organize campus tours, participate in education fairs, promote our academic programs, and more. Do you have any ideas?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have an idea for promoting the school.<p class=message>Really? That's great. What's your idea?<p class="message sent">I think the school can create a promotional video that showcases the campus life and activities that students can enjoy here.<p class=message>That's a fantastic idea! We have a media team that can help us with that. It would be great to have students involved in creating the video too.<p class="message sent">Yes, that will make it more authentic and relatable to potential students.<p class=message>I agree. We can also share the video on social media platforms.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. Social media is an effective way to reach out to younger generations.<p class=message>Definitely. We can also offer referral incentives to current students who successfully bring in new students.<p class="message sent">That's a good way to encourage word of mouth marketing.<p class=message>Yes, it is. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class="message sent">I think the school can also host community events that involve students and showcase their talents.<p class=message>Another great idea! We can definitely use our auditorium for that.<p class="message sent">Thank you! I'm glad you like my ideas.<p class=message>Thank you for sharing them with me. I'll take note of them and present them to the enrollment team.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c558e31e-a07a-4423-902f-c6b3861d0b4a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
