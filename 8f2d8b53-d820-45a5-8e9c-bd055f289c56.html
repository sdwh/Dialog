It's a framework for information security management, right?<p class=message>Exactly! And I'm thinking about getting certified in it. Do you know any good study resources?<p class="message sent">Well, there are some great books out there, but I personally prefer taking practice exams online.<p class=message>Ah, that's a good idea. Do you have any recommendations for sites that offer them?<p class="message sent">I've been using Exam-Labs and they seem pretty reliable.<p class=message>Okay, I'll definitely check it out. What do you think are the benefits of being certified in ISO 27001?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, it shows that you have a comprehensive understanding of information security management. Plus, it can open up new job opportunities and make you more competitive in the industry.<p class=message>That's true. I'm just worried about the exam itself. Have you heard anything about how difficult it is?<p class="message sent">I've heard mixed reviews. Some people say it's challenging, but others say that it's relatively straightforward if you study well.<p class=message>Hmm, well I guess I'll just have to be really prepared. Thanks for the advice, B!<p class="message sent">No problem! I'm thinking of getting certified too, so maybe we can study together.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We could make flashcards and quiz each other.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. And hey, if we both get certified, we can celebrate with some drinks!<p class=message>Ha ha, I like the way you think. We'll definitely have to do that.<p class="message sent">For sure. And who knows? Maybe we'll become information security gurus and start our own consulting firm.<p class=message>Now you're really dreaming big, B. But hey, anything is possible!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8f2798dc-2a45-405c-a24e-c8d1701a36c9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
