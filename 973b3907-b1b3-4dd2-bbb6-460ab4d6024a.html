How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">I'm feeling great, thank you. How about you, A?<p class=message>I'm doing well too. Ready for another day of learning?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. What's on the agenda for today?<p class=message>We'll be talking about the concept of supply and demand in economics.<p class="message sent">Interesting. I've heard about that before. So, why do prices go up or down?<p class=message>That's exactly what we'll be discussing. Let's start with an example. Imagine there's a sudden increase in demand for a certain product, like hand sanitizers.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. And since supply is limited, the price goes up.<p class=message>Exactly. On the other hand, if there's a decrease in demand, the price drops. It's all about balance.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. I'll have to keep that in mind when I go shopping. Speaking of shopping, have you ever heard of the store that only sells left shoes?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Why do they only sell left shoes?<p class="message sent">Because they have no right to sell them! (laughs)<p class=message>(laughs) Very clever, B. You always have a joke up your sleeve!<p class="message sent">I try my best to keep the mood light. Anyway, back to the lesson. This is really fascinating stuff.<p class=message>I'm glad you think so. It's important to understand how the economy works, especially in today's world.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Thank you for being such a great teacher, A. I feel like I'm really learning a lot.<p class=message>You're welcome, B. It's a pleasure to have you in my class. Let's continue with the lesson and see where it takes us.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9739e480-ef72-4ff9-9c19-84c55544a939.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
