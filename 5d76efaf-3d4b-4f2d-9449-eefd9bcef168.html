Would you like something sharp or mild?<p class=message>I think I prefer something mild.<p class="message sent">In that case, I highly recommend our brie cheese. It's soft and creamy with a subtle nutty flavor.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! And what main course would you recommend pairing it with?<p class="message sent">Our grilled chicken with honey mustard glaze is a popular choice. It's a perfect balance of sweet and savory.<p class=message>Hmm, that does sound like a great combination. But I'm also eyeing the spaghetti carbonara. Would that go well with the brie?<p class="message sent">Yes, it would! The creaminess of the brie would complement the richness of the carbonara sauce quite nicely.<p class=message>Awesome, I think I'll go with that combo then! Thanks for your help.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?<p class=message>Actually, since you're so knowledgeable about the menu, could you recommend a good drink to go with my meal?<p class="message sent">Of course! If you're looking for something light and refreshing, our house-made lemonade is a popular choice. But if you'd like something a bit stronger, I recommend our signature gin and tonic.<p class=message>Hmm, decisions decisions... I think I'll go with the lemonade for now. But thank you for the suggestion!<p class="message sent">My pleasure. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5d766dc7-0b25-44ce-a12a-af563d82d0c2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
