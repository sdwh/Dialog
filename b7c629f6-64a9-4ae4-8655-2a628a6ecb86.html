I'm trying to figure out how to integrate it with the backend systems.<p class=message>yeah, that can be a tricky part. Let me know if you need any help.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate it. Have you seen the new data we have on marine wildlife in the Pacific?<p class=message>No, not yet. What did you find?<p class="message sent">Well, it looks like the population of blue whales has increased significantly in the last decade.<p class=message>Wow, that's definitely good news. Did you update the database with the latest numbers?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. We should have it ready for the next release.<p class=message>Great! Speaking of releases, what's the ETA for the upcoming version?<p class="message sent">We're shooting for next month. There's still a lot of work to be done, but we're making progress.<p class=message>Sounds like we're on track then. I'm excited to see how the site will look.<p class="message sent">Me too. Do you have any ideas for the user interface?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of incorporating some interactive maps to show where different species can be found.<p class="message sent">That's a cool idea. We could also include some educational content for users who are interested in learning more about marine life.<p class=message>Yes, definitely. We want the site to be both informative and engaging.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And with your database skills and my backend expertise, we can make it happen.<p class=message>Teamwork makes the dream work!<p class="message sent">You got that right. Let's keep pushing forward and make this project a success.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b7c0745f-2027-49e5-9146-de3f0872890b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
