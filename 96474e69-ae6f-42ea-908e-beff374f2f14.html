I'm a bit lost, can you help me with my connecting flight?<p class="message sent">Of course! Where are you flying from and where is your final destination?<p class=message>I'm flying from Tokyo to New York, but I have a layover in Los Angeles.<p class="message sent">Alright, let me check your itinerary. You'll arrive in Terminal B and you have to head to Terminal C for your connecting flight. You have around 2 hours and 30 minutes, so you have plenty of time to make it.<p class=message>Great, thanks for letting me know. I hope I won't get lost in LAX, it's such a big airport!<p class="message sent">Don't worry, you won't. LAX is well-organized and there are plenty of signs to guide you. Plus, we'll give you a map with all the directions and some cool tips on where to eat or shop!<p class=message>Sounds awesome! I'm excited for my layover now. Do you have any recommendations for a good burger?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! My personal favorite is the Umami Burger in Terminal C. They have some of the juiciest burgers ever.<p class=message>Yum, that definitely sounds delicious. I'll have to try that out. Thanks for your help and for the tip, you've made my layover so much easier and enjoyable!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, happy to help. Have a great trip and safe travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=96442732-bbb5-4bc6-a256-8f8012f01abd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
