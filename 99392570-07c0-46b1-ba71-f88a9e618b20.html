It's a standard for information security management systems, right?<p class=message>That's right! And within that standard, there are three main pillars: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.<p class="message sent">Ah, gotcha. So, what specifically do you want to talk about?<p class=message>Let's start with confidentiality. What comes to mind when you think of that?<p class="message sent">Well, keeping information private, I suppose. Making sure it doesn't get into the wrong hands.<p class=message>Exactly! And ISO 27001 provides guidelines for specifically how to do that, like having access controls and encryption methods.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. So it's not just about not telling secrets, it's about actively protecting information.<p class=message>Yup, you got it. And it's important for things like financial information or personal data.<p class="message sent">Yeah, definitely. It sucks when your credit card gets stolen or your social security number gets leaked.<p class=message>Tell me about it. But on a lighter note, have you seen any good movies lately?<p class="message sent">Not really, to be honest. You?<p class=message>Yeah, I saw a great one the other day. It's called Parasite, it's a Korean film.<p class="message sent">Oh yeah! I heard that won a bunch of awards.<p class=message>It did! And for good reason. It's really well made and has a lot of interesting commentary on social class.<p class="message sent">Nice, I'll have to watch it. Speaking of social class, do you think ISO 27001 is more important for certain industries than others?<p class=message>Hmm, that's a good question. I think any industry that handles sensitive information, like healthcare or finance, would prioritize it more.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. It's just like how some companies might put more emphasis on say, eco-friendliness or workplace diversity.<p class=message>Exactly! Well said. Do you have any other questions about ISO 27001?<p class="message sent">Not at the moment, I think I've got a good grasp on it. Thanks for explaining it to me!<p class=message>No problem, always happy to chat about information security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=99304cda-9afd-49f5-b57d-697a9a452718.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
