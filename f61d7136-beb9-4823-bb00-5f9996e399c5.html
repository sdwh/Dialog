I'm so excited!<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm thrilled to be working with you too. So tell me, what kind of puzzles do you like?<p class=message>Hmm, I really enjoy riddles and logic puzzles. Oh, and I also love using math to solve puzzles.<p class="message sent">That's perfect! We have several riddles and logic puzzles in the game, and we're trying to incorporate some math puzzles too. If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know!<p class=message>That sounds awesome! I can't wait to try the game. By the way, what's the storyline of the game?<p class="message sent">The game is about a detective who's trying to solve a mystery. The player acts as the detective, and they have to complete different puzzles and challenges to progress further in the game.<p class=message>That sounds so exciting! Is there any particular challenge that you think players will find most difficult?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I'd say the logic puzzles are the most challenging, but we've made sure that they're all solvable. We don't want players to get frustrated and give up.<p class=message>That's really considerate of you. I'm sure players will appreciate it. Oh, and what's the name of the game?<p class="message sent">We're still working on that, but we're thinking of calling it "The Mystery of the Missing Diamond." What do you think?<p class=message>Ooh, that sounds so intriguing! I love it. When will the game be released?<p class="message sent">We're aiming to release it next month, but it all depends on how quickly we can finish the final touches.<p class=message>I'm counting down the days! Thanks for chatting with me, B. You've got me even more excited for the game now.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, A. It was great to talk to you about it. Have a good day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f61cf9a6-c5cb-4835-b24c-8892dd27f1fb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
