Nice to meet you, B, the sysadmin.<p class="message sent">Hey there, A. It's great to meet you too! So what's your plan to strengthen our network security?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking we can start by implementing a two-factor authentication system for all employees accessing our sensitive data.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a solid plan. But how about adding a firewall to restrict unauthorized access?<p class=message>Absolutely. We can also set up a Network Intrusion Detection System to notify us of any suspicious activity on our network.<p class="message sent">Nice! And we should make sure to update all our software and firmware regularly to patch up any vulnerabilities.<p class=message>Agreed. And, of course, we need to train all our employees to be aware of phishing scams and to use strong passwords.<p class="message sent">Indeed. We should also prepare a disaster recovery plan for any potential data breaches.<p class=message>Good point. It's always better to be proactive than reactive. But let's not forget to conduct regular security audits to ensure our measures are still effective.<p class="message sent">That's right. We should benchmark ourselves against industry standards and continuously improve our security measures.<p class=message>Well, it seems like we have a comprehensive plan in place now. Thanks for the great discussion, B!<p class="message sent">Thank you too, A. Let's work together to keep our network safe and secure!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7547c5f1-2f1d-4287-9cbc-da5e0fb4fdc5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
