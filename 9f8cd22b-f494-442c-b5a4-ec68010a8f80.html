The only people around are us, and the occasional stray cat.<p class=message>Well, I guess that's good news for us, no need to worry about any disturbances.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Although, I wouldn't mind if something exciting happened. It's been a slow day.<p class=message>Careful what you wish for, B. You never know what could happen around here.<p class="message sent">Point taken. But, a part of me is hoping we get to chase down some thief or something.<p class=message>(laughs) You know, sometimes I think you joined the force just for the adrenaline rush.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Maybe, but it doesn't hurt to keep things interesting.<p class=message>Look over there, a new donut shop just opened up. What do you say we take a break and grab a donut break?<p class="message sent">(looks at his watch) Sure, I could use a sugar rush right about now.<p class=message>Great. But let's not tell our boss, he might think we're slacking off.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Good idea. Our secret little donut run.<p class=message>Hey, at least it'll give us the energy we need to protect and serve.<p class="message sent">You got it. And who knows, maybe we'll even have an interesting story to tell by the end of the day.<p class=message>(smiling) You're always on the lookout for adventure, B.<p class="message sent">(grinning) That's why they call me the fearless one.<p class=message>(laughs) Let's just hope we come back with all the donuts in one piece.<p class="message sent">(jokingly) If we don't, we'll just have to chase down the thief who stole them.<p class=message>(laughs) Always thinking, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9f8bf885-48fb-4992-9b8b-3c12fbbd680e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
