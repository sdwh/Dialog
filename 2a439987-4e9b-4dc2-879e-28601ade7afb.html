It's one of my favorite dishes!<p class=message>Oh really? I've never had it before. What does it taste like?<p class="message sent">It's a little bit sweet, sour, and savory all at once. Plus, it has peanuts and vegetables to add crunch.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of flavors, but in a good way. What kind of noodles do they use?<p class="message sent">Thin rice noodles, and they're stir-fried with eggs, chicken, or shrimp. Sometimes they add tofu or bean sprouts too.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds delicious! Do you know any good places to get Pad Thai around here?<p class="message sent">There's a Thai restaurant on Main Street that serves great Pad Thai. Or we could try making it ourselves at home!<p class=message>Ooh, I'm not sure if I'm up for the challenge of making it myself. But I'm definitely down to try it at the restaurant. Maybe we can go this weekend?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Just be warned, it's pretty spicy, but you can ask for it to be made mild if you can't handle the heat.<p class=message>Challenge accepted! I can handle a little spice. Thanks for the heads up. I'm excited to finally try Pad Thai and see what all the fuss is about.<p class="message sent">You won't be disappointed. Pad Thai is always a crowd pleaser. And who knows, maybe we'll be inspired to try making it ourselves after all!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a4227f8-2479-45ad-b660-e9ff67e0a075.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
