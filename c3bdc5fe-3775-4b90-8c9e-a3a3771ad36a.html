I'm excited to see you here at the marketing expo. What kind of business do you have?<p class="message sent">Hi! I sell handmade accessories like jewelry and hair clips. It's a small business, but it's important to me.<p class=message>That's great! Have you thought about using social media to promote your products?<p class="message sent">I've tried a little bit, but I'm not very experienced with it. Do you have any tips?<p class=message>Sure, I can definitely help you out. First, it's important to have eye-catching photos. Then, engage with your followers by posting regularly and responding to their comments.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. I've seen some influencers doing that. Do you have any suggestions for collaborating with them?<p class=message>Yes, influencer marketing can be a great way to get your products seen by more people. Look for influencers whose brand aligns with yours and reach out to them with a proposal.<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds like something I can try. How much does it usually cost to work with an influencer?<p class=message>It depends on their level of influence and reach, but it can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. However, there are also some micro-influencers who may charge less.<p class="message sent">Thank you for the advice. I'll definitely look more into it. How can I contact you if I have further questions?<p class=message>You can always email me or connect with me on LinkedIn. I'm happy to help out small businesses like yours!<p class="message sent">That's so kind of you. Thank you for your time and expertise. It was nice meeting you.<p class=message>Likewise, good luck with your business! Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c3bcd9d6-1b48-4cb3-943e-78136fc7da46.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
