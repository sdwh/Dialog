Do you have any previous experience in room service?<p class=message>Yes, I used to work for a hotel in my hometown and I was in charge of the room service department for two years.<p class="message sent">Great! We need someone who can handle guests' needs and communicate effectively. Can you tell me how you handled difficult guests in the past?<p class=message>I remember there was this one time when a guest requested a very specific dish that was not on our menu. I took the time to understand their needs and talked to the chef to see if we could make a similar dish. Ultimately, the guest was satisfied and even left a positive review on our website.<p class="message sent">That's impressive! How do you prioritize your tasks and make sure everything is delivered on time?<p class=message>Basically, I would start with the urgent orders first and then move on to the less pressing ones. Also, I try to organize my route in a way that maximizes efficiency so that I can deliver everything on time.<p class="message sent">I see. Can you tell me a little about your personal style when interacting with guests?<p class=message>I always try to be polite, friendly and professional. I believe good service comes from a genuine desire to help satisfy a guest's needs.<p class="message sent">Well, based on what you've told me, I believe you have the necessary skills and experience for this job. Do you have any questions for me?<p class=message>Yes, what kind of training and support can I expect if I am hired for the job?<p class="message sent">We provide comprehensive training on our company's policies, procedures and customer service standards. In addition, you'll be working with a team of experienced professionals who will guide you every step of the way.<p class=message>That sounds great! I'm excited about the opportunity to join your team and provide excellent service to your guests.<p class="message sent">Wonderful! We'll contact you soon with details about the next steps in the hiring process.<p class=message>Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Have a great day!<p class="message sent">You're welcome and good luck!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=32996734-dcec-448c-b507-6a06fa969577.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
