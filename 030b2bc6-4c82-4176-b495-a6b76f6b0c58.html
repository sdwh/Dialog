What is it?<p class="message received message-content">It's a Spanish rice dish with a lot of flavor. It's like the Spanish version of fried rice.<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds delicious! What's in it?<p class="message received message-content">Oh boy! There's rice, saffron, chicken, shellfish, and sometimes even rabbit meat.<p class="message sent message-content">Wow, that sounds fancy. Do you know how to make it?<p class="message received message-content">I wish I did! It seems like a complicated dish to cook.<p class="message sent message-content">Yeah, it does. Is there a special way to eat it?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, traditionally, you eat it right out of the pan with a wooden spoon.<p class="message sent message-content">That's unique. Have you had it before?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, I had it on vacation in Spain. It was amazing! I could have eaten the whole pan.<p class="message sent message-content">I'm jealous! I need to try it sometime.<p class="message received message-content">You definitely should! It's one of those dishes that will transport you to another place.<p class="message sent message-content">Speaking of travel, when we can travel again, we should plan a trip to Spain to have some authentic Paella.<p class="message received message-content">Deal! And we'll eat it with a wooden spoon, just like the locals.<p class="message sent message-content">Haha, sounds like a plan. Until then, let's find a good Spanish restaurant and indulge in some Paella.<p class="message received message-content">Yes, let's do that. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=03094347-7b2f-42f9-96dd-11370b389254.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
