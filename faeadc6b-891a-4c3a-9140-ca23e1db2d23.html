Looks like you're working hard behind the bar.<p class="message sent">Hey, how are you? Yes, it's a busy night tonight. What can I get you?<p class=message>Hmm...how about something special to Switzerland? Maybe you can recommend a famous Swiss alcohol?<p class="message sent">Definitely! How about Absinthe? It's a green-colored spirit that's famous in Switzerland.<p class=message>Oh, I've heard about that one! Isn't it the one that's supposed to be very strong and hallucinogenic?<p class="message sent">Well, it used to be. But now it's made with much lower levels of thujone, a key ingredient that's supposed to have those effects. Would you like me to mix you one?<p class=message>Sure, that sounds exciting! What's the process like?<p class="message sent">First, you need to place a sugar cube on top of a slotted spoon that's resting on an Absinthe glass. Then, you slowly pour Absinthe over the sugar and light a fire to the sugar. Once the sugar is melted, you add an equal amount of cold water to the glass.<p class=message>Wow, that's quite the process! Sounds like a drink that requires patience.<p class="message sent">It definitely does. But it's worth it in the end. There's something about Absinthe that has this elusive quality to it. It's like nothing else out there.<p class=message>Sounds like a drink with a lot of character. I'm excited to try it!<p class="message sent">Great! Let me get started on it. Do you have any other questions about Absinthe?<p class=message>Not really, just excited to experience it for myself. Maybe I'll become an Absinthe aficionado after this!<p class="message sent">Hey, anything is possible! It's always fun to try new things and discover what you like.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fae62581-359b-48f5-b436-7bf83f57da42.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
