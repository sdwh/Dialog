Nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hi A, I'm B, your guide for the day. Welcome to Tsukiji Fish Market! Are you excited to explore?<p class=message>Yes, I'm thrilled! I've heard so much about this place and the variety of seafood available here.<p class="message sent">Great! Let's start with some tips on how to choose the best seafood. Look for clear eyes and bright colors, and make sure it smells fresh.<p class=message>That's helpful! I've always wondered how to tell if the fish is fresh or not.<p class="message sent">And don't forget to check the gills - they should be bright red or pink. That means the fish is well-oxygenated and fresh.<p class=message>Got it. Looks like I'll be using my senses a lot today. What do you recommend we try first?<p class="message sent">We have some amazing tuna here, and the uni (sea urchin) is a must-try. And of course, you can't leave without trying some sushi.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! I can't wait to try them all.<p class="message sent">Let's head to some of the fish stalls and get started. Oh, and make sure to watch out for the speeding carts around here!<p class=message>Will do! This place is bustling with activity, I'm loving it.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's always lively around here. That's what makes it such a special place.<p class=message>I can see why. Oh wow, look at those giant crabs! I've never seen anything like them before.<p class="message sent">Those are the king crabs, a delicacy in Japan. Want to take a closer look?<p class=message>Yes, definitely. This is such an eye-opening experience. I'm learning so much about the different types of seafood available here.<p class="message sent">That's the beauty of the Tsukiji Fish Market. It's not just a marketplace, it's a cultural experience too.<p class=message>I completely agree. This has been an amazing day, I know I'll never forget it.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you enjoyed it, A. It was great to have you here with me today.<p class=message>Thank you so much for showing me around. I can't wait to come back here with my family and share this experience with them.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bb488949-7e19-411c-9a3c-831411ce8c27.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
