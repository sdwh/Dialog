What's your flight number and destination?<p class=message>My flight number is AC205 and I'm headed to Vancouver.<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. You're flying with Air Canada and your departure time is at 2:30 PM. Have you checked in online yet?<p class=message>Yes, I have. But I still wanted to confirm my seat assignment.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. It looks like you've been assigned a window seat in row 14.<p class=message>Perfect! That's exactly what I wanted. Is there any chance my flight might be delayed?<p class="message sent">There shouldn't be any issues reported at the moment, but it's always best to check the information board for any updates.<p class=message>Thanks for the heads up. Will there be any inflight entertainment available?<p class="message sent">Yes, you'll have access to a variety of movies and TV shows on your personal screen.<p class=message>That's great news! And what about the food options?<p class="message sent">You'll have a choice between a vegetarian wrap or a chicken sandwich, both served with a side salad.<p class=message>Yum! I think I'll go with the chicken sandwich. Will I be able to purchase any snacks on board as well?<p class="message sent">Definitely! There will be a selection of snacks and drinks available for purchase throughout the flight.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Oh, and one last thing - what's the maximum weight for carry-on luggage?<p class="message sent">Your carry-on bag must not exceed 22lbs and should fit comfortably in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of you.<p class=message>Got it. Thank you so much for all your help, B. You've been a great help!<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, A. Have a safe and enjoyable flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=adc883a2-41b4-4a1a-be2f-a8d1e53a4119.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
