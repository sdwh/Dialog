How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning A! I'm feeling great, thank you. I'm excited for today's yoga class.<p class=message>That's wonderful to hear! Today we'll be focusing on balance and flexibility. Have you been practicing your stretches at home?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. But there are some positions that are still a bit challenging.<p class=message>That's completely normal. Remember, progress is made by taking small, consistent steps.<p class="message sent">That's true. Speaking of progress, what do you think is the most challenging pose for most people?<p class=message>In my experience, it's definitely the headstand or the crow pose. But don't worry, we'll work our way up to those.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Are there any modifications that can help me in the meantime?<p class=message>Absolutely. We can use blocks or straps to make certain poses more accessible.<p class="message sent">I appreciate that. By the way, I heard that you have a very cute dog. What kind of breed is he?<p class=message>Yes, I have a French bulldog named Louie. He's a little ball of energy and always keeps me on my toes!<p class="message sent">Aww, he sounds adorable. I have a cat myself, but I'm allergic to dogs unfortunately.<p class=message>Oh no! Well, Louie says he'll forgive you as long as you keep up with your yoga practice.<p class="message sent">Haha, I'll do my best! Thanks for the encouragement, A.<p class=message>No problem, B. Let's get started with the class now. Remember to breathe deeply and listen to your body. Namaste!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a8fa1c4e-4a6b-48ff-8a9b-670cf6e210d8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
