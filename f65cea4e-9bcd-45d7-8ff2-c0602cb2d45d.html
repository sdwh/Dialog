Another question, how do you stay organized in your role?<p class="message sent">I use a combination of technology and old-fashioned pen and paper. I write out my to-do list and schedule in a planner and use apps like Trello to manage project tasks.<p class=message>Very practical, thanks for sharing. Shifting gears here, what's the biggest challenge you've faced in your career?<p class="message sent">I would say it's been learning to balance work and personal life. It's important to prioritize self-care and make time for hobbies and loved ones. It can be a challenge, but it's worth it.<p class=message>That's a great point. Lastly, any books or podcasts you recommend for career development?<p class="message sent">Yes, I recommend "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey and the "HBR IdeaCast" podcast.
