Can you please tell me your name?<p class="message sent">Good morning, officer. My name is John.<p class=message>Hi John, we have reason to suspect that you were involved in a robbery last night. Can you please tell me where you were around the time of the incident?<p class="message sent">Well, actually officer, I was at home watching a movie with my cat.<p class=message>Your cat? Can anyone verify that you were indeed at home with your cat?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, no officer. But I swear that's where I was.<p class=message>Hmm. Well John, I see you have a tattoo of a dollar sign on your arm. Is there any significance to that?<p class="message sent">Oh that? Yeah, it's just a silly tattoo I got years ago. It doesn't mean anything.<p class=message>Interesting. Well, we'll need to do a full investigation to determine if you're telling the truth. In the meantime, can I offer you a cup of coffee?<p class="message sent">Sure, officer. That would actually be great.<p class=message>Great, hang tight for a minute while I grab you a cup.<p class="message sent">Thank you. I really appreciate it.<p class=message>So, John, what kind of cat do you have?<p class="message sent">A tabby cat. She's very cute and loves to cuddle.<p class=message>That's really sweet. I have a cat too! Do you have any other pets?<p class="message sent">No, just my cat. She's enough trouble as it is!<p class=message>(laughs) I know what you mean. Cats can definitely be a handful sometimes.<p class="message sent">Yeah, but I love her anyway. She's my little buddy.<p class=message>Alright John, thank you for your time. We'll be in touch if we have any further questions.<p class="message sent">Thank you officer.
