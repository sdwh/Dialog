Some of the errors were a bit embarrassing, to be honest.<p class=message>Tell me about it. I found an indenting mistake that made it look like a nested loop was actually a single loop.<p class="message sent">Oh man, that's the worst. I had one where I used the wrong variable, and it caused a crash when a certain condition was met.<p class=message>Yikes. Well, we have to take responsibility for our mistakes and fix them. Have you started on the repairs yet?<p class="message sent">I have. I tried using a debugger to find the root cause of the issue, but in the end, it was just a simple typo that caused the problem.<p class=message>Ah, those are the worst. But at least it's an easy fix. I've been trying to refactor some of the code to avoid similar mistakes in the future.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. It might take a bit longer, but it's definitely worth it in the long run.<p class=message>Absolutely. Plus, the better our code is, the easier it is to maintain and update in the future. Have you found any other errors or areas that need improvement?<p class="message sent">Not really. I think we caught most of the major issues during the inspection. But I'll keep an eye out just in case.<p class=message>Sounds good. Thanks for your hard work on this B. I really appreciate your attention to detail.<p class="message sent">Of course, A. We're a team, after all. We have to watch each other's backs and make sure we're producing the best code possible.<p class=message>Couldn't have said it better myself. Let's get these fixes and improvements finished up so we can move on to the next project.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Catch you later, A.<p class=message>See ya, B.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f6b9a6aa-ae8c-44c0-a03b-9995467852bc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
