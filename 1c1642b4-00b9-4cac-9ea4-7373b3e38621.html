How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">I have a bit of a legal predicament I was hoping you could assist me with.<p class=message>Of course, happy to help. What's the situation?<p class="message sent">Well, it's a bit embarrassing, but I got a traffic ticket for running a red light.<p class=message>Ah, well that's certainly a common offense. What happened exactly?<p class="message sent">I was in a rush to get to a meeting and wasn't paying attention. Next thing I knew, the light turned red and I was already in the intersection.<p class=message>Alright, I see. Let me take a look at the ticket and we can go over your options. Don't worry, it happens to the best of us.<p class="message sent">Thanks for being understanding. I was hoping I might be able to plead guilty, but maybe get a reduced fine?<p class=message>That's definitely a possibility. We might also be able to get the points on your license reduced, which could ultimately save you money down the road.<p class="message sent">That would be fantastic. I trust you to handle this for me?<p class=message>Absolutely. I'll get to work on this right away and keep you updated every step of the way. In the meantime, try not to run any more red lights!<p class="message sent">Haha, you got it. Thanks so much for your help, I really appreciate it.<p class=message>Not a problem at all. It's what I'm here for. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1c14e508-374d-4842-915f-fe41e264de55.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
