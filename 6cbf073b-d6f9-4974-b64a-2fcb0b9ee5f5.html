We've got a great show planned.<p class=message>That's great to hear. So, what inspired you to become a performer?<p class="message sent">I've loved music since I was a kid, but it wasn't until I saw a concert by my favorite band that I knew I wanted to do this.<p class=message>That's really cool. Who's your biggest musical influence?<p class="message sent">Definitely Madonna. She's been a force in the music industry for decades and I've always admired her artistry.<p class=message>I can definitely see the influence in your style. What can we expect from the concert tonight?<p class="message sent">We're going to put on a high-energy show and get the crowd dancing. We've got some new songs and some classics too, so there will be something for everyone.<p class=message>Awesome, I can't wait. Speaking of dancing, do you have any signature moves?<p class="message sent">(laughs) I do have a few, but you'll have to come to the concert to see them.<p class=message>Challenge accepted! So, what's your favorite part of performing live?<p class="message sent">The energy of the crowd. There's nothing like hearing the audience singing along and seeing them dance. It's a rush.<p class=message>I bet it is. What's the biggest challenge you've faced as a performer?<p class="message sent">Probably stage fright. It's normal to be nervous before a show, but I've had some moments where I almost let it get the best of me.<p class=message>I can imagine, but you always seem so confident on stage.<p class="message sent">(smiling) That's just part of the job. You've got to fake it till you make it, right?<p class=message>(laughs) I guess so. Well, I can't wait to see you rock the stage tonight. Break a leg!<p class="message sent">Thanks, I will.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6cbea89c-0951-4137-96ee-54d30fa0e14e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
