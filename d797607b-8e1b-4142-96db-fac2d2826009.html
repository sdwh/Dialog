Can you help me with something?<p class="message sent">Sure, what do you need help with?<p class=message>I have a patient who is taking medication for high blood pressure, but their numbers still seem to be consistently high. I'm thinking of adjusting their dosage.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. But be careful not to adjust it too much at once. Gradual adjustments are always better.<p class=message>Yeah, I definitely don't want to shock their system. What's your recommendation?<p class="message sent">Maybe start by decreasing their dosage by 5 mg and see how they respond. If their blood pressure decreases to a healthy level, then we know it works.<p class=message>Great suggestion. And if it doesn't work?<p class="message sent">Then we can try increasing their dosage by 2.5 mg incrementally until we find the right balance.<p class=message>Sounds like a good plan. I always appreciate your expertise, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always a team effort when it comes to patient care.<p class=message>Absolutely. By the way, did you hear the one about the pharmacist who walked into a bar?<p class="message sent">No, what happened?<p class=message>They order a shot of penicillin because they heard it was good for what ails ya!<p class="message sent">Haha, that's a good one. Definitely a unique choice for a drink.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d7959173-107d-424c-98ae-26394b60fe73.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
