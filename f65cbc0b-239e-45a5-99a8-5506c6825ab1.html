How about you?<p class=message>I hit snooze on my alarm a few times, so I started my day a bit late. But I'm excited for lunch.<p class="message sent">Me too! What are you thinking of ordering?<p class=message>I'm torn between the salad and the burger. What about you?<p class="message sent">I'm going for the burger. I'm in the mood for something hearty.<p class=message>Good choice. Have you tried their fries here? They're amazing.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Should we share a side of fries?<p class=message>Definitely. Plus, we can both have the best of both worlds, salad and burger with fries on the side.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. So, how's your work going?<p class=message>It's going pretty well, thanks for asking. Just some small hiccups here and there, but nothing too serious.<p class="message sent">That's good to hear. I'm glad everything is under control.<p class=message>Thanks, and how's your new job?<p class="message sent">It's great. I love the company culture and my coworkers are awesome.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear. With your work and exercise routine, I'm surprised you even have time for lunch.<p class="message sent">Haha, well, a girl's gotta eat! And it's always nicer to eat with good company.<p class=message>Agreed. Speaking of good company, have you heard from our mutual friend lately?<p class="message sent">Not recently, why do you ask?<p class=message>I heard she's planning a trip to Egypt.<p class="message sent">Really? That's amazing. I've always wanted to see the pyramids.<p class=message>Me too. We should start planning our own trip.<p class="message sent">I'm in! Let's use this lunch break to start brainstorming some ideas.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. But first, let's dig in!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f65aee42-31cd-4921-b407-472148b51221.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
