Do you have any experience with this?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm actually the one who manages the databases here. What do you need help with?<p class=message>I'm not quite familiar with the licensing options. Can you explain which one would be best for our company?<p class="message sent">Sure, we have a few options - Enterprise, Standard, and Express. It really depends on our needs and budget.<p class=message>Hmm, I think we would need a lot of features for our project. Would Enterprise be the best choice?<p class="message sent">It's definitely the most comprehensive option, but it also comes with a bigger price tag. Have you considered Standard?<p class=message>I haven't. What's the difference between Standard and Enterprise?<p class="message sent">Standard has most of the same features as Enterprise, but it's limited in some aspects such as the number of virtual machines we can use.<p class=message>I see. Well, I think our budget will allow us to go for Enterprise. Thanks for explaining everything to me, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, always here to help out my fellow coworkers. But don't forget to run it by our manager first!<p class=message>Of course not. So, getting back to work, is your database running smoothly?<p class="message sent">As always, A. What about the projects you're working on?<p class=message>Busy as usual, but I'm getting things done. Speaking of busy, have you had time to try that new restaurant downtown?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I've heard great things about it. You wanna grab lunch there sometime this week?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. It'll be a nice break from all this technical talk.<p class="message sent">Definitely, a little food and conversation can recharge us for the rest of the day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=885dabf0-1272-41d1-9d83-0d2235dd782c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
