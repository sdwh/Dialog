I just finished a long essay for English class.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What subject are you working on now?<p class="message sent">Math. I'm having trouble with this algebra problem.<p class=message>Let me take a look. Hmm, it seems like you just need to distribute the numbers.<p class="message sent">Oh, right. I always forget that. Thanks, Mom.<p class=message>No problem. Hey, did you hear about that new game that just came out?<p class="message sent">Which one?<p class=message>It's called "Zombie Apocalypse 2." It's supposed to be really fun.<p class="message sent">Can we get it, please?<p class=message>Maybe if you finish all your homework and chores this week.<p class="message sent">Deal!<p class=message>By the way, have you decided on what you want to be when you grow up?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I want to be a video game designer.<p class=message>That's a cool career choice. You're really creative, so I think you'd be great at it.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Mom. I've already started making my own games on the computer.<p class=message>Wow, you're way ahead of me. When I was your age, I was still trying to figure out how to use a typewriter.<p class="message sent">Haha, times are different now.<p class=message>For sure. But no matter what, I'm proud of you and I'll always support you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Mom. That means a lot to me.<p class=message>Alright, back to work. Keep up the good work, B.<p class="message sent">Will do, Mom.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4a65af13-8a16-4670-8180-99bddc48c77b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
