Just trying to finish up this assignment before class tomorrow.<p class=message>Good to hear. What subject is it for?<p class="message sent">It's for my literature class. We're reading Shakespeare. How about you, what brings you to the library today?<p class=message>I'm just catching up on some grading. It's always satisfying to see my students' progress.<p class="message sent">Speaking of progress, did you hear about the new study that says reading for just six minutes a day can reduce stress levels by up to 68%?<p class=message>Really? I might need to start incorporating more reading into my daily routine. Do you have any book recommendations?<p class="message sent">Have you tried anything by David Sedaris? He's a humorist who writes short stories and essays.<p class=message>No, but that sounds like it could be a good break from all the serious reading I've been doing. Thanks for the recommendation.<p class="message sent">Anytime. Speaking of breaks, did you see they have a new coffee shop on campus?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">I haven't tried it yet, but I heard they have a latte that's shaped like a cat's face.<p class=message>(laughs) That sounds like something my daughter would love. I'll have to check it out.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Well, I should get back to this assignment. Thanks for the chat, A.<p class=message>No problem, happy studying.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=25cf7e5c-c30a-484f-9a29-cb060cf944b3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
