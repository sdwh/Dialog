It's such a beautiful day today, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes indeed, it's great weather for a road trip. Where are you headed?<p class=message>Actually, I'm headed to Hokkaido. I've always wanted to visit and try their famous food.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing. Any particular dish you're excited to try?<p class=message>I've heard about their seafood, so I definitely want to try some fresh crab or scallops.<p class="message sent">Oh, you'll love it. Hokkaido is famous for their seafood, and it's always fresh.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you have any recommendations for a good restaurant?<p class="message sent">Well, it depends on what you're in the mood for. But personally, I would recommend trying a kaisendon, a bowl of sushi rice topped with fresh seafood. There's a great place I know in Sapporo.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. I'll definitely check it out. By the way, how long have you been driving?<p class="message sent">I've been a taxi driver for about five years now. It's a great job, I get to meet so many interesting people.<p class=message>I can imagine. What's the most interesting customer you've had?<p class="message sent">One time, I had a customer who was traveling with his pet goat! I never expected to have a goat in my cab.<p class=message>That's hilarious! I'm sure that made for an interesting ride.<p class="message sent">Definitely! It was a bit chaotic, but it's a story I won't forget.<p class=message>Well, I hope my ride won't be quite as wild as that. But if it is, I hope I have you as my driver.<p class="message sent">You can count on me to get you safely to your destination, no matter what surprises may come our way!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=98b8be9a-b98a-4b05-aae9-87a7b94826a4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
