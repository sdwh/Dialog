That's so cool!<p class="message sent">(Smiling) I'm a bassoonist, believe it or not. I know, I know. It's not exactly the most exciting instrument out there.<p class=message>(Laughing) Hey, don't sell yourself short! That's still amazing!<p class="message sent">(Grinning) Thanks so much, I really appreciate it. It's definitely a unique instrument, that's for sure.<p class=message>No doubt about it.
