So, have you run into any roadblocks lately?<p class="message sent">Well, we had some issues with compatibility between different modules, but we're figuring it out.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Have you been working on the UI design as well?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been playing around with some new ideas. I think a more minimalist approach might work better.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. I'm sure the users will appreciate a simple, intuitive interface.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's all about making things easy for them. So, how are we doing on the overall schedule?<p class=message>It's looking pretty good for now, but we'll need to stay vigilant to make sure we meet our deadlines.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm planning to do some extra testing to make sure everything is working as expected.<p class=message>That's great to hear. It's always better to catch any bugs before they become bigger problems.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Hey, have you tried the coffee in the lobby? It's surprisingly good.<p class=message>Actually, I haven't. Maybe we should take a break and try some now?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. A little caffeine boost might help us power through the rest of the day.<p class=message>Haha, you read my mind. Let's go grab a cup and get back to work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=695be451-0f46-47d3-ac2b-336eb7a4c488.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
