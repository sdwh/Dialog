We're putting together some new dishes for the menu. What do you think?<p class=message>Excellent! We've been trying to diversify our offerings lately, so what do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">Well, I thought I'd try something with a South African flair. How about a bunny chow?<p class=message>A bunny chow? That sounds interesting. How would you go about making it?<p class="message sent">We'll need some curry, of course, and some bread. I was thinking we could fill the bread with a lamb or chicken curry, depending on what the customers might like.<p class=message>That sounds delicious, and certainly something unique to our menu. What about sides or accompaniments?<p class="message sent">We could pair it with some chutney or pickles, and maybe something refreshing like a cucumber salad.<p class=message>I like the sound of that. What other new dishes are you considering adding to the menu?<p class="message sent">I've also been experimenting with a plantain and black bean soup. It's got some heat to it, but I think it'll be a nice addition.<p class=message>Wow, both of those sound delicious. I'm excited to see how they turn out.<p class="message sent">Me too! I'm going to start prepping the ingredients now. Did you have anything else you wanted me to try?<p class=message>Not at the moment, but let me know if you think of anything else. And keep up the good work!<p class="message sent">Will do, thanks!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=49eaacc4-4617-44bb-b55a-11f98e46c930.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
