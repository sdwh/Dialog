Have you made progress on the project we're working on?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing well, thanks. Yeah, I've been making some headway. Have you had a chance to take a look at what I've done so far?<p class=message>Not yet, sorry. I've been trying to work on my own part of the project.<p class="message sent">That's alright. Let me know if you want me to fill you in on what I've been doing.<p class=message>Sure, I'd appreciate that. But first, can I ask you a random question?<p class="message sent">Of course.<p class=message>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's tough. I think I'd want the ability to control time. What about you?<p class=message>I'd want the power of teleportation. Imagine all the places you could go in an instant!<p class="message sent">That would definitely come in handy for work trips. Speaking of which, have you heard about the company retreat that's coming up?<p class=message>No, I haven't. When is it?<p class="message sent">It's next month. Apparently, we're going to be spending a weekend at a resort.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like fun! I hope they have good Wi-Fi so we can still finish up our work if we need to.<p class="message sent">Agreed. But let's not think about work right now. I brought in some donuts to share.<p class=message>You're the best, B. Donuts make everything better.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8ea87ad5-ff77-4388-be6d-87d4427bda77.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
