I'd like to check out and settle my bill, please.<p class="message sent">Morning! Sure thing. Did you enjoy your stay with us, sir?<p class=message>Yes, I did. The room was cozy and the staff were all friendly and attentive.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! Can I confirm if you used any of our additional services like the minibar or laundry service?<p class=message>No, I didn't actually. I just had breakfast at the hotel restaurant.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'll just double-check your bill to make sure everything is in order. By the way, did you try our signature dish, the 'hotel burger'?<p class=message>No, I didn't, but it sounds delicious. Maybe next time!<p class="message sent">Definitely! We also have a special room service menu with some exclusive items.<p class=message>That sounds tempting, but I'm trying to watch my budget this time. Maybe on a special occasion.<p class="message sent">Of course, sir. Your total bill comes to $250. Will you be paying cash or by card?<p class=message>I'll be paying by my credit card, please.<p class="message sent">Alright. Thank you very much for choosing our hotel. We hope to see you again soon.<p class=message>Thank you for your hospitality. I had a great stay.<p class="message sent">It was our pleasure.
