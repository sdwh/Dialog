Are we ready to prepare some delicious local dishes for our customers today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Chef A! Yes, we have a lot of customers requesting for our specialty dishes like pig trotters with vermicelli and pineapple cakes.<p class=message>Great! That's what I love about Taiwan, you can always find amazing street food like these. Let me get the ingredients and start cooking.<p class="message sent">Speaking of street food, have you tried the stinky tofu from the stall beside us? It's famous around this area.<p class=message>Oh, yes I have! I was hesitant at first but gave it a try and loved it. It was stinky but tasted amazing!<p class="message sent">That's right! You can't judge a book by its cover. Just like our pig trotters, some people might find it unappetizing, but once they tasted it, they can't get enough.<p class=message>That's true. Our customers always come back for more. And our pineapple cakes are always sold out within an hour of baking them.<p class="message sent">Everyone loves our pineapple cakes, especially the ones made fresh daily. We have to make sure to restock so that our customers won't leave empty-handed.<p class=message>Agreed. Alright, the pig trotters are simmering and the vermicelli is almost done. How about you restock the pineapple cakes while I prepare the orders?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! Let's make sure to serve our customers with the best quality food and keep them happy and satisfied.<p class=message>Absolutely! Let's get to work and make this a great day for our customers.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=41f6a18c-5452-4b89-be49-69b311048ae1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
