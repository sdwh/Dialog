Can you help me come up with an itinerary?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What kind of sights are you interested in seeing?<p class=message>I definitely want to visit the Great Wall and the Forbidden City. But I'm also interested in trying some local street food.<p class="message sent">Perfect! For the Great Wall, there are a few different sections you can visit. How much time do you want to spend there?<p class=message>I think a half-day should be enough. I don't want to tire myself out too much.<p class="message sent">That's a smart idea. Now, for the Forbidden City, it's a massive complex. If you want to see everything, you'll need about a full day.<p class=message>Hmm, I don't think I have the energy for that. Is there a shorter version of the tour?<p class="message sent">Yes, of course! We can plan a condensed tour that still hits all the highlights. And for street food, I have the perfect night market in mind. You'll get to try all sorts of delicious snacks.<p class=message>Sounds great. Can we fit in any cultural performances or museums?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I recommend trying to see a traditional Beijing opera show. And the National Museum of China is a must-visit.<p class=message>Wow, it sounds like there's so much to see and do. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. I'm glad I could assist you in planning your Beijing adventure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7d6ea878-68c1-48a6-a3b5-6dcde8527ba1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
