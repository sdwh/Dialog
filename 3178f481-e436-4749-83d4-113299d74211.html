How did everything go last night?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. It went great! We had a full house and everyone enjoyed the dishes.<p class=message>That's wonderful to hear. Today we have some new guests coming in, so we need to make sure everything is up to our high standards.<p class="message sent">Of course, what's the plan for today?<p class=message>We need to make sure all the ingredients are stocked up and make a plan for the specials. I was thinking of featuring our famous Coq au Vin.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. I can start prepping the chicken, marinate it in red wine and vegetables for a few hours.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. And let's also make sure to do a thorough cleaning of the kitchen and dining area.<p class="message sent">Will do. By the way, I was thinking of adding a new dessert to the menu. What do you think of a lavender creme brulee?<p class=message>Sounds very fancy and delicious. Let's give it a try and see how it turns out.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I'll start working on that after I finish the Coq au Vin.<p class=message>Great job, B. I really appreciate all your hard work and dedication.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It's a pleasure working here and creating amazing dishes for our customers.<p class=message>We're lucky to have you on our team. Let's work hard and make today another successful day at the restaurant!<p class="message sent">Absolutely, let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3172df10-0cf3-4961-86fe-f0d0e7321128.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
