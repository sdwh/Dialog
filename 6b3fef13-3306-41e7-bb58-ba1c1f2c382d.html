How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm good, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. Hey, have you noticed an increase in the number of shipments arriving with damages lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's becoming a bit of a problem. I think we need to take a closer look at the packaging and labeling of these boxes.<p class=message>That's a good point. Do you think we should start labeling the fragile boxes as well as using bubble wrap to protect them?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's a simple solution that can prevent most damages. Plus, it's always better to be safe than sorry.<p class=message>I agree. And it will save us money in the long run too. We won't have to replace as many damaged products.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And it will also improve our reputation with our customers since they will receive their packages in good condition.<p class=message>Great idea. Let's make sure to communicate this to everyone involved in the shipping process.<p class="message sent">Will do. I'll send out an email with the new procedures and make sure everyone is on board.<p class=message>Perfect. Thanks, B. You always have good suggestions.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6b3d346c-f98e-4d66-9521-43a0362ece3a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
