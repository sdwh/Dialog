We have a fun topic today: superheroes. Who's your favorite superhero?<p class="message sent">I like Iron Man. He's smart and has a lot of cool gadgets.<p class=message>Ah, good choice. Did you know that Iron Man's suit is actually inspired by a real-life invention called exoskeleton?<p class="message sent">Really? That's cool! Can I make my own exoskeleton suit?<p class=message>Haha, maybe someday in the future. But for now, let's focus on today's lesson. Did you guys know that Superman was originally created to be a villain?<p class="message sent">No way! Why would they do that?<p class=message>I guess they thought it would be interesting to have a character with immense power but uses it for evil. But as the story developed, they realized that Superman's true potential was being a hero.<p class="message sent">That's so cool! I'm glad they changed their minds.<p class=message>Me too! Now, let's do a group activity. I'm going to assign each of you a superhero and I want you to come up with a creative way on how they can use their powers.<p class="message sent">Awesome! Can't wait to get started.<p class=message>Great. And don't forget, even though they may have superpowers, it's their heroism that truly makes them a hero.<p class="message sent">Duly noted, teacher. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=45b00128-8e99-481a-8ecb-f4138037f844.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
