Today, let's start with a fun question. What was the last movie you watched?<p class="message sent">Hi, Teacher! I watched "Jumanji" last weekend with my friends. It was hilarious!<p class=message>Oh, I've heard good things about that one. Did you like it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it was really entertaining. The special effects were amazing too.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Speaking of movies, have you watched any classics recently? Like "The Godfather" or "Gone with the Wind"?<p class="message sent">Actually, I haven't. I'm more into action and comedy movies.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Well, maybe one day you'll develop a taste for classics. Now, let's move on to our lesson for today.<p class="message sent">Sure, what's on the agenda?<p class=message>We'll be discussing the benefits of traveling. Can you tell me why you think it's important to travel?<p class="message sent">I think traveling helps us broaden our perspectives and learn about different cultures. Plus, it's a fun way to make new memories.<p class=message>Very well put, B. And on that note, have you traveled to any interesting places recently?<p class="message sent">Yes, I went to Japan last summer. It was such an amazing experience! The food, the people, and the sights were all incredible.<p class=message>That sounds fantastic. I hope to visit Japan one day myself. Now, let's get started with the lesson. Remember, the more you learn, the more places you'll be able to explore in the future!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ae3692eb-ebe9-4240-aac5-eb6f591fbde4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
