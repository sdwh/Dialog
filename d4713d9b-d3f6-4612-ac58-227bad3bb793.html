How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm feeling better today, thank you.<p class=message>That's great to hear! Have you been getting plenty of rest?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. But, to be honest, being in the hospital is a bit boring.<p class=message>I understand. Have you watched any good movies or read any interesting books?<p class="message sent">Actually, I've been binge-watching some shows on Netflix. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Hmm, have you watched "Stranger Things" or "Narcos"?<p class="message sent">Yes, I loved "Stranger Things"! Maybe I'll check out "Narcos" next.<p class=message>"Narcos" is really good. You should watch it with the English subtitles on to improve your language skills.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! I've been practicing some English phrases with the staff, too.<p class=message>Excellent! Speaking of practicing, have you been doing your breathing exercises?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They've been helping a lot. Thanks for reminding me.<p class=message>You're welcome. Keep it up! Have you had any visitors recently?<p class="message sent">Yeah, my family came to visit yesterday. We played some board games and it was nice to spend time with them.<p class=message>That sounds fun! What's your favorite board game?<p class="message sent">I love playing Monopoly, but my family always cheats!<p class=message>Haha, I know that feeling. Well, I'm glad you're feeling better and staying entertained. Let me know if you need anything.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. You've been such a helpful assistant.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d46c8539-418a-4a18-8ced-eeeb4f224a04.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
