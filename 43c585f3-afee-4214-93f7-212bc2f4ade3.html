May I ask for your name and what you do?<p class="message sent">Oh hi, I'm Sarah and I'm a preschool teacher.<p class=message>That's lovely. So, what makes you love teaching preschoolers?<p class="message sent">Well, it's always amusing to see them discover something new and learn alongside them.<p class=message>Yes, I can imagine. Do you have any funny stories you can share with us?<p class="message sent">Actually, just last week, one of my students tried to convince me that he was a superhero and could fly.<p class=message>(laughs) Kids are imaginative that way. Do you have any tips for parents with young children?<p class="message sent">I think it's important to stay patient and always keep on communicating with your child, even when they're being difficult.<p class=message>Absolutely agree. So, what do you do for fun when you're not teaching?<p class="message sent">I enjoy reading books and going on hikes with my dog.<p class=message>Sounds like a good balance. One last question, what's the most rewarding part of being a preschool teacher?<p class="message sent">Watching my students grow and develop into confident and curious individuals is definitely the most rewarding part.<p class=message>Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences with us.<p class="message sent">My pleasure.
