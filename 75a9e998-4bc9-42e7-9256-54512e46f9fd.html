I love Arcade. Which game do you want to play?<p class=message>Let's play Street Fighter. I'm pretty good at it.<p class="message sent">Alright, but don't get too confident, I've been practicing my moves.<p class=message>Haha, we'll see about that. Player 1 or 2?<p class="message sent">I'll be Player 1, since that's the side I practiced on.<p class=message>Sounds good. Ready, set, fight!<p class="message sent">Wow, you're really good at this. How did you learn all these moves?<p class=message>I used to play it all the time when I was a kid, and I still play it occasionally.<p class="message sent">I wish I had played it more when I was younger. I'm having a hard time keeping up.<p class=message>Don't worry, it's all about timing and strategy. You'll get the hang of it.<p class="message sent">Yeah, hopefully sooner rather than later. I don't want to lose every round.<p class=message>Haha, don't worry, losing is a part of the learning process. Plus, it's just a game.<p class="message sent">I know, but it's more fun when you win.<p class=message>True, but it's also more fun when you have a good opponent. You're keeping me on my toes.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I'm trying my best. Ooh, I think I landed a good combo there.<p class=message>Nice, that was impressive. I might have to step up my game now.<p class="message sent">Haha, bring it on! This is turning out to be a really fun game.<p class=message>Definitely, I love playing with someone who enjoys it as much as I do.<p class="message sent">Same here. Let's do this again sometime.<p class=message>For sure, I'm always up for a good round of Arcade.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=75a67201-26e2-4171-bbb0-bfc33a30b8d1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
