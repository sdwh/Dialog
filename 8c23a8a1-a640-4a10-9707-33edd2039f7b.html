How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thank you. Can you take me to the airport?<p class="message sent">Sure, which airport are you flying out of?<p class=message>Oh, my apologies. I meant to say, I'm actually going on a trip to Hokkaido, can you take me there?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Hokkaido's a beautiful place, have you been there before?<p class=message>No, it will be my first time visiting. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. My favorite part was definitely the seafood, especially the crab.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! I can't wait to try some myself.<p class="message sent">Well, you're in luck. Hokkaido is known for its fresh and delicious seafood.<p class=message>That's great to know, but what else would you recommend doing there?<p class="message sent">There are so many things to do, from hiking in the mountains to strolling through the lavender fields. But my personal favorite is visiting the Sapporo Beer Museum.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting. Do they offer beer tastings?<p class="message sent">Yes, they certainly do! And they even have a signature Hokkaido-style beer.<p class=message>Wow, I'm definitely going to have to check that out then.<p class="message sent">I highly recommend it. So, what brings you to Hokkaido?<p class=message>I'm going on a business trip, actually.<p class="message sent">Ah, well, don't forget to take some time to enjoy the sights and sounds of Hokkaido while you're there.<p class=message>I will definitely try to do that. Thank you for the advice!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. We're almost at the airport now, have a safe and enjoyable trip to Hokkaido.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8c217279-b2d2-4022-ab9f-73bfdb9f589b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
