I was looking at the test results from yesterday, and I think we need to improve our testing process.<p class="message sent">Hi, A! Yes, I agree. What do you suggest?<p class=message>I think we could benefit from more automated testing. It would save time and ensure consistency in our tests.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. Have you looked into any specific tools for automated testing?<p class=message>Yes, I've researched a few options. I think the one that suits our needs the best is Selenium.<p class="message sent">Perfect. Let's get started on implementing that. And while we're on the topic of improving our process, what do you think about incorporating a bug bounty program?<p class=message>Wow, that's an interesting proposal, B. Could you explain it a bit more?<p class="message sent">Sure. Basically, we would give rewards to anyone who discovers and reports vulnerabilities in our software. It could incentivize people to report bugs, and ultimately benefit our company's security.<p class=message>Ah, I see. That sounds like a great idea.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's a popular practice in the tech industry. Let's look into setting one up.<p class=message>Definitely. And on a different note, have you heard about the new coffee machine in the break room?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yes, I have. I think I've had three cups already this morning.<p class=message>(laughs) Well, I think we could use some caffeine to power through this morning's meeting.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's grab some before we head in.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5ccbe03d-d203-4cc3-92f1-3790327877f4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
