Have you driven there before, B?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I've been driving in Tokyo for years now. It's a crazy ride, but I love it.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I'm a bit nervous about the traffic and all the different road signs.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I'll make sure to keep us on the right track. And if you're feeling adventurous, we can take some backstreets to avoid the crowds.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Have you ever had any wild experiences driving in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Oh man, too many to count. Once, I even had a geisha jump in my cab and ask me to outrun some guys who were chasing her.<p class=message>No way! Did you manage to get away?<p class="message sent">You bet! I hit the accelerator and we flew through the streets like something out of a movie.<p class=message>That's incredible. I hope we have a more peaceful ride today, but it's nice to know you can handle anything that comes our way.<p class="message sent">I'm always up for a challenge! Plus, Tokyo's always full of surprises.<p class=message>Speaking of surprises, have you tried any unusual foods here?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, I love to explore different restaurants. Last week, I had this amazing octopus dish that was out of this world.<p class=message>Octopus? That's pretty adventurous.<p class="message sent">Hey, you never know until you try it. Plus, Tokyo's famous for its seafood.<p class=message>Hmm, maybe I'll have to give it a go. Any other recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely try some tempura or yakitori. And if you're feeling brave, there's always natto.<p class=message>Natto? What's that?<p class="message sent">It's a type of fermented soybean dish. Some people love it, others not so much. But you have to try it at least once.<p class=message>I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for all the tips, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to share my Tokyo knowledge. We're almost there now, so get ready to see the sights.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=715b309b-0950-4e0f-9a4a-e4608b6a7da5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
