It's nice to meet you. I'm the food quality control specialist here. Can you tell me a little bit about your experience in making kimchi?<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm happy to be here. I've been making kimchi for over twenty years and learned the recipe from my grandmother. I believe that the secret to good kimchi is all in the ingredients and the fermentation process.<p class=message>That's great to hear. We take the quality of our ingredients seriously here at the factory. So, what kind of ingredients do you typically use when making kimchi?<p class="message sent">We use Napa cabbage, radish, garlic, ginger, and gochugaru, which is our traditional Korean spice. We also add fish sauce to give it a savory taste.<p class=message>Wow, it sounds delicious. So, what kind of quality control measures do you take when making your kimchi?<p class="message sent">We make sure to thoroughly wash all of our vegetables and use only fresh and healthy ingredients. We also carefully monitor the fermentation process to ensure that the kimchi is safe for consumption.<p class=message>That's very important. Speaking of safety, have you ever had any mishaps while making kimchi?<p class="message sent">Well, one time I accidentally spilled a whole jar of gochugaru on the floor. It was quite a mess to clean up!<p class=message>Oh no, I can imagine. Do you have any tips for ensuring that the kimchi stays fresh and flavorful?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's important to store the kimchi in a cool and dark place, away from direct sunlight. And, of course, make sure to enjoy it within a reasonable amount of time!<p class=message>Definitely. Well, thank you for sharing your expertise with me. It was great chatting with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise, it's always nice to share my love of kimchi with others. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=70128738-5ece-46d1-b9bf-012883951ed6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
