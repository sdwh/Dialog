How's it going?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It's going well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well too. I was thinking, we should come up with some new desserts to add to our menu.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! What kind of desserts were you thinking of?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of something with a tropical twist, like a mango pudding or coconut milk jelly.<p class="message sent">Oh, I love those desserts! I could definitely make those for you.<p class=message>Awesome! And maybe we could also add some mini egg tarts and sesame balls as well.<p class="message sent">Yes, those are classic favorites. I'll make them in different flavors too, like pandan and taro.<p class=message>That's perfect. You really are a master at making desserts, B.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. And you are the master of making delicious dim sum. I think our customers will love these new additions to our menu.<p class=message>I agree. Our restaurant is already popular with locals and tourists, but these new desserts will make us even more popular.<p class="message sent">Speaking of tourists, have you noticed an increase in customers from other countries lately?<p class=message>Yes, I have. I think it's because of the Chinese New Year celebrations in Chinatown. People come to Chinatown to experience the festivities and try authentic Chinese food.<p class="message sent">That's true. We should also add some special Chinese New Year desserts and drinks to our menu for the occasion.<p class=message>Great idea! Maybe we could make red bean soup or sweet rice balls with a sesame filling.<p class="message sent">And we could also make some traditional Chinese drinks like ginger tea or chrysanthemum tea.<p class=message>I love it. We always work well together, B. I'm lucky to have you as my partner.<p class="message sent">Same here, A. Together we make the perfect team, providing the best authentic Hong Kong-style dim sum and desserts in Chinatown!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=66870f17-434e-4fe9-b64a-2321a58c1818.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
