How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks. So, I heard you're working on writing a security audit plan for ISO 27001?<p class="message sent">Yup, that's right. It's a bit of a daunting task, but I think I'm starting to wrap my head around it.<p class=message>That's good to hear. Do you have any tips or tricks for getting started on something like that?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I think the key is to break it down into manageable sections and tackle each one step by step. And, of course, don't be afraid to seek out help or advice from other experts in the field.<p class=message>Wise words, my friend. Have you come across any interesting or unexpected findings so far?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes. I was surprised to learn just how much of an impact physical security measures can have on overall cybersecurity.<p class=message>That makes sense. It's easy to forget that protecting our physical assets is just as important as protecting our digital ones.<p class="message sent">Exactly. And I think that's what makes working in this field so exciting - there's always something new to learn and discover.<p class=message>Well said. And hey, if you ever need a second pair of eyes to look over your audit plan, I'm happy to help out.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I appreciate that. The more perspectives we have, the better the end result will be.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=409dccf7-30ba-4f7a-b794-24e65dd317eb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
