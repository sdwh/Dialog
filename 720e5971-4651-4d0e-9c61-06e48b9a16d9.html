How are you feeling?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Doctor. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit nervous.<p class=message>Don't worry, B. You are in good hands. We have performed this surgery countless of times.<p class="message sent">That's reassuring to hear, Doctor.<p class=message>So, B, have you been practicing deep breathing exercises like we talked about?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It has really helped to calm me down.<p class=message>Great job, B! That will help us during the procedure.<p class="message sent">Just out of curiosity, Doctor, have you ever accidentally left something inside a patient during a surgery?<p class=message>(laughs) No, B. And please stop watching those medical dramas on TV. We always double-check everything to make sure that doesn't happen.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Alright, Doctor. You caught me.<p class=message>Now, take a deep breath, B, and let's get started. The anesthesia will take effect soon.<p class="message sent">Alright, I trust you, Doctor. Let's do this.<p class=message>That's the spirit, B. We'll be done in no time. If you feel any discomfort, let us know and we'll adjust accordingly.<p class="message sent">Okay, Doctor. I'm ready.<p class=message>Alright, B. We're done.<p class="message sent">(wakes up from anesthesia) Wow, that was quick. How did it go, Doctor?<p class=message>Everything went perfectly, B. You did great too.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Thank you, Doctor. I can't believe it's over.<p class=message>(smiling back) That's what we're here for, B. To make sure everything goes smoothly. Now, let's get you to your recovery room.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Sounds like a plan, Doctor. Thank you again.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=720c808d-669c-40ff-9521-21e19ba6297b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
