How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not bad, A. Just trying to figure out the best SQL Server licensing option for our company. Do you have any ideas?<p class=message>Well, we could opt for the Core-based licensing model, which is best suited for companies with a large number of users and a high volume of transactions.<p class="message sent">That sounds reasonable. However, I was also considering the CAL-based licensing model, which requires us to purchase client access licenses based on the number of users accessing the system.<p class=message>That's a good point, B. We could save some money with that option, particularly if we have a smaller user base.<p class="message sent">Exactly. I'm also weighing the pros and cons of SQL Server Enterprise vs. Standard editions. What do you think?<p class=message>Enterprise is definitely more feature-rich, with better scalability and security options. However, if those features aren't necessary for us, Standard could be a more cost-effective choice.<p class="message sent">Hmm, you make a good point. I'll have to think about that further. Thanks for your input, A.<p class=message>Of course, anytime. Have you looked into any third-party licensing management tools that could help us monitor and optimize our SQL Server usage?<p class="message sent">Actually, that's a great idea. I'll start researching that as well. Thanks again, A. You're always so helpful.<p class=message>No problem, B. We're in this together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=38745a0d-524c-47d0-a8d3-8c806d9cd649.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
