Ready to catch some waves today?<p class="message sent">Yes, sir! I've been looking forward to this surf lesson all week.<p class=message>Great to hear. Let's start off with some basic warm-up exercises to get your blood flowing.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. What do I need to do?<p class=message>We'll start with some stretches first. Place your left arm over your head and reach towards the right side of your body, and hold it for 10 seconds. Then switch to the other side.<p class="message sent">Got it. How does that feel?<p class=message>Good start. Now let's jog up and down the beach to get your legs moving.<p class="message sent">(panting) Whew, I didn't realize running on sand was so tough.<p class=message>It definitely is. But it's all worth it once you start surfing those waves. Let's get you fitted with a wetsuit and board next.<p class="message sent">(wearing the wetsuit) Wow, this wetsuit is snug!<p class=message>That's the idea. It'll keep you warm and protected from the sun and sand.<p class="message sent">And what about the board?<p class=message>This is a beginner-friendly board. It's long and stable so you can easily balance on it.<p class="message sent">I hope I don't fall off too much.<p class=message>Falling off is part of the learning process. Don't worry, I'll be there to help you get back on the board.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's do this!<p class=message>Here's the plan. We'll start off in the shallows and practice paddling and standing up on the board.<p class="message sent">Got it.<p class=message>(pointing at waves coming) Here comes a good one. Let's paddle towards it and try to catch it.<p class="message sent">(paddling hard and standing up on the board) Yeehaw! This is awesome!<p class=message>You're a natural, B! Keep it up!<p class="message sent">(riding on the wave) I never knew surfing could be so thrilling!<p class=message>That's the spirit. You're doing great!<p class="message sent">(getting wiped out by a wave) Help!<p class=message>Don't panic. Just hold on to your board and swim back to shore.<p class="message sent">(coughing and laughing) That was fun! Can we do it again?<p class=message>You betcha! Let's catch another wave and see how far we can ride it this time.<p class="message sent">(smiling) Alright, coach. Let's go for it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=786347a5-962d-4c97-a88b-4125c15de694.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
