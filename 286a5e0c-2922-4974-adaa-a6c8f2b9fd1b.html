Nice to meet you, B.<p class="message sent">Hello, A. It's a pleasure to meet you too. I'm in charge of the cocktails. What do you recommend for today's afternoon tea?<p class=message>How about our seasonal fruit tarts? They're made with fresh fruits like strawberries, blueberries, and peaches. They're sweet and tangy, perfect for a hot summer day.<p class="message sent">That sounds lovely. How about something to drink with it?<p class=message>We have a new Earl Grey tea latte that's been getting a lot of attention lately. It's creamy and smooth, with a hint of bergamot.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'll try that. And for those who prefer something stronger, what would you suggest?<p class=message>Our signature cocktail is the "Sweet Surrender," made with vodka, lemon juice, raspberry syrup, and a splash of sparkling wine. It's fruity and refreshing.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. I'll make one for you to look at while I whip up a batch of my "Sapphire Sunriser." It's a gin-based cocktail with orange juice, grenadine, and a splash of blue curacao. It's colorful and fun.<p class=message>Wow, that looks amazing. I bet it tastes great too.<p class="message sent">Here you go, try it out. I bet it'll complement your tarts perfectly.<p class=message>Mmm, this is really good. The citrusy note really brings out the tartness of the fruit.<p class="message sent">That's what I aim for â€“ to create drinks that enhances the flavors of the desserts they're served with.<p class=message>Well, you definitely succeeded with this one. I'm going to recommend this combination to all my customers!<p class="message sent">And I'll be sure to recommend your fruit tarts to everyone who comes by for drinks.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=28639c2b-52e4-4701-9ba1-f52511175ff0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
