I'm a data scientist.<p class="message sent">Nice to meet you, A. I'm B. I specialize in artificial intelligence.<p class=message>Great! We're here to discuss how we can use AI to discover new drugs.<p class="message sent">That's right. AI models can analyze vast amounts of data that humans cannot.<p class=message>Absolutely. And with the right algorithms, we may be able to predict which compounds have the potential to become successful drugs.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we won't have to waste time testing every single compound, only the ones that the AI models have flagged.<p class=message>Exactly! And with the advancements in AI technologies, we can even design new molecules from scratch that may have therapeutic potential.<p class="message sent">That's fascinating. We can use deep learning neural networks to generate new drug candidates.<p class=message>Right, and we can also use natural language processing to scan through thousands of research papers and identify potential targets for new drugs.<p class="message sent">Yes, AI can be a game-changer in the pharmaceutical industry. But we must also ensure that the AI models are unbiased and transparent.<p class=message>Agreed. We must also ensure that we have robust ethical considerations in place when designing new drugs with AI.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's important. But imagine the possibilities if we can use AI to discover new drugs that could cure diseases that currently have no known treatments.<p class=message>It's incredibly exciting. I can't wait to see where this field goes as we continue to push the boundaries of AI and drug discovery.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. It's been great chatting with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dae60719-df8e-420d-a9cd-4e90772025b9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
