They're these amazing little pockets of goodness that you absolutely HAVE to try.<p class="message sent">Oh, I see. I actually haven't tried them before. What exactly are they?<p class=message>Well, they're like turnovers, except with a Latin American twist. They're stuffed with all kinds of delicious fillings, like beef, chicken, cheese, and veggies.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious! What kind of sauce do you usually eat them with?<p class=message>Oh, there are so many options! Some people like to dip them in salsa, while others prefer a spicy chimichurri sauce or even a sweet and tangy tamarind dipping sauce.<p class="message sent">I'm definitely sold! Where can I get my hands on some of these Empanadas?<p class=message>There are tons of places around here that sell them. There's even a food truck that specializes in them! We should totally hit them up for lunch.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan to me! What's your favorite kind of Empanada filling?<p class=message>Ooh, tough call. I'm a big fan of the classic beef and cheese combo, but I also love trying new things. I had a delicious plantain and black bean Empanada once that was out of this world.<p class="message sent">Yum, that sounds amazing. I'll have to try that one too.<p class=message>Absolutely! And hey, if you're feeling daring, we could even try making our own Empanadas sometime. I've got a killer recipe.<p class="message sent">That sounds like so much fun! Let's definitely do that. Thanks for introducing me to Empanadas, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. Food is the universal language, after all!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=21e8b455-4fc3-49b4-914f-d6f248ea9347.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
