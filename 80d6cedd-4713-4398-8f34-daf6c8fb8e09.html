Ready to talk testing?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What have you been working on lately?<p class=message>Well, we've been focusing on testing the checkout process. We want to make sure it's not just stable, but also secure.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. What kind of tests have you been running?<p class=message>We've been doing some exploratory testing, as well as running automated tests for edge cases.<p class="message sent">Nice! Have you found any bugs or vulnerabilities?<p class=message>Yeah, we found a couple of edge cases that were causing issues with payments. But we were able to fix them pretty quickly.<p class="message sent">That's fantastic. How about security testing?<p class=message>We've been running some penetration tests and vulnerability scans. We want to make sure our systems are secure from any outside attacks.<p class="message sent">Sounds like you're on top of things. What advice would you give to other testers?<p class=message>I would say to always be curious and never assume anything. You never know what kind of bugs or vulnerabilities you might find.<p class="message sent">Good advice. And always make sure to document your findings thoroughly!<p class=message>Definitely. You never want to miss anything important. But hey, let's not forget to have some fun while we're at it, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Testing can be serious work, but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy ourselves. Cheers to stable and secure software!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=80d5eabd-6366-4001-bef8-d6963ff043d1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
