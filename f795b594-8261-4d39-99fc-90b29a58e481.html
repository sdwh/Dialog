Do you know if there were any incidents last night?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm not entirely sure, but I heard there was a robbery at a convenience store down the street.<p class=message>Oh, no! That's awful. We have to be more vigilant than ever now.<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely. But I must admit, my job as a cashier makes me a bit nervous sometimes. I feel like I'm always a target for thieves.<p class=message>I understand how you feel, but you know what they say – don't mess with a cashier who handles money all day, right?<p class="message sent">(giggles) True. But let's hope we don't have any incidents here. It's usually pretty quiet at this time.<p class=message>Yes, let's hope so. By the way, have you seen any suspicious individuals around lately?<p class="message sent">Not really. But I did see a guy wearing a hoodie and acting strangely earlier this morning. I think he just wanted to buy some snacks, but it never hurts to keep an eye on people, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. I'll keep an eye on him too. And if anything happens, just press the panic button under the counter and I'll be here in a jiffy.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. It's good to know we have each other's backs.<p class=message>That's what teamwork is all about, B. Speaking of which, have you tried that new energy drink we're selling here yet?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class=message>It's pretty tasty, and it gives you a boost of energy when you need it most. You should try it sometime.<p class="message sent">I just might. Thanks for the recommendation, A.<p class=message>No problem. We have to stick together and look out for each other, both on and off duty, right?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Hey, speaking of energy drinks, I just had an idea – why don't we organize a charity run to raise money for a good cause, and promote our energy drink at the same time?<p class=message>(smiling) Now that's a brilliant idea. Count me in, B. Let's make a difference and have some fun at the same time!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f78f8934-95df-413b-86be-4620bee4d83b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
