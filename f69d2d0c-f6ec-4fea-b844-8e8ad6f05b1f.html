Today, we have a special guest, B, who is a software engineer, and he will introduce us to the latest backend development technology. Hi B, thanks for joining us today.<p class="message sent">Hi A, it's great to be here. Thank you for having me.<p class=message>So, tell us, what's the latest technology in backend development that people are talking about?<p class="message sent">Well, the latest technology is serverless computing. It's a new approach that allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about managing servers.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds interesting. Can you tell us more about it?<p class="message sent">Sure. With serverless computing, developers write code in small functions that are executed only when needed. There's no need to provision or manage servers. The cloud provider takes care of everything, including scaling and availability.<p class=message>That sounds like it can save a lot of time and resources. Is it easy to implement?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's easy to implement. Developers can use popular programming languages like Java, Python, and Node.js to write serverless functions. It's also easy to scale and monitor them.<p class=message>That's great to hear. What are some of the benefits of using serverless computing?<p class="message sent">Well, one of the benefits is cost savings. With traditional server-based applications, you have to pay for hardware and maintenance. With serverless computing, you only pay for the time your functions are running. Another benefit is increased agility. You can deploy new features quickly without worrying about infrastructure.<p class=message>That definitely sounds like a game-changer for developers. Thanks B for sharing this exciting technology with us today. It was great having you on our show.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, A. It was my pleasure.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f69a7314-af16-4d01-bf5d-fbab85ba4658.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
