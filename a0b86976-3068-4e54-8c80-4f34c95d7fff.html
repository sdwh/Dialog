What kind of seafood are you looking for?<p class=message>I'm looking for the freshest seafood I can find. I want to impress my friends with a delicious seafood feast.<p class="message sent">Well, you're in luck because we have some of the freshest and tastiest seafood in the area. We get our catch every day from the local fishermen.<p class=message>That sounds great! What kind of seafood do you recommend?<p class="message sent">We have a variety of seafood here, from the classic fish and chips to scallops and lobster. Our most popular dish is our crab cakes.<p class=message>Mmm, crab cakes sound amazing. Can you tell me more about them?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, our crab cakes are made with fresh crab meat from the harbor. We season it with our secret blend of spices and mix it with some bread crumbs and eggs to hold it all together. We then fry them up to crispy perfection.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! How do you get your crab meat so fresh?<p class="message sent">We have a special agreement with the local fishermen to get the freshest crab meat straight from the source. They bring it to us every day as soon as they catch it.<p class=message>Sounds like you really know your stuff. I can't wait to try it all out. Thanks for the recommendations!<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Be sure to stop by our restaurant and try everything out. We also have daily specials depending on what the fishermen bring in that day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a0b71a23-d875-4ed5-a38c-c839afd6afbe.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
