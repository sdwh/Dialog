Have you been to Lithuania before?<p class=message>No, this will be my first time.<p class="message sent">Well, there's lots to do. Are you more interested in exploring cities or nature?<p class=message>I prefer to mix it up. Maybe a little of both?<p class="message sent">Great! For nature, I recommend visiting the Curonian Spit. It's a beautiful sand dune peninsula with stunning views of the Baltic Sea.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! What about cities?<p class="message sent">Vilnius is a must-see. It's the capital city and has a charming Old Town with lots of history and culture. You can also visit Trakai Island Castle, which is just outside of the city.<p class=message>I've heard about the food in Lithuania, any recommendations on what to try?<p class="message sent">Definitely try the Cepelinai, it's a national dish made out of grated and boiled potatoes, stuffed with minced meat and served with sour cream. And don't forget the Lithuanian beer!<p class=message>Sounds delicious. Any other tips for my trip?<p class="message sent">Sure, bring comfortable shoes for walking and dress in layers as the weather can be unpredictable. And don't forget to visit the Hill of Crosses, it's an amazing site with thousands of crosses that have been placed there over the years.<p class=message>Thanks so much for all the advice, I can't wait to start exploring Lithuania!<p class="message sent">No problem, have a great trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b9ccc3db-71fe-4604-a338-efb170b3e22d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
