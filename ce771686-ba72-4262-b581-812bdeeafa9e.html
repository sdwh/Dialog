How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing well, thank you. How about you, A?<p class=message>I'm doing great. I was hoping to bounce an idea off of you. You're a pharmaceutical expert, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct.<p class=message>Well, I have this orchard, and I was thinking about producing something from the fruit that could be used in the pharmaceutical industry. Do you have any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Interesting idea. What kind of fruit do you have in your orchard?<p class=message>We have a lot of peaches and apricots, and we also have some figs.<p class="message sent">I see. Peach and apricot pits contain amygdalin, which has been used to treat cancer. It might be worth exploring that option.<p class=message>That's fascinating. Do you think we could develop a product from the amygdalin that people could easily consume?<p class="message sent">It's possible. We could look into encapsulating the amygdalin in a pill or formulating it into a liquid extract.<p class=message>I like that idea. I think it could be a great way to put our fruit to good use.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. The pharmaceutical industry is always looking for new treatments, and natural products like these are becoming increasingly popular.<p class=message>It's exciting to think about the possibilities. Thank you so much for your input, B.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, A. I'm always happy to help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ce757aa2-55d7-49bc-9e60-258c6261a549.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
