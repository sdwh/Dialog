What can I get for you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm in the mood for something sweet and refreshing. Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>Absolutely! Our custard buns are very popular, and we also have freshly made egg tarts. As for something refreshing, you might enjoy our mango juice or iced barley tea.<p class="message sent">That sounds great! I'll take an egg tart and a cup of the mango juice, please.<p class=message>Excellent choice! That'll be 28 yuan altogether. While I prepare your order, can I ask what kind of drinks you like to make?<p class="message sent">Of course! I like to experiment with different flavors and textures. Lately, I've been into making fruit smoothies and bubble teas.<p class=message>Oh, those are some of my favorites! What's your secret to making a perfect bubble tea?<p class="message sent">Ha! I can't give away all my secrets, but I will tell you that using fresh ingredients and measuring everything precisely is key. And, of course, the bubbles have to be soft and chewy.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work, but I'm sure it's worth it. Here's your egg tart and mango juice. Enjoy!<p class="message sent">Mmm, this egg tart is amazing! And the mango juice is so flavorful. You really know your stuff.<p class=message>Thank you! I'm glad you like it. If you're interested, I could show you how to make one of our popular pastries next time you come in.<p class="message sent">That would be fantastic! I would love to learn some new baking skills.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Thanks for coming in today, and have a great afternoon.<p class="message sent">You too! I'll be back soon for more delicious treats.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7a1482d5-641b-4ca5-b154-cb6ca8e3e34d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
