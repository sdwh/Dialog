So, you're a game developer?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. I specialize in puzzle games.<p class=message>Nice! I'm actually a computer gamer and I love puzzles.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's cool. We're currently designing a new puzzle game. Would you like to hear about it?<p class=message>Absolutely! I'm all ears.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. It's called "Mind Maze". Players have to solve various puzzles to escape a virtual maze.<p class=message>Interesting! What kind of puzzles?<p class="message sent">We have all sorts of puzzles - from cryptograms to Sudoku to visual puzzles.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds challenging. How many levels will there be?<p class="message sent">There will be over 100 levels, each one more difficult than the last.<p class=message>I'm definitely going to check it out. When will it be released?<p class="message sent">We're aiming to release it in a few months. But we're still in the testing phase.<p class=message>Well, good luck with the testing. I can't wait to try it out!<p class="message sent">Thanks! We're actually looking for beta testers. Would you be interested?<p class=message>Absolutely. Count me in!<p class="message sent">Great! We'll email you the details. Do you have any suggestions for the game?<p class=message>Hmm, how about incorporating some teamwork puzzles where players have to collaborate to solve them?<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We'll definitely consider it.<p class=message>Awesome! Thanks for letting me suggest that. Can't wait to see the final product.<p class="message sent">No problem. And thanks for showing interest in our game.
