I heard we'll be using ASP.NET Razor Pages for the development. Are you familiar with it?<p class=message>Yeah, I've worked with Razor Pages before. It's a pretty neat framework if you're into C# and .NET coding.<p class="message sent">I'm actually more of a Java person, but I guess it's always good to learn something new. What are the benefits of using Razor Pages?<p class=message>Well, for starters, it's easier to maintain and update since the structure is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The Razor syntax also makes it simpler to write codes and markup together.<p class="message sent">That sounds promising. But what about the cons?<p class=message>Hmm, I'd say it may take some time to get used to if you're not familiar with C#. Also, it may require some additional configurations for certain functionalities.<p class="message sent">I see. Do you think we'll be able to deliver this project on time?<p class=message>Definitely! With the right team collaboration and effective project management, we can surely meet the deadline.<p class="message sent">Great to hear that. By the way, do you have any recommendations for learning more about razor pages?<p class=message>Sure, there are lots of great resources out there, like the official Microsoft docs and online courses. You can also check out some code samples on GitHub.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the suggestions. I can't wait to get started with this project!<p class=message>Me too! Let's make this website as awesome as it can be.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d5617f25-3979-4bd6-b584-96097a65abde.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
