Are we prepared for the rush tonight?<p class="message sent">Don't worry, boss. We've got plenty of meat marinated and ready to go. Plus, our grill is hot and ready for action.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm excited for the customers to try our Japanese-style grilled meats. It's always a hit.<p class="message sent">I agree. Our yakitori is a fan favorite. Have you tried our tsukune yet? It's a must-try for anyone who loves Japanese cuisine.<p class=message>I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but with all the positive feedback we've been getting, I'll definitely have to try some soon.<p class="message sent">You won't be disappointed! Our secret blend of ground chicken and spices make it one of our best sellers.<p class=message>Good to hear. Let me know if we need to restock anything. I'll go make sure we have enough beer and sake for our customers.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, boss. And don't forget the dipping sauce for the yakitori!<p class=message>I won't forget. I know how important it is to have the right condiments. That's what takes a good meal to a great one.<p class="message sent">Exactly. It's all about the little details. Speaking of which, have you seen the new plates we got in?<p class=message>No, I haven't had a chance. Let me take a look. Wow, these are beautiful! They really complement the colors of the meat.<p class="message sent">Yes, they're great for presentation. It's all about the full sensory experience, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. That's what sets us apart from other vendors here. Our food not only tastes great but looks beautiful too!<p class="message sent">And the smell...you can almost smell the smoke from the grill all the way over here!<p class=message>That's the power of good food, my friend. Let's keep this energy up and make sure our customers leave happy and satisfied.<p class="message sent">You got it, boss. Let's start grilling and make tonight a success!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=96b040e0-d7bf-4b7f-8402-2ea88a0aba61.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
