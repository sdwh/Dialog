What can I get for you?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Just passing by and couldn't resist the aroma of your grilled fish. I would love to try something new tonight.<p class=message>That sounds great! We have a special seasoning blend that we use on our fish that really brings out the flavor. Would you like to try that?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely! And to go with it, what kind of beer would you recommend?<p class=message>Well, luckily we have a beer expert here with us tonight. This is B, our local beer brewer.<p class="message sent">Hello! Nice to meet you. With your grilled fish, I would suggest a light beer with a crisp finish. It won't overpower the delicious flavors of the fish.<p class="message sent">Do you have anything like that on tap?<p class=message>We do actually. I think our Pilsner would be a good match. It's light, crisp, and has a subtle bitterness that would complement the fish really nicely.<p class="message sent">Perfect, I'll take a Pilsner and the grilled fish with your special seasoning.<p class=message>Excellent choice. Would you like anything else with your order?<p class="message sent">Actually, maybe just a side of your garlic aioli dipping sauce. I find it goes well with both fish and beer.<p class=message>Sure thing, I'll bring that right out for you. Anything else I can assist you with?<p class="message sent">No, that's it for me. Looking forward to trying your specialties!<p class=message>Well, I'm glad you stopped by! Enjoy your meal, and let me know if you need anything else. It's always a pleasure to collaborate with talented people like ourselves in Clarke Quay.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, cheers to that!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=acf2a3e0-9f32-49a5-a2da-fcee6d9f7c21.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
