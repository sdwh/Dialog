I'm the lead auditor for the ISO 27001 audit. My name is Jack.<p class="message sent">Hello Jack, I'm the head of the IT department. Nice to meet you.<p class=message>Nice to meet you too! Before we begin, can I just say that your office looks amazing with all these cool gadgets.<p class="message sent">Thank you! We try to keep up with the latest tech trends.<p class=message>I can tell. Alright, let's get started. Can you show me your information security policy?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Here it is. Do you need a coffee or tea while you go through it?<p class=message>Oh, that's very kind of you. A cup of tea would be great, thank you.<p class="message sent">No problem. I'll just pop down to the coffee shop on the corner. Do you prefer English Breakfast or Earl Grey?<p class=message>Earl Grey, please. Thank you so much!<p class="message sent">You're welcome. Be right back!<p class="message sent">Alright, here's your tea. Sorry for the wait.<p class=message>No worries at all. This is delicious. Now, back to the audit. Can you tell me more about how you manage system access control?<p class="message sent">Of course. We have a strict process in place for granting and revoking access privileges. We also have regular reviews to ensure that access is still necessary and justified.<p class=message>That's great to hear. And how about your incident management process?<p class="message sent">We have a dedicated team that responds to all reported incidents promptly. We also conduct root cause analyses for all incidents and implement corrective actions to prevent them from happening again.<p class=message>Excellent. Lastly, can you explain your training and awareness program for information security?<p class="message sent">Yes, we provide regular training sessions for all employees to raise awareness of information security risks and best practices. We also conduct simulated phishing exercises to test our employees' awareness and readiness.<p class=message>Impressive. It's clear that your team takes information security seriously. This audit has been a pleasure. Thank you for your time today.<p class="message sent">Thank you for coming in, Jack. Do let me know if you need anything else.
