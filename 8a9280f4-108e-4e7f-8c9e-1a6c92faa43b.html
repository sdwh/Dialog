Do you mind if I sit upfront? I get carsick if I sit at the back.<p class="message sent">Of course, please feel free to sit in the front seat. So, where are you headed today?<p class=message>I'm heading to Osaka. It's my first time there. Have you been there before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. Osaka is a bustling city with lots of amazing food options. I highly recommend trying Okonomiyaki, a savoury pancake with various toppings.<p class=message>That sounds delicious! Do you have any other recommendations?<p class="message sent">Definitely try Takoyaki, a ball-shaped snack with diced octopus inside. And if you want to satisfy your sweet tooth, try mochi, a sweet, chewy ball made from sticky rice.<p class=message>Wow, thanks for the suggestions! I can't wait to try them. By the way, do you have any favourite songs you like to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">Yes, I actually love listening to classic rock like Led Zeppelin and The Beatles. How about you?<p class=message>I like listening to pop songs like Adele and Ed Sheeran. Speaking of Ed Sheeran, have you heard his new album?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. He's such a phenomenal artist. It's amazing how he can create such beautiful songs with just his guitar and voice.<p class=message>I completely agree. I have all his albums, and I can't wait to see him in concert one day.<p class="message sent">Maybe someday you will. You never know what the future has in store for you.<p class=message>That's true. By the way, how much longer do we have until we reach Osaka?<p class="message sent">We're almost there. We should arrive in about 15 minutes, depending on traffic. Is there anywhere specific you'd like me to drop you off?<p class=message>Actually, if you don't mind, could you drop me off at Dotonbori? I've heard it's a lively area with lots of street food and entertainment.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Dotonbori is a great place to visit. You'll have a fantastic time!<p class=message>Thanks so much for the ride and the recommendations. I really appreciate it.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Have a great time in Osaka!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8a8c4397-da1d-4247-8cf2-5dd0f1b89191.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
