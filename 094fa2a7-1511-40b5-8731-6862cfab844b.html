How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too, Chef A! I'm feeling great, thank you. The sun is shining and the smell of fresh bread is in the air, what more could I ask for?<p class=message>I hear you! I've been prepping some delicious fillings for our croissants today. Have you started on the dough yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's coming along nicely but I still need to wait for it to rise a bit more. What about your ingredients? I hope you have enough butter for our puff pastry.<p class=message>Don't worry, I've got us covered. I made sure we have enough butter and it's chilled to the perfect temperature. And speaking of puff pastry, have you tried the fruit tarts we made yesterday? They were a hit with the customers.<p class="message sent">Yes, they were incredible. The combination of the flaky crust and the fresh fruits was simply heavenly. I bet our customers will be asking for more today.<p class=message>I'm sure of it. That's why I'm also preparing some savory pastries for those who prefer a more hearty breakfast. My ham and cheese croissants are always a crowd pleaser.<p class="message sent">You know what else is a crowd pleaser? Our cinnamon rolls. I remember one lady told me they are the best she's ever had.<p class=message>High praise indeed! And she's not wrong, if I do say so myself. Our secret ingredient really takes them to the next level.<p class="message sent">Ah, yes. I remember you promising to share the secret with me one day.<p class=message>Well, let's just say it involves a certain type of spice and a lot of love. Not everyone can handle the heat, you know.<p class="message sent">(Laughs) I see what you did there. Alright, I'll have to wait for that secret to be revealed. But in the meantime, let's concentrate on making some delicious bread and pastries for our customers.<p class=message>Agreed. I can't wait to see the smiles on their faces when they take the first bite. Let's get baking!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=094cd417-d69e-456f-938f-4f6990cddfae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
