How was your stay with us?<p class=message>It was great, thank you. The room was nice and the service was excellent.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that. Did you have a chance to try our restaurant or pool?<p class=message>Yes, we had dinner at the restaurant and it was amazing. And we also enjoyed the pool a lot!<p class="message sent">That's wonderful to hear. Did you encounter any issues during your stay that we could improve on?<p class=message>Actually, yes. The air conditioning was a bit too cold in the room.<p class="message sent">I'm sorry about that. We'll make a note of it for future improvements.<p class=message>No worries, it didn't affect our stay too much. So, how long will it take to check out?<p class="message sent">It should only take a few minutes. I'll just need you to hand me your room key and settle any outstanding charges.<p class=message>Okay, sounds simple enough. Do you prefer cash or card?<p class="message sent">We accept both, whichever is easier for you. How was your trip back home?<p class=message>It was smooth, thanks for asking. Although, I'm not looking forward to getting back to work tomorrow.<p class="message sent">I hear you. But at least you got to enjoy a relaxing weekend away, right?<p class=message>Absolutely, it was much needed. Thanks for your help with the checkout.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, enjoy the rest of your day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=07bbe176-5828-4371-80c2-f17eed42441f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
