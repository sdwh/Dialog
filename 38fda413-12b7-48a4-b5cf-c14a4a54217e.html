How's it going?<p class="message sent">It's going well! How about you, A?<p class=message>Pretty good, thanks. So, let's discuss the progress plan for the first half of the year. What do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">Well, for January, we can aim to complete the basic framework of the project. Then for February, we can focus on developing some core functionalities.<p class=message>Sounds like a good plan. And for March?<p class="message sent">March can be for testing and debugging the features we've developed so far. And then for April, we can work on enhancing the user interface.<p class=message>Yes, that should be a priority. How about May and June?<p class="message sent">For May, we should prepare for a soft launch and start gathering user feedback. And for June, depending on the feedback, we can make adjustments and finalize the project.<p class=message>I agree, that's a solid plan. By the way, have you tried that new lunch place down the street?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class=message>Yeah, I tried it yesterday and it was amazing! We should grab lunch there sometime.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! And speaking of plans, do you have anything fun planned for the weekend?<p class=message>Actually, I'm thinking of taking a hike up the nearby mountain. What about you?<p class="message sent">I might catch up on some gaming. Have you played the new game that just came out?<p class=message>No, I haven't had the chance to yet. Is it worth checking out?<p class="message sent">Definitely! It's a lot of fun. Well, it looks like we have some work ahead of us, but at least we have delicious food and fun games to look forward to!<p class=message>That's right, let's make it a productive and enjoyable first half of the year!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=38fb20aa-7504-42cf-93b6-5bcaa9150dbb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
