The display looks great with all these wonderful pastries.<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too! Thank you, we just finished baking them fresh this morning.<p class=message>Impressive! By the way, which of your coffee drinks would best go with this strawberry shortcake?<p class="message sent">I would recommend our medium roast coffee which has fruity notes that would complement the cake.<p class=message>That surely sounds delicious! And perhaps a cappuccino would pair well with this chocolate éclair?<p class="message sent">Spot on! The bitterness of the espresso will balance the sweetness of the éclair perfectly.<p class=message>Perfect! Do you have any new creations you’re working on that you’re excited about?<p class="message sent">Well, we’re currently working on a new latte that combines caramel and hazelnut flavors that will be available soon.<p class=message>That sounds fantastic! I can’t wait to try it. And you know what? You guys won't believe it. I just got an order for 30 croissants!<p class="message sent">Wow! That’s a lot! I hope you have enough butter and flour to make that many croissants!<p class=message>Don’t worry, we have everything we need. You know what they say, no croissant left behind!<p class="message sent">That’s hilarious! You are a great baker and a comedian too. You never cease to amaze me.<p class=message>You’re too kind! Now let’s get to work and make sure our customers leave here with a smile on their faces!<p class="message sent">Absolutely, let's give them the best coffee and pastry experience they've ever had. Let’s do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=869bb26c-0d10-4111-b411-8c5b5296110b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
