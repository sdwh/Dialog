They now offer room service and laundry, isn't that cool?<p class="message sent">Really? I didn't know that. I might consider staying there next time I travel.<p class=message>Yeah, it's perfect for people who are always on-the-go and need some extra help.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Speaking of which, do they have a menu available for room service?<p class=message>Of course! They have a variety of options, from breakfast to dinner, and you can order anytime you want.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. What about laundry service? Do they have it on-site?<p class=message>Yes, they do. You can leave your clothes at the front desk before 9AM and they'll have it cleaned and delivered back to your room by the end of the day.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's convenient. I might have to take advantage of that.<p class=message>You should! Especially if you're traveling for work and don't have time to do laundry yourself.<p class="message sent">That's true. Do you know if they charge extra for those services?<p class=message>From what I know, prices vary depending on what you order. But I think it's reasonably priced for the convenience they offer.<p class="message sent">Good to know. I hate going out and finding somewhere to eat after a long day of traveling.<p class=message>Same here. That's why I always try to choose hotels that have good room service.<p class="message sent">Yeah, now I see why. It's way more relaxing to stay in and not have to worry about anything.<p class=message>Absolutely. And the best part is you can still get great service without leaving your room!<p class="message sent">You're right. I'm sold! I think I'll check out that hotel next time I'm in town.<p class=message>Great idea! Let me know how it goes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e2f4f1b3-f297-4fd7-81ce-03c172a768ef.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
