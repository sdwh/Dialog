It's all about keeping sensitive information secure.<p class=message>Exactly! And do you know what the main objectives are?<p class="message sent">I believe it's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.<p class=message>Bingo! You're on a roll, B.<p class="message sent">Haha, thanks A. So why are you interested in ISO 27001?<p class=message>Well, I work for a company that handles a lot of confidential data, so I want to make sure we're staying compliant.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. We have to make sure we're keeping the hackers at bay!<p class=message>Yes, that's definitely one of the biggest challenges. Have you ever had to deal with a security breach?<p class="message sent">Thankfully, no. But I know it's a huge risk for any company today.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's important to have a plan in place in case something happens. Do you know about the risk assessment process?<p class="message sent">I'm not entirely sure. Can you explain it to me?<p class=message>Sure thing. It's basically a way to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities in your system so you can mitigate them.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. That sounds really important.<p class=message>Definitely. It's better to be proactive than reactive when it comes to security.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I agree. So what tools or technologies do you use to keep your company's data secure?<p class=message>We rely on firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption.<p class="message sent">Good choices. Encryption is especially important these days with the rise of cyber attacks.<p class=message>Absolutely. And we also have regular security audits to make sure everything is up to par.<p class="message sent">Sounds like your company takes security seriously.<p class=message>We definitely do. It's too important not to!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4015fdc5-c340-4ee8-a37e-a155672a19c6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
