It looks like we've got quite the menu to prepare today.<p class="message sent">Yes, indeed. We want to make sure our customers have a taste of the local delicacies like the pig's trotters with noodles and pineapple cake.<p class=message>Ah, those are some of the classics! It'll be my pleasure to cook up a storm in the kitchen.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! We pride ourselves on the quality of our food, so I know you'll do us proud.<p class=message>Of course! Speaking of which, have you tried any of the snacks here in the area?<p class="message sent">Oh, absolutely. I'm a big fan of the oyster omelettes and the pan-fried buns.<p class=message>Yum! I'll have to give those a try sometime. But for now, let's focus on preparing these dishes.<p class="message sent">Definitely. How about we start by preparing the noodles for the pig's trotters?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Do we have all the ingredients we need?<p class="message sent">Yes, the noodles are already cooked and the trotters have been braising for a few hours.<p class=message>Perfect. I'll start by saut√©ing some garlic and ginger to give the dish some extra flavor.<p class="message sent">Excellent. And while you do that, I'll prepare the pineapple cakes for baking.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I'm excited to taste the finished products!<p class="message sent">Me too! And with your skills in the kitchen, I know they'll be delicious.<p class=message>You flatter me too much!<p class="message sent">Just telling it like it is. Hey, have you heard the one about the chef who burnt his ear?<p class=message>No, I don't think so.<p class="message sent">He heard dinner was almost ready!
