Are they good?<p class=message>I would say they're more than good, they're amazing. They have a secret sauce that just takes them to the next level.<p class="message sent">Hmm, that sounds interesting. What kind of tacos do you recommend?<p class=message>My personal favourites are the chicken and steak tacos. But if you're feeling adventurous, they also have a taco with cactus in it.<p class="message sent">Cactus? I never thought of using that in a taco before.<p class=message>Yeah, it may sound weird but it actually tastes really good. And it's also good for you, so it's a win-win.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'll have to try it next time I'm in the mood for Mexican food. How about the drinks? Anything special?<p class=message>Oh, you have to try their margaritas. They make them fresh and they're so delicious.<p class="message sent">I am sold. Let's go to that restaurant for lunch tomorrow.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan to me. Just be prepared to be blown away by their tacos.<p class="message sent">Speaking of tacos, have you ever tried to make them at home?<p class=message>Actually, I have. It's not that hard if you have the right ingredients and recipe.<p class="message sent">Really? Maybe you could teach me how to make them sometime.<p class=message>Sure, I'd be happy to. But just remember, it's hard to beat the ones at that restaurant.<p class="message sent">I hear you loud and clear, but it doesn't hurt to try and make them ourselves.<p class=message>Very true. Who knows, maybe we'll discover a secret sauce of our own and open up our own taco stand.<p class="message sent">Haha, that would be amazing. I can already imagine the long lines of customers waiting to try our tacos.<p class=message>Dream big my friend, dream big. Let's start with perfecting our recipe first.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7967ad4f-ea09-4848-b3d9-13f4e9f85816.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
