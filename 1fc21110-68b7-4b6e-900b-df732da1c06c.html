We'll take good care of you. Now, let's get started.<p class="message sent">(jokes) As long as you don't forget any tools inside of me afterwards!<p class=message>(laughs) That would definitely be a problem. Rest assured, we have a checklist and a team that will make sure that doesn't happen.<p class="message sent">(smiling) That's good to know. I don't want to become a walking toolbox.<p class=message>(grinning) That would make for an interesting story, though. How did you lose all that weight? Oh, I just had a bunch of tools inside of me!<p class="message sent">(laughs) I don't think I want that to be my claim to fame. Let's just stick to a successful surgery.<p class=message>Agreed. But if we do find anything interesting inside, we'll let you know.<p class="message sent">(jokingly) Please don't find a toy surprise or anything like that.<p class=message>(laughs) Don't worry, we won't. We'll make sure to be thorough.<p class="message sent">(serious) Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.<p class=message>(smiling) Anytime. Now, let's get started. We're going to give you a better quality of life.<p class="message sent">(smiling and nodding) I'm ready.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1fc057da-a4e1-4c0f-b5c9-775a16889586.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
