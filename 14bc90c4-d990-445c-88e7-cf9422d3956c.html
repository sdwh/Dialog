I heard you're working on the latest mobile game. Can you give me a sneak peek?<p class="message sent">Hey A, good to see you too! Of course, I'd be happy to show you what we have so far. It's a puzzle game that uses augmented reality technology.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds really cool! How did you come up with the idea?<p class="message sent">Well, I was inspired by how popular AR games like Pok√©mon Go became. I thought it would be a great opportunity to create a fun and challenging puzzle game that uses the same technology.<p class=message>That's a smart move. So what's the objective of the game?<p class="message sent">The player has to navigate their way through a series of mazes by moving around in the real world. The puzzles are designed to test their problem-solving skills and strategic thinking.<p class=message>Sounds like my kind of game! When will it be released?<p class="message sent">We're aiming for a release in about two months. We're putting a lot of effort into making sure it's polished and bug-free before we launch it.<p class=message>I'm sure it'll be worth the wait. How long have you been working on this project so far?<p class="message sent">We've been working on it for about six months now. It's been a challenging process, but it's also been a lot of fun.<p class=message>It definitely sounds like a lot of work, but I'm sure it's rewarding to see your ideas come to life.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's always exciting to see people playing and enjoying the games we create.<p class=message>Well, I can't wait to try it out myself. Do you need any beta testers?<p class="message sent">(laughs) We actually have a pool of beta testers already, but I'll see if I can sneak you in there.<p class=message>(laughs) Thanks, that would be awesome! I'm eagerly looking forward to the release.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I appreciate your support. I'll keep you updated on any new developments.<p class=message>Sounds good. Thanks for chatting with me about it, B. See you soon!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always great to catch up.
