What kind of fish are you usually able to get?<p class="message sent">We have a variety of seafood available, from tuna and salmon to swordfish and cod. It really depends on the season and what the fishermen have caught.<p class=message>I see. How do you cook your seafood dishes to make them taste amazing?<p class="message sent">We cook them using simple ingredients and techniques that accentuate the flavors of the fish. Grilling, poaching, or frying are some of the methods we use.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds delicious!

It's definitely worth a try!<p class=message>That sounds fantastic! I'll definitely have to try it out. Do you have any tips for cooking seafood at home?<p class="message sent">Always buy your seafood as fresh as possible and handle it with care. Don't overcook it and keep the seasoning simple to let the natural flavors shine through.<p class=message>Thank you for the advice!
