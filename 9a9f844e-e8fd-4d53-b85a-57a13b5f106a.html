We've made some progress on the coding and we're on track to meet our deadline.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Are there any specific areas where you need more support from the rest of the team?<p class="message sent">Not really, we've been able to handle most things in-house. But we could definitely use some snacks, the long hours are starting to take a toll on our stomachs.<p class=message>Haha, I know the feeling. How about we order some pizza for everyone tonight, would that be good?<p class="message sent">Ah, you know how to make our hearts sing, A. Pizza sounds perfect.<p class=message>Awesome, I'll take care of that. By the way, do you have any updates on the user interface design?<p class="message sent">Yes, we've been collaborating with the design team and they've come up with some really cool concepts. We're excited to start implementing them soon.<p class=message>Excellent. And how about, the testing phase? Are we on schedule for that?<p class="message sent">Yes, we've got a good plan in place for testing and we should be able to stick to it.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. Keep up the good work, B, and I'll catch up with you later.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. You're always such a helpful assistant.<p class=message>Happy to be of service.
