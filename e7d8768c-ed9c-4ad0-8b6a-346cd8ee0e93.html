But we need to ensure accessibility for all voters, including those with disabilities.<p class=message>Absolutely. We could have the option for a braille display and voice commands.<p class="message sent">And we need to make sure our system can't be hacked. We should have a team of cybersecurity experts to prevent any breaches.<p class=message>Agreed. We also need a backup system in case of any technical difficulties.<p class="message sent">Good point. We can have a monitoring system that detects any issues and switches to the backup system automatically.<p class=message>Additionally, we should have a user-friendly interface to make the voting process easy and quick.<p class="message sent">Right, people don't want to spend too much time figuring out how to vote. Let's make it intuitive for everyone.<p class=message>Also, we can provide a confirmation receipt for each vote casted to ensure that votes are recorded correctly.<p class="message sent">And finally, let's make sure that the system is ready for peak usage on election day, so we don't face any technical difficulties.<p class=message>Sounds like a solid plan. Let's get to work on building this electronic voting system.<p class="message sent">Yes, let's build a better future for democracy.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e7d86705-3ef4-4b63-a7a7-e5479c00aab6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
