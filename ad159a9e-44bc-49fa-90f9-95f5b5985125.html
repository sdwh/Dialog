But I'm ready for it!<p class=message>Me too. So, what's the first drink on your menu today?<p class="message sent">I think I'll start with a latte, extra foam, and a shot of caramel. How about you?<p class=message>A cappuccino with a dash of cinnamon, please. I just love the aroma of coffee and cinnamon mixed together.<p class="message sent">That sounds good. Hey, did you hear about the customer who asked for a "half-caf, triple shot, low-fat, no-foam latte"?<p class=message>No way! How did you even fit all that on the cup?<p class="message sent">I know, right? I just wrote "Mind. Blown." on the cup and called out the order.<p class=message>(laughs) You're too funny. Speaking of funny, did you watch that new comedy on Netflix?<p class="message sent">Which one? There are so many!<p class=message>The one about the barista who makes the world's worst coffee? I can relate to that one.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, that's hilarious. But seriously, we both make great coffee!<p class=message>Agreed. And don't forget our delicious croissants and muffins. They're perfect for those who can't decide between a caffeine boost or a sugar high.<p class="message sent">(smiles) You make a good point. Alright, let's get to work then. The sooner we start, the sooner we'll finish.<p class=message>Absolutely. We'll work together like coffee and cream!<p class="message sent">That's the spirit!
