How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Good afternoon. I'm quite hungry, but not sure what to order. What do you recommend?<p class=message>Our chef recommends our shrimp scampi pasta or our grilled chicken Caesar salad. Both are very popular among our guests.<p class="message sent">Hmm, the shrimp scampi does sound pretty tasty. But I also see you have some sandwiches listed here. Which one do you recommend the most?<p class=message>The club sandwich is a classic, but our turkey and avocado sandwich is also very good. Which one catches your eye?<p class="message sent">I think I'll go with the club sandwich. Can I also get a side of fries with that?<p class=message>Absolutely! And would you like something to drink with your meal? We have a wide variety of options including sodas, juices, and alcoholic beverages.<p class="message sent">I think I'll just stick with water for now. Thank you.<p class=message>Not a problem. Your order will be right out. Is there anything else I can get for you?<p class="message sent">Actually, I wanted to ask you about the hotel's amenities. Are there any activities or attractions nearby that you would recommend?<p class=message>Definitely! We have a beautiful pool and a fitness center that you can use as a guest of the hotel. You can also easily take a short walk to the beach or the shopping district.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. I'll have to check those out after lunch.<p class=message>You won't be disappointed. Our guests always love the facilities.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your help. You've been very kind!<p class=message>It's my pleasure. Enjoy your meal and let me know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d133f924-add3-4af6-a75b-fe6abb72019f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
