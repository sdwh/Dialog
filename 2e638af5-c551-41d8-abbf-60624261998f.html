It seems like we can never be too careful with our online security.<p class=message>Definitely. That's why I was thinking we should hire a security engineer like yourself to help us prevent those attacks.<p class="message sent">Well, I'm flattered but I'm actually a network security expert. But don't worry, we can still work together to protect our company.<p class=message>Great! So, what are some of the measures we can take to prevent DDoS attacks?<p class="message sent">Well, we can start by implementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems, as well as using load balancers to distribute traffic evenly.<p class=message>That sounds like a lot of work. Can't we just ask our IT guy to take care of it?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, it's not that simple. It requires constant monitoring and updating to stay ahead of attackers.<p class=message>Wow, I guess we really need someone like you to keep us safe.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, I've got your back. With my expertise and your company's commitment to security, we can prevent DDoS attacks and keep our online presence secure.<p class=message>That's a relief. Thanks for your help, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's what I'm here for. Just remember, security is everyone's responsibility.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2e6298a4-804f-43f4-8f04-3e8ec15117ae.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
