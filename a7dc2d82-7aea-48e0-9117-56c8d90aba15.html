Are we busy tonight?<p class="message sent">Good evening, A. Yes, it looks like we have a full house tonight.<p class=message>Great, then we'll need to work together efficiently to make sure everyone gets their meals on time.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. What's on the menu tonight?<p class=message>We have a special fish dish with a side of garlic mashed potatoes, as well as our famous steak with roasted vegetables.<p class="message sent">Yum, those both sound delicious. I'm sure our customers will love it.<p class=message>I think so too. Have you tried the fish dish before? It's one of my favorites.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. Maybe I'll have to try it myself tonight.<p class=message>You should! And while you're at it, make sure to save some room for our dessert of the day - it's a rich chocolate cake.<p class="message sent">Now you're making me hungry! Speaking of desserts, have you heard about the new bakery that just opened down the street? They have amazing pastries.<p class=message>Really? I love a good pastry. I'll have to check it out sometime.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Oh, and make sure to save some garlic mashed potatoes for me. I can't resist them.<p class=message>No problem, B. I'll make sure there's plenty to go around.
