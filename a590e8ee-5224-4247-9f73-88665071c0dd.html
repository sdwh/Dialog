I see you're getting quite the rise out of that dough over there.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! Yes, this sourdough is really coming along nicely. What are you working on today?<p class=message>I've got some croissants and brioche in the oven, and I'm starting on a batch of cinnamon rolls next.<p class="message sent">Ah, cinnamon rolls are always a crowd-pleaser. What's your secret to making them so delicious?<p class=message>Well, I always make sure to use plenty of cinnamon and brown sugar in the filling, and I like to add a bit of nutmeg for extra flavor.<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing. Speaking of flavor, have you tried the new jalape√±o cheddar bread we just added to the menu?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's got a great kick to it, and the cheddar cheese is so tangy. It's already become one of our best sellers.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear it. And how about the bagels? Are they turning out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside?<p class=message>You bet! I boil them first to give them that signature texture, and then bake them until they're golden brown. They're perfect for our breakfast sandwiches.<p class="message sent">You know, A, I think we make a great team. We're like peanut butter and jelly, or...bread and butter.<p class=message>Haha, I couldn't agree more, B. We complement each other perfectly. And speaking of teamwork, do you want to split a pizza for lunch?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's hope we don't get too doughy from all this bread-baking.<p class=message>Agreed. We'll work it off with some extra kneading later. Thanks for being such a great colleague, B.<p class="message sent">You too, A! Let's keep making these delicious breads and pastries together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a5883dbb-519e-450f-8a3f-ca8e1e73006e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
