Can you tell me a little bit about your experience in the hospitality industry?<p class=message>Of course! I've worked as a bellhop at a few different hotels in the past, so I'm familiar with the duties of a porter. I really enjoy working with guests and helping them have a smooth and comfortable stay.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Can you give me an example of a time when you went above and beyond for a guest?<p class=message>Absolutely. One time, a guest had left a valuable item in their room after checking out. I made sure to retrieve it and then personally deliver it to the guest, even though they had already left the hotel. They were extremely grateful and left a great review for our hotel.<p class="message sent">Excellent, it sounds like you have excellent customer service skills. Are you able to lift heavy luggage and stand for extended periods of time?<p class=message>Yes, I am physically able to meet the demands of the job. I pride myself on being a hard worker and going the extra mile whenever necessary.<p class="message sent">That's exactly what we're looking for. Could you also share with me your language abilities, since we have many international guests staying with us?<p class=message>Sure, I'm fluent in English and Spanish, and I have basic knowledge of French and German. I'm always eager to learn more languages and communicate effectively with guests from around the world.<p class="message sent">That's wonderful to hear. Overall, it sounds like you would be a great addition to our team. We will be in touch regarding the next steps of the hiring process.<p class=message>Thank you so much for your time and consideration, I'm really excited about the possibility of working at your hotel. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e035524a-1c39-454f-a443-e896dc7159af.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
