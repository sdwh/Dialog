It’s pretty alarming, right?<p class=message>Definitely. As a cloud operation engineer, I’m starting to worry about the security of our clients’ financial information.<p class="message sent">As a network security engineer, I share the same concern. That’s why we need to ensure that our security protocols are top-notch.<p class=message>Absolutely. What measures do you think we should take to prevent these breaches from happening to our company?<p class="message sent">Well, we need to make sure that our firewalls and VPNs are updated and regularly checked for any vulnerabilities. We should also have a strong password policy.<p class=message>Speaking of passwords, I heard that “123456” is still the most commonly used password. Can you believe that?<p class="message sent">Ha! That’s ridiculous. We need to educate our clients on the importance of creating strong and unique passwords.<p class=message>Agreed. We should also implement two-factor authentication as an added layer of security.<p class="message sent">That’s perfect. We should also remind our clients to never share their financial information through email or on social media.<p class=message>Right. We need to assure our clients that their information is safe with us by having regular security audits.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we should also have a response plan in case of a security breach. It’s always better to be prepared.<p class=message>Definitely. Well, I guess we’ve got our work cut out for us, but I’m confident that we can handle it.<p class="message sent">Yes, we’ll make sure our clients’ financial information is safe and secure. Let’s do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=520fc3bc-d34c-434b-803e-649db8acf6fc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
