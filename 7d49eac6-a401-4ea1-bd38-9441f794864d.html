I'm knee deep in meat over here. Did you get any interesting orders today?<p class="message sent">Yeah, actually. I had to deliver some alligator meat to a restaurant.<p class=message>Alligator meat? No way! What kind of dishes do they make with that?<p class="message sent">I have no idea, but I'm curious to find out. Maybe we should go check it out!<p class=message>I'm down for that! Speaking of checking things out, have you tried that new food truck that opened up down the street?<p class="message sent">Oh man, don't even get me started. Their tacos are out of this world.<p class=message>I gotta try them. I'm getting tired of eating the same old sandwiches every day for lunch.<p class="message sent">You definitely should. And they have vegetarian options too, in case you're feeling spicy.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm trying to eat a little healthier these days. Hey, have you ever considered becoming a chef yourself?<p class="message sent">Ha, me? I can barely make toast!<p class=message>I don't believe that. You handle food all day, you must be picking up some tips!<p class="message sent">I mean, I do watch a lot of cooking shows on TV...<p class=message>Hey, that's a good start! Who knows, maybe one day you'll be the one delivering your own gourmet meals!<p class="message sent">(laughs) Keep dreaming, A. But I appreciate the vote of confidence. Alright, I gotta get back on the road. See you around!<p class=message>Take care, B. And remember, stay away from any kitchens with alligators!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7d451e7b-4264-485a-9614-246126551f41.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
