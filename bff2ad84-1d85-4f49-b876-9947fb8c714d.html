May I see your ticket and bag, please?<p class="message sent">Sure, here you go. And I'm so excited for tonight's concert!<p class=message>Great! Who's your favorite artist performing tonight?<p class="message sent">Definitely Beyonc√©. I've been a fan of hers for years.<p class=message>Me too! Alright, let me just check your bag. Oh, it looks like you have a water bottle. Unfortunately, we can't allow outside drinks inside the venue.<p class="message sent">Oh, I didn't know that. Can I drink it all now?<p class=message>Sorry, you can't drink it all right now. But if you finish drinking it and leave the empty bottle outside, you can come in.<p class="message sent">Okay, thanks for letting me know. Wait, why are you smelling my bag?<p class=message>Oh, sorry about that. We're just making sure there's no dangerous or prohibited items inside. Safety first!<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. You're doing a great job ensuring everyone's safety.<p class=message>Thank you, sir. Now, please step on this scanner. It's just a routine check.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Wow, this scanner is high-tech.<p class=message>Yes, it detects any metal or suspicious items attached to clothing. You're all good though, nothing to worry about.<p class="message sent">That's a relief. By the way, do you know what time the concert starts?<p class=message>It starts at 7 PM, so you still have a bit of time to grab some snacks or merch before it begins.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the info! I think I'll go look for some food now.<p class=message>You're welcome. And remember, if you have any concerns or questions during the concert, just look for any of us security guards.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! Thanks again for everything.<p class=message>Have fun in there!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bff00f75-ed55-4ecb-872b-8879e6b4c124.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
