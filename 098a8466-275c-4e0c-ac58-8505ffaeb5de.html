How are you today, B?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I'm doing well, thanks! How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain. Another day, another bento box to make. Speaking of which, what's popular today?<p class="message sent">Right now, people seem to really like the chicken teriyaki bento. And for tea, iced green tea with lemon is a hit.<p class=message>Noted. Have you heard about the new trend of adding avocado to bento boxes?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have! I actually tried it out myself and it was pretty tasty. Maybe we should consider adding it to our menu.<p class=message>That's a great idea! We could also do a salmon and avocado option.<p class="message sent">Ooh, I like the sound of that. We could add some wasabi mayonnaise for an extra kick.<p class=message>Great suggestion, B. I love how we both enjoy experimenting with different combinations. It keeps things interesting.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And it's always satisfying when we see our customers enjoying our creations.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's the reason we do what we do. Oh, speaking of which, I think I see a regular customer coming in. He always orders the same thing.<p class="message sent">Let me guess, the tonkatsu bento?<p class=message>You got it. And he's also been buying our iced matcha latte every day.<p class="message sent">Well then, let's not keep him waiting. I'll start making his matcha latte while you make his bento.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. And let's add a green tea mochi for good measure.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Alright, let's get to work!<p class=message>Here you go, sir. Your usual order with a green tea mochi. Enjoy!<p class="message sent">We're happy to hear that. See you tomorrow!<p class=message>Well, that was nice. It's always great to hear positive feedback.<p class="message sent">It is, and it makes all our hard work worth it.<p class=message>Alright, let's keep the orders coming. I have a feeling it's going to be a busy day.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=09875244-8bb5-4918-b3cd-1f3eef8c689a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
