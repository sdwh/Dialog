How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">It's going well, A. What about you? How's the audit process going?<p class=message>It's going good too. I must say, your network security system is quite impressive.<p class="message sent">Thank you. We take security very seriously here.<p class=message>I can tell. It's nice to see a company that is committed to information security.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's important to ensure that our clients' data is safe and secure.<p class=message>Absolutely. Say, have you heard about the latest phishing scam?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's the latest news?<p class=message>Hackers are now sending emails pretending to be the health department, asking people to click on a link to get their Covid vaccine certificate.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a new low. People really need to be vigilant and not fall for these scams.<p class=message>Yes, they do. But you know what they say – prevention is better than cure.<p class="message sent">So true. And speaking of prevention, have you tried our new spam filters? They've been working wonders!<p class=message>Really? That's great to hear. I'll definitely recommend them to our other clients.<p class="message sent">That would be awesome, A. We're always happy to help.<p class=message>Thanks, B. I knew I could count on you. Now, let's get back to some serious auditing!<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do that. But one more thing – have you tried our new coffee machine?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it good?<p class="message sent">It's amazing! Let me show you where it is.<p class=message>Haha, sure. I could do with a good cup of coffee right about now.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=adb7b2d9-3bb9-454d-a8cf-98bfd2ee0f65.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
