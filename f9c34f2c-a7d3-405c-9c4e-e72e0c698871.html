How's everything going? Did you have a good night last night?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! Everything is going well here, and thanks for asking. As for last night, I stayed in and binged watched my favourite show on Netflix.<p class=message>That sounds like a relaxing night. By the way, have you tried the new seafood dish we are serving tonight?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't yet. But it smells amazing! What did you put in it?<p class=message>It's a recipe I learned when I was in France. It's a mix of mussels, clams, and shrimp cooked in white wine and shallots.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds delicious. I'll have to give it a try later.<p class=message>Speaking of France, have you ever been there?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't, but I would love to go someday.<p class=message>Same here. I hear the food is amazing there, especially the pastries and cheese.<p class="message sent">Oh, don't get me started on cheese. I could eat it all day, every day.<p class=message>Speaking of eating, did you bring your lunch today?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. I brought some leftover pasta from last night's dinner. What about you?<p class=message>Actually, I forgot my lunch at home, so I might have to sneak a bite of that pasta later.<p class="message sent">No problem! We can share. But I'm warning you, I put a lot of cheese in it!<p class=message>Oh, that's perfect for me. I'm a cheese addict!<p class="message sent">Well, lucky for you, we have plenty of it here. What's your favorite type of cheese?<p class=message>I love sharp cheddar. It goes well with everything.<p class="message sent">I'm more of a brie person myself. Especially with some crackers and grapes.<p class=message>That sounds like a great snack to enjoy before a seafood dinner.<p class="message sent">Agreed! Hey, speaking of dinner, I think we have some customers waiting for us. Let's get back to work!<p class=message>Right! We can continue our cheese talk later.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f9c32b27-8232-4138-8a01-e939de08aaea.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
