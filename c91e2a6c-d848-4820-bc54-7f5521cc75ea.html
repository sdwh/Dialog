Are you enjoying your visit so far?<p class="message sent">Hi there, thanks for having me! Yes, I'm having a great time exploring all the exhibits.<p class=message>That's wonderful to hear! Is there anything in particular that has caught your interest?<p class="message sent">I really enjoyed the dinosaur exhibit, but I'm really interested in learning more about the history of Melbourne.<p class=message>Ah, yes! We have a fantastic exhibition on Melbourne's Indigenous history. It's a great way to learn about the city's rich cultural past.<p class="message sent">That sounds really interesting. Can you tell me more about it?<p class=message>Certainly! The exhibition covers the stories of the Wurundjeri people, the traditional owners of the land that Melbourne is built on. You'll also get to see some amazing artifacts and learn about the ways of life for Indigenous Australians.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds fascinating. How long has the exhibition been open for?<p class=message>It's been open for a couple of years now, and it's proved to be very popular with visitors. We even have guided tours if you're interested!<p class="message sent">That's great to know. I might have to take you up on that offer!<p class=message>Absolutely! We also have a special exhibition on the history of immigration in Melbourne. It features stories from people who have come from all over the world to make a home here.<p class="message sent">That sounds really interesting too. What kind of artifacts will I be able to see?<p class=message>There are photos, personal belongings, and even some immigration documents. It really brings the stories to life.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to check it out! Do you have any recommendations for other exhibits I should see?<p class=message>If you're interested in science, we have an amazing interactive exhibit on the human body. You can explore different organs, learn about the brain, and even look at your own DNA!<p class="message sent">That sounds really cool. I might have to come back another day to see everything!<p class=message>Definitely! We're open seven days a week, so there's always something new to see.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c919aeaf-b2ef-4c7c-b11e-b8f6a778ab91.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
