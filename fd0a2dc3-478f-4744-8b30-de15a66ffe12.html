How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks. I'm excited to be heading to Nanjing for the first time.<p class="message sent">It's a beautiful city, you'll enjoy it. Are you here for business or pleasure?<p class=message>Actually, it's a little bit of both. I have a conference to attend, but I'm also looking forward to exploring the city.<p class="message sent">That's great. Do you have any specific places in mind that you want to see?<p class=message>Well, I definitely want to visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and the Confucius Temple. And I've heard the food in Nanjing is amazing, so I want to try some local dishes.<p class="message sent">Oh, you'll love the food here. Personally, I recommend the salted duck, it's a local specialty.<p class=message>That sounds delicious, I'll have to try it. So, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving taxis for about 5 years now. It's a great job, I get to meet all sorts of interesting people.<p class=message>I bet. Do you have any crazy taxi stories?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. One time, I had a passenger who wanted to blast heavy metal music the entire ride. It was definitely an interesting experience.<p class=message>Haha, that does sound interesting. What's the craziest thing you've seen happen on the road?<p class="message sent">I once saw a cow crossing the street. That was definitely unexpected.<p class=message>Wow, that must have been quite a sight. Thanks for the ride and for the conversation.<p class="message sent">No problem, I hope you enjoy your time in Nanjing!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fd09b5a5-0212-4c80-9421-6d5ff43f6719.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
