What's up?<p class=message>Well, I was wondering if you knew about the specific requirements for maintenance and updates. It's been a while since I reviewed them.<p class="message sent">Of course! Basically, you need to review and update your information security management system (ISMS) regularly.<p class=message>Got it. And what about the documentation involved?<p class="message sent">You'll want to make sure your documents are up-to-date and accessible to those who need them.<p class=message>Sounds like a lot of work.<p class="message sent">It can be, but it's worth it in the long run. Have you heard of the PDCA cycle?<p class=message>No, what's that?<p class="message sent">It stands for Plan-Do-Check-Act. It's a helpful way to approach the maintenance and updates of your ISMS.<p class=message>Hmm, interesting. I'll have to look into that.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It'll make the process much smoother. And don't forget about employee training too.<p class=message>Right, we need to make sure everyone's aware of the policies and procedures.<p class="message sent">Exactly. It's important to have a strong culture of information security within the organization.<p class=message>Makes sense. Thanks for the tips!<p class="message sent">Anytime! And good luck with the maintenance and updates.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0fb1e70c-5df9-46e1-9164-5bd04a09ddad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
