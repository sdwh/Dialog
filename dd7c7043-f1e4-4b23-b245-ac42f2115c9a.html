How's our progress on the project so far?<p class="message sent">It's going well! We've managed to complete most of the tasks we've set for this week, so that's great news.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear! So what's our plan for next week?<p class="message sent">For next week, we're planning to work on the back-end development and start building the database.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. How many team members do we have working on the back-end?<p class="message sent">We have three developers working on the back-end, and two UI/UX designers working on the front-end.<p class=message>Great, so how are we looking with our deadlines for the upcoming phases of the project?<p class="message sent">We're scheduled to complete the next phase a week ahead of schedule, so we have some breathing room if anything unplanned comes up.<p class=message>That's reassuring. Have you had a chance to review the feedback we received from our stakeholders?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've gone through it and it seems like they're pleased with our progress so far.<p class=message>Awesome, glad to hear it. Do we need any additional resources for next week's tasks?<p class="message sent">We may need to bring on an additional developer to help with the back-end work, but we'll need to assess that further as we get closer to the deadline.<p class=message>Understood. Are there any challenges or obstacles we need to address?<p class="message sent">Not at the moment, but we'll need to monitor our progress and identify any potential roadblocks as we move forward.<p class=message>Okay, thanks for the update, B. Let's touch base again later this week to make sure we're on track.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, A. Thanks for checking in with me.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dd794ad6-773e-41ac-bce8-100177bc1243.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
