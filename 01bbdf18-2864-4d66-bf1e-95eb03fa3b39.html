Have you tried the Caesar salad here?<p class="message sent">Hey! Yes, I just had it for lunch. It's really good!<p class=message>Oh, that's great to hear. What makes it so special?<p class="message sent">I think it's the dressing. It's tangy and creamy at the same time, and it really brings out the flavor of the fresh lettuce.<p class=message>Hmm, interesting. I'm more of a ranch dressing person myself, but maybe I'll give it a try.<p class="message sent">You definitely should! And the croutons add a satisfying crunch to the salad too.<p class=message>I do love a good crouton. Did you get any chicken in your salad?<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. It was grilled to perfection and added some protein to the dish.<p class=message>Sounds like a balanced meal, then. I might have to add some chicken to mine as well.<p class="message sent">Definitely! Plus, the dish is quite filling, so you won't feel hungry afterwards.<p class=message>That's a big plus for me. What do you think about the portion size?<p class="message sent">It's just right for me. I don't like to feel too full after a meal, but I also don't want to feel like I need to eat again in 30 minutes.<p class=message>Agreed. Well, you've convinced me to give it a try. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Let me know how you like it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=01b3c946-96e2-44ec-b1fc-b1c53755206e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
