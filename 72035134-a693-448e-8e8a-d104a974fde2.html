So, let's talk about the course schedule for next semester. Any suggestions?<p class="message sent">Yes, I was thinking of adding a new elective course on the History of American Music.

I have several guest speakers and musicians who are willing to come and give lectures.<p class=message>Excellent. And how about the scheduling? Do you have any specific days and times in mind?<p class="message sent">I recommend offering the course on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, as it seems to fit well with the other classes.<p class=message>Alright, I will add it to the list of courses to consider. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class="message sent">Yes, I think it's time to update the curriculum for the Introduction to Computer Science course.

I will make sure to assign the task to the appropriate faculty member.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Director. I also want to commend you on the success of the new student mentoring program.
