How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was good, thanks for asking. I spent most of it studying for your exam next week.<p class=message>Ah, very responsible of you. Have you been keeping track of your study time?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been using an app to track my study time. I'm up to 10 hours so far.<p class=message>That's impressive! Don't forget to take breaks and give your brain a rest. Maybe try taking a walk or doing some yoga.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. I've been sitting for so long I think my chair and I have officially merged into one being.<p class=message>(laughs) Ah, the joys of sitting for long periods of time. Just remember to drink water and stretch periodically.<p class="message sent">I definitely will. Hey, did you hear about the new coffee shop that opened up down the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's so special about it?<p class="message sent">They have a drink called the "Zombie" that's supposed to be really strong. I'm thinking about trying it, but I don't want to end up like the name suggests.<p class=message>(laughs) I'm sure you'll be fine. Just make sure you don't have it right before class starts.<p class="message sent">Definitely not. I'll save it for after class. Maybe it'll help me power through my study sessions.<p class=message>Hey, whatever works! Just remember to take care of yourself and don't forget to have fun too.<p class="message sent">Will do, thank you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a02b0ff-881f-4a11-9643-5f86f3103c23.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
