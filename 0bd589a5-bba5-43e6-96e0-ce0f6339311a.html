It's been a while since we last met. How are you doing?<p class="message sent">I'm good, thanks for asking. How about you, A? I heard you finished writing your new book.<p class=message>Yeah, I did. It's a romantic comedy set in London.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting! So, have you thought about which publisher to approach?<p class=message>Not really. I was hoping you could help me out with that. You're the expert, after all.<p class="message sent">Of course, I'd be happy to help. But first, we need to discuss the book's target audience and marketing strategy.<p class=message>That's a good point. I was thinking of targeting young adults who enjoy light-hearted stories.<p class="message sent">That's a good start. Now, let's brainstorm some marketing ideas. We could do a social media campaign and host a book launch event.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. I could even dress up as one of the characters and do a reading.<p class="message sent">That would certainly bring some added excitement to the launch. Also, we need to talk about the book's cover design.<p class=message>I was hoping for something that captures the essence of London, like the iconic red phone box.<p class="message sent">That could really work! Let me talk to our design team and see what they come up with.<p class=message>Thanks, B. You're really making my dream of being a published author come true.<p class="message sent">Don't mention it. It's always a pleasure working with you, A. I'm sure this book will be a hit!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0bcb0609-106a-45b7-a2a5-6cd935a67f2a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
