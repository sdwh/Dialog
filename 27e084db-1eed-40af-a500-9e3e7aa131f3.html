I'm a food processing worker. I see you're the owner of this candy shop.<p class="message sent">Hello! Yes, that's right. We specialize in traditional Chaozhou candies.<p class=message>That's amazing! I've always been curious about how these candies are made.<p class="message sent">It's a delicate process. We use a mixture of sugar, maltose, and water to create a sticky dough, which we then shape into various designs before drying them out.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds quite labor-intensive. How long does the entire process take?<p class="message sent">It varies, but on average it takes about 5-6 hours from start to finish.<p class=message>That's dedication! What's your most popular candy?<p class="message sent">Our peanut candy is definitely a crowd-pleaser. People love the combination of sweet and nutty flavors.<p class=message>Mmm, that sounds delicious. Can I try some?<p class="message sent">Of course! Here you go.<p class=message>(takes a bite) This is amazing! The texture is so satisfyingly chewy, and the peanut flavor really stands out.<p class="message sent">I'm glad you like it! It's definitely a classic.<p class=message>Do you have any other unique candies that are particular to Chaozhou?<p class="message sent">Yes! We have 'chi jin gao', which is a steamed cake made with sticky rice flour and brown sugar. It's often eaten during the Mid-Autumn festival.<p class=message>That sounds delightful. Well, it was great learning about these traditional candies from you. Thank you for the sweet treat!<p class="message sent">You're welcome, thanks for visiting.
