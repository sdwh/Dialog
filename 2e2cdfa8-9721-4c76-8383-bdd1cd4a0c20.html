It's their specialty.<p class="message sent">Yes, I did. It was pretty good. The combination of beets, cabbage, and beef was interesting.<p class=message>I agree. I also found the sour cream on top added a nice touch of creaminess to the dish.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And did you know borsch is originally from Ukraine?<p class=message>Oh, really? I thought it was a Russian dish.<p class="message sent">Well, it's actually both. It's a common dish in both countries and they both claim it as their own.<p class=message>That's interesting. Have you ever tried making borsch at home?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But my grandma used to make it all the time. I should ask her for her recipe.<p class=message>That's a good idea. It would be fun to try making it ourselves.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And maybe we could add our own twist to the recipe.<p class=message>Yes, like adding more vegetables or using a different type of meat.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. I can't wait to try it out.<p class=message>Me too. But for now, let's enjoy this delicious borsch. Cheers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2e2708e1-4c04-4dea-a873-309fb2a5d41b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
