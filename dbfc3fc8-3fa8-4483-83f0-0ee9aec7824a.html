How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. So, I hear we're working on implementing an automated software deployment process. Any thoughts on that?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I think it's a great idea. It'll save us a lot of time and effort in the long run.<p class=message>Definitely. Do you have any experience with automation tools?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've worked with a few different ones. Have you?<p class=message>A little bit, but I'm definitely looking to learn more. What do you think the biggest benefit of automation is?<p class="message sent">Well, besides the time and effort we save, it also reduces the risk of human error. Plus, it allows us to consistently deploy software across different environments.<p class=message>That's a good point. I also think it'll lead to better collaboration between different teams.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And it'll let us focus on more important things, like developing new features.<p class=message>Exactly. Hey, have you ever seen that TV show "Silicon Valley"? They have some pretty hilarious scenes about automated deployment.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I love that show. Those guys make me glad I'm in DevOps and not trying to start my own tech company.<p class=message>Haha yeah, same here. Well, it looks like we have some work to do. Let's get started on this automation project.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I'll pull up some documentation on our current deployment process and start mapping out how we can automate it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dbf5ab9e-107b-4a4f-9068-669ef6b3d0db.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
