How are you doing?<p class="message sent">I'm doing pretty well, thanks for having me. How about you?<p class=message>I'm good, thanks. So, tell me, what inspired you to pursue your line of work?<p class="message sent">Well, as a child, I was always fascinated by the world of fashion and design. I loved creating things and expressing myself through my clothes and accessories.<p class=message>That's really interesting. What do you love most about working in the fashion industry?<p class="message sent">I think the most rewarding part is being able to see your designs come to life and make people feel confident and beautiful. It's amazing to know that something you created can have such a positive impact on someone's day.<p class=message>Definitely. Do you have any fashion icons or inspirations?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. I've always been inspired by the style of Audrey Hepburn and Coco Chanel. They were such strong, independent women who had a real vision for fashion.<p class=message>I completely agree. So, I have to ask, what's your go-to outfit for a day off?<p class="message sent">Oh, that's easy! I love a good pair of jeans, a simple t-shirt, and some comfy sneakers. It's casual and relaxed, but still looks put together.<p class=message>Nice choice! And finally, what can we expect to see from you in the future?<p class="message sent">I have some exciting projects in the works, including a new line of accessories and some collaborations with other designers. I can't wait to see where my creativity takes me next!<p class=message>That sounds amazing. Thanks so much for chatting with me today!<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, it was a pleasure talking with you!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e5b5a0ee-fc13-4bea-8903-e12857aa316f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
