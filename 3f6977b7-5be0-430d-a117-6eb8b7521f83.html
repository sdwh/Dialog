I'm Chef A. Are you the photographer here to document our traditional Japanese dessert-making process?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct! I'm Photographer B, and I'm excited to be here to get some great shots of your beautiful and delicious wagashi.<p class=message>Well, you're in luck. We're making a batch of sakura mochi today. Have you tried it before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it like?<p class=message>It's a sweet and delicate mochi filled with sweetened red bean paste and wrapped in a cherry blossom leaf. Perfect for springtime!<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds amazing. Can I take some photos of the process?<p class=message>Of course! We love sharing our knowledge and skills with others. Plus, it's always great to have some pictures to share on social media.<p class="message sent">How do you get such a vibrant pink color on the mochi?<p class=message>We use sakura flower extract to add the color and flavor. It's important to use the right amount to get the perfect balance of taste and appearance.<p class="message sent">That's really cool. How long have you been making wagashi?<p class=message>I've been making it for over 15 years now. It's a family tradition that's been passed down for generations.<p class="message sent">That's amazing. How can I learn to make it like you?<p class=message>Well, you're in luck. We offer classes to teach people how to make our wagashi. You should definitely sign up for one!<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the suggestion!<p class=message>No problem. It's always great to share our culture and traditions with others.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And the best part is that we get to eat the delicious results!<p class=message>(laughing) Yes, that's definitely the best part. Shall we get started on making the sakura mochi?<p class="message sent">Let's do it! I can't wait to try it. And don't worry, I'll take some great photos to document the process.<p class=message>(smiling) Sounds like a plan. Let's make some wagashi together!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3f68e647-c55e-485d-9a16-16c281a17c8d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
