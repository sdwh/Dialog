Can you help me pick out some appropriate parts?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What is your budget for this project?<p class=message>Hmm, I would say around $1000.<p class="message sent">Great, we can definitely work with that. Do you have any specific preferences for the processor or graphics card?<p class=message>Honestly, I'm not too knowledgeable on that. I just want something that can handle multiple players and run smoothly.<p class="message sent">I understand. How about we start with a Ryzen 5 processor and a GTX 1660 graphics card? They are both great mid-range options.<p class=message>Sounds good to me. What about the memory?<p class="message sent">For a gaming server, I recommend at least 16 GB of memory. We have some affordable options if you're interested.<p class=message>Yes, that works for me. And what about storage?<p class="message sent">A solid-state drive would be the best option for quick loading and uptime. We have some great deals on a 500GB drive right now.<p class=message>Perfect, I'll go with that. And what do you recommend for the power supply?<p class="message sent">With the parts we've chosen, a 600-watt power supply should be sufficient. We have some good options in stock.<p class=message>Ok, let's add that to the list too. Thank you so much for your help!<p class="message sent">Of course! Do you need any help with the assembly or installation?<p class=message>That would be great. I'm not very experienced in building computers.<p class="message sent">No problem, our technicians can handle that for you. And just so you know, we offer a warranty on all of our parts and services.<p class=message>That's good to know. Thank you again for your assistance.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, happy gaming! If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=20b99dd3-f10d-4936-a8cc-7ccbbd09d2d5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
