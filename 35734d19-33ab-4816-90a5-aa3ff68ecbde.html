And for our classic milk tea, we use high-quality tea leaves and fresh milk.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. How long have you been working here?<p class=message>I've been making noodles for over 10 years.

I love experimenting with new flavors and ingredients.<p class=message>That's really interesting. Do you have any favorite milk tea flavor combinations?<p class="message sent">Definitely! I like to mix jasmine green tea with honey and a splash of coconut milk. It's a tropical twist on a classic drink.<p class=message>That sounds heavenly. Have you tried adding any special toppings to your milk tea?<p class="message sent">Yes, I love to add fruit jelly or grass jelly for a unique texture. And of course, boba is always a crowd-pleaser.<p class=message>I agree! Our boba is homemade and cooked to perfection. It's always chewy and sweet.<p class="message sent">Your attention to detail really shows. Speaking of details, what kind of noodles do you use for your beef noodle soup?<p class=message>We use hand-pulled noodles that are made fresh every day.
