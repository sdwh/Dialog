I’m sorry to hear that. What can I assist you with?<p class=message>I have to change my plans and I cannot make it to my original flight.<p class="message sent">That’s not a problem. Do you have a specific date and time already in mind?<p class=message>Yes, I’d like to reschedule for next week if possible.<p class="message sent">Let me check if there are available flights. (checks the computer) Yes, we do have flights available.<p class=message>That’s great news! How do I proceed with the rebooking?<p class="message sent">First, we need to process your refund. We'll deduct the applicable charges and then we'll offer you the option for the new booking.<p class=message>Okay, that sounds reasonable. By the way, I love the new aircraft design you guys have.<p class="message sent">Thank you for the compliment! We are glad you like it. Did you know that the swanky new interior helps reduce fuel consumption and emissions?<p class=message>Wow, that not only pleases the eye but also promotes sustainability. You guys rock!<p class="message sent">We try our best to make sure our customers are happy and the environment is taken care of.<p class=message>That’s amazing. You guys are very thoughtful. Anyway, what would be the expected processing time for my refund?<p class="message sent">It typically takes three to five business days for the refund to reflect on your account.<p class=message>Alright, that’s good to know. Thanks for helping me with everything.<p class="message sent">You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?<p class=message>No, that’s everything. Thanks again! Have a great day.<p class="message sent">You too, take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1527179d-e844-430b-bb52-7cde377d006b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
