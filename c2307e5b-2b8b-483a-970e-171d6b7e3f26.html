How's your day going so far?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty well, A. Just finished baking our fresh batch of croissants.<p class=message>That sounds really tasty. Want to grab a coffee with me before we open up shop?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. I always love pairing my morning coffee with a nice croissant.<p class=message>Same here. So, did you hear about that new bakery that just opened up down the street?<p class="message sent">I did. But, I'm not too worried. Our croissants and baguettes are the best in the city.<p class=message>That's definitely true. Plus, we are a great team. You make the bread and I make the coffee.<p class="message sent">You got that right. Speaking of which, any new coffee blends for this week?<p class=message>I actually just got in some Colombian beans that are supposed to be really good. Want to try them out?<p class="message sent">Definitely. Maybe we can even offer some samples to our customers.<p class=message>Great idea! And, we could pair them with our fresh pain au chocolat.<p class="message sent">Oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.<p class=message>Mine too. I think we're going to have a busy day ahead of us.<p class="message sent">No doubt about it. But, with our delicious pastries and coffee, we'll both be smiling all the way to the bank.<p class=message>Haha, you got that right. Let's get ready to open up shop and give our customers the best French experience they can get.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, A. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c22eba41-1f1b-4446-a743-d10cb33a7427.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
