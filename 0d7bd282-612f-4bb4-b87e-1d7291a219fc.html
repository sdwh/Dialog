Can that help with my condition?<p class=message>Yes, exercise can definitely help with managing diabetes. Combining medication with a healthy diet and regular exercise can help you stay healthy.<p class="message sent">Okay, thank you for your help. Can I also ask about any potential side effects from my medication?<p class=message>Of course, it's important to be aware of any side effects. Make sure to read the information leaflet that comes with your medication and if you have any concerns, don't hesitate to ask your doctor or pharmacist.<p class="message sent">Thank you for all your help and advice.
