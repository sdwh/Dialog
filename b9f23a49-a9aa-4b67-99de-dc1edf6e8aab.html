Let's start today's class by discussing your homework from last week.<p class="message sent">Oh no, I totally forgot about it!<p class=message>It's okay, B. I'll give you a pass this time. But please make sure to complete your assignments on time.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I'll make sure to catch up.<p class=message>So, let's move on to today's lesson which is about idiomatic expressions. Do you know any?<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I've heard of "raining cats and dogs".<p class=message>Yes, that's a good one! Can you use it in a sentence?<p class="message sent">Sure. It was raining cats and dogs yesterday, so I stayed indoors all day.<p class=message>Great job! Here's another one for you - "piece of cake".<p class="message sent">Oh, I know that one! It means something is very easy. Like, this exam is a piece of cake.<p class=message>Excellent! You're getting the hang of it now. How about we have a mini competition? We'll see who can come up with the most idiomatic expressions.<p class="message sent">Okay, challenge accepted!<p class=message>Alright, timeâ€™s up. Let's hear what you came up with, B.<p class="message sent">Alright. "Hit the sack", "break a leg", "kick the bucket", "hold your horses", "let the cat out of the bag", "barking up the wrong tree", "the ball is in your court", "put a sock in it", "bite the bullet", "give it a shot".<p class=message>Wow, you really know your stuff! You're going to ace the idiom section in your exams.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! That was so much fun. I can't wait for the next class.<p class=message>Me too. Alright, everyone. That's all for today. See you all next week!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b9f22146-763a-4454-9a6f-9147e233cab1.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
