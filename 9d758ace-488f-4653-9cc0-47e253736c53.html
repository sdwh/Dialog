Got a lot of orders to deliver though.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Do you need any help with the deliveries?<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I appreciate it, but I think I got this. I don't want to keep you away from managing the restaurant.<p class=message>No worries, B. It's part of my job to help out my team. Speaking of which, have you tried our new dish, the spicy chicken wings?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have! They are amazing, I love the kick of spice in them.<p class=message>Glad to hear that! We've been getting a lot of orders for those wings lately. The customers really seem to enjoy them.<p class="message sent">I can definitely see why. Oh, speaking of customers, we have an order for 5 burgers and fries to be delivered to the airport.<p class=message>Alright, got it. Make sure to double-check that everything is in the bag before leaving.<p class="message sent">Of course, A. Can't afford to forget anything!<p class=message>Haha, yeah we definitely don't want any angry and hungry customers. Oh, by the way, did I tell you about the time I accidentally delivered an order to the wrong address?<p class="message sent">No, what happened?<p class=message>Well, long story short, I ended up delivering the customer's food to their neighbor's house. The neighbor ended up keeping the food and I had to go back to the restaurant to prepare a new order for the customer.<p class="message sent">Oh no, that definitely sounds like a nightmare. Has that ever happened to you, B?<p class="message sent">Not yet, thankfully haha. But thanks for the reminder to double-check the address.<p class=message>No problem, B. And don't forget to wear your mask and sanitize before entering the airport!<p class="message sent">Will do, A. Thanks for looking out for me.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Stay safe out there and happy delivering!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9d72b28f-cb08-4ffe-9913-3f683212ec22.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
