What is it?<p class=message>It's a standard for managing mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets in a secure and efficient way.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. How does it work?<p class=message>Basically, it sets out guidelines for things like password policies, encryption, and remote wiping of devices.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So it's about making sure that company data stays safe on employees' phones and tablets?<p class=message>Exactly. It's becoming more and more important as mobile devices play a bigger role in the workplace.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. So what kinds of things does the standard cover?<p class=message>It covers everything from setting up secure connections to corporate systems, to monitoring employee usage of mobile devices.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a lot of work. Are there any benefits to following the standard?<p class=message>Definitely. By following the ISO 27001 MDM standard, companies can reduce the risk of data breaches, improve their overall information security, and even save money on support costs.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's pretty impressive. Have you worked with companies that have implemented the standard?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It's amazing how much more in control companies feel over their mobile devices once they follow the standard.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. It's great to see that there's a standard out there to help companies keep their mobile devices secure.<p class=message>Absolutely. And with more and more companies going mobile, it's going to be even more important in the years ahead.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c69e3309-9a88-43f5-8f7d-b3ceb4348e08.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
