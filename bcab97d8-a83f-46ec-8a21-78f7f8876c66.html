I'm a new mom and I'm not sure which medication to give my baby for his fever.<p class=message>I understand. It's important to choose the right medication for your little one. Is he over six months old?<p class="message sent">Yes, he is.<p class=message>In that case, you can try giving him acetaminophen. It's safe for infants and can help reduce fever and pain.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. How much should I give him?<p class=message>The recommended dosage is usually based on your baby's weight. Do you know how much your baby weighs?<p class="message sent">Yes, he weighs around 15 pounds.<p class=message>Okay, for a baby his weight, the dosage would be about 1.25 mL of liquid acetaminophen. You can use a dropper to administer the medicine.<p class="message sent">Thanks, that's very helpful. Are there other options I should consider?<p class=message>If your baby's fever persists, you can also try using ibuprofen. However, ibuprofen is not recommended for infants younger than six months.<p class="message sent">I see. Thanks for the advice. Do you have any other tips for taking care of a sick baby?<p class=message>Of course. Make sure your baby stays hydrated by offering plenty of fluids. Keep him comfortable with light clothing and a room temperature of around 68 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. And don't hesitate to seek medical attention if his condition worsens.<p class="message sent">Thanks for all of your help! I feel much more prepared now.<p class=message>My pleasure. That's what I'm here for. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions in the future.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=bca7d8c2-51c2-42ec-a647-81816017c045.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
