How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. It was wonderful, thank you. I went on a hike with some friends. How about you?<p class=message>That sounds lovely. I spent most of the time catching up on some movies and spending time with my family.<p class="message sent">That sounds relaxing. So, let's get started with the progress report. We're making good headway on the new project.<p class=message>That's great news. How's the team doing? Any issues?<p class="message sent">No issues so far, everyone's been very cooperative. Speaking of cooperating, did you hear that the new coffee machine has arrived in the break room?<p class=message>Yes, I did. I tried it this morning and it's fantastic. I was able to start my day on a positive note.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. It's the little things that can make a big difference, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. So going back to the progress report, have we set a deadline for the project's completion?<p class="message sent">We haven't set a specific deadline yet, but we're aiming for a tentative timeline of six months.<p class=message>Alright, that sounds reasonable. Let's make sure we stay on track and meet our deadlines.<p class="message sent">Definitely. By the way, did you see the new mural in the lobby? It's really impressive.<p class=message>Actually, I haven't had the chance to see it yet. I've been meaning to take a break and swing by.<p class="message sent">I highly recommend it. It's a great conversation starter with clients and visitors.<p class=message>Alright, that's something to look forward to. Let's wrap up the meeting and get back to work.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Thanks for the update, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b23a7940-f7be-456e-9cf1-91b68bbd9aa2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
