It's a way to prevent cyber attacks by manipulating people into revealing sensitive information.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. How does it work?<p class=message>One effective way is to fake an email and make it look like it's from a trustworthy source. Then ask the receiver to disclose their login credentials.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds pretty scary.<p class=message>I know! Companies should definitely be aware of this and make sure they have strict policies and guidelines in place.<p class="message sent">But what if someone falls for it despite the guidelines?<p class=message>That's why conducting regular training and testing on employees is crucial. It ensures that they are aware of the risks and are better equipped to handle them.<p class="message sent">It makes sense. What are some other types of social engineering attacks?<p class=message>Oh, there are so many! There's baiting, phishing, tailgating, and pretexting just to name a few.<p class="message sent">Wow, I had no idea there were so many ways for hackers to try to gain access to information.<p class=message>Yeah, it's definitely a constant battle to stay ahead of the game.<p class="message sent">Well, it's a good thing we have experts like you on the front line.<p class=message>Haha, I don't know about being an expert but I do try my best.<p class="message sent">Hey, knowledge is the first step towards prevention. So thanks for educating me on this topic.<p class=message>My pleasure! Always happy to raise awareness and fight against cybercrime.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=98e7f2cc-e6e6-4cea-b635-76b2624f4ab2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
