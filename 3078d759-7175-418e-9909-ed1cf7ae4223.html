Ready for a trip to Australia Gold Darwin?<p class=message>I am! I've never been there before, do you have any recommendations for things to do?<p class="message sent">Definitely check out the Mindil Beach Sunset Market. The food is great and the sunset is even better.<p class=message>That sounds awesome. I'm excited to try some new foods. Have you tried anything unusual there?<p class="message sent">Oh yeah, once I tried crocodile meat. It was interesting, but I think I'll stick to the more traditional options this time.<p class=message>(laughs) I don't know if I'm brave enough to try that.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, you don't have to. How about some kangaroo meat instead?<p class=message>Hmm, I'll think about it. Do you have any favorite spots to go for a walk or hike?<p class="message sent">Definitely the George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens. It's a nice place to relax and take in some nature.<p class=message>Great suggestion. I have to admit, I'm a bit nervous about the wildlife. Are there snakes or spiders we need to watch out for?<p class="message sent">There are some venomous ones around, but they're pretty rare. Just keep an eye out and you'll be fine.<p class=message>Okay, I'll try not to freak out if I see one. (laughs) How much longer until we arrive?<p class="message sent">We're almost there, about 10 more minutes or so. Do you have any other questions about Darwin?<p class=message>Not at the moment, but I'll definitely keep your recommendations in mind. Thanks for the help!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Enjoy your trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=30789b01-c28f-4191-b1ea-d0243278e9ac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
