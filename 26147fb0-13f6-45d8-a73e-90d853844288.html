Are you excited to try the local delicacies of the Wanhua district today?<p class="message sent">Of course, Chef A! I've heard so much about the pork leg with vermicelli and pineapple cakes. We have to make sure they're top-notch for our customers.<p class=message>I agree. Let's start with the pork leg. We need to simmer it for at least five hours to make it melt-in-your-mouth tender.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a long time. While we wait, let's taste some of these pineapple cakes. Mmm, sweet and crispy on the outside, with a chewy filling.<p class=message>That's right. They should complement the savory pork leg perfectly. Speaking of which, it's ready! Let's assemble the dish and give it a try.<p class="message sent">Incredible, the pork is so flavorful and the vermicelli has soaked up all the juices. This is going to be a hit on our menu.<p class=message>Wait, there's something missing. We need some heat to balance out the sweetness. Let's add some chili oil to the dish.<p class="message sent">Brilliant idea, Chef A. It gives it a nice kick but still maintains the original taste. Okay, now onto the pineapple cakes. Can we make them in-house?<p class=message>Definitely, but we'll need some fresh pineapple. Luckily, there's a market nearby that sells them. I'll go pick some up while you start prepping the dough.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan, Chef A. While you're out, I'll take care of tasting some more local snacks for research purposes.<p class=message>Ha, I like the way you think. Just make sure to save room for our own creations later.<p class="message sent">No problem. I'm already stuffed from this pork leg and vermicelli, though. We have to make sure our portions are just the right size.<p class=message>Agreed, we don't want our customers leaving feeling too full or too hungry. Let's keep perfecting these dishes until they're just right.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=260eace3-5483-4ec6-a9f5-da7ed0ee0ea7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
