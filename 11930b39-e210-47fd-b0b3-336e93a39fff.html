How's business treating you today?<p class="message sent">Pretty good actually, thanks A. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain, always busy selling hot dogs to people on the go.<p class="message sent">I see that. Speaking of hot dogs, would you want to try some of my latest flavor additions for your hot dogs?<p class=message>Sure, we could pair them with your delicious icy treats. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">For starters, how about a hotdog with a topping of mixed berries and light cream cheese? And on the side, I have just the perfect lemon sorbet.<p class=message>Sounds like a good combo. I think our customers would love that. Even better, how about we offer them as a meal deal?<p class="message sent">Now you're talking! We should also advertise it more prominently on our storefront.<p class=message>Yes, we could even give away some free samples to people passing by to promote it.<p class="message sent">I love your marketing spirit, A. By the way, did you see that new food truck down the street?<p class=message>Yeah, I did. What do they sell?<p class="message sent">They sell sushi burritos!<p class=message>Wow, I never thought of that combo before. I guess we have some competition.<p class="message sent">It's a good thing we have similar but unique offerings. Variety is the spice of life, they say.<p class=message>That's true. I'm just glad we have a good partnership and we can support each other's businesses.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. Here's to another great day of sales.<p class=message>Cheers to that, B!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=11922e28-5d70-456f-8918-aa6faa368e91.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
