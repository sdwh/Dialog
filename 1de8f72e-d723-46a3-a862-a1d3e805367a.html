What's it about?<p class=message>Basically, it's a training program designed to educate employees on security risks and how to mitigate them at work.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds useful. Is it mandatory for all employees or just a select few?<p class=message>Well, it depends on the organization's policies. Some require all employees to go through it, while others only require certain departments or job roles to.<p class="message sent">Got it. So, what kind of topics does the training cover?<p class=message>It covers a wide range of topics, like password security, data protection, and even social engineering tactics to be aware of.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a lot to cover. How long does the training usually take?<p class=message>It really depends on the organization, but it usually ranges from a couple of hours to a full day of training.<p class="message sent">Do participants have to take an exam or assessment at the end of the training?<p class=message>Yes, most programs require some kind of assessment to ensure that employees have understood the material.<p class="message sent">Are the assessments difficult?<p class=message>It really depends on how much effort each employee has put in during the training. But it's not something to stress over too much.<p class="message sent">That's reassuring! Is the training only available in English or are there other languages offered as well?<p class=message>It really depends on the training provider. Some offer courses in multiple languages, while others only offer it in English.<p class="message sent">I see. How much does it usually cost to participate in the training program?<p class=message>The cost varies depending on the training provider and the organization's needs, but it can range from a couple of hundred dollars to thousands of dollars.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's quite a range. Is it worth the investment though?<p class=message>Absolutely. By providing employees with awareness training, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood of costly security breaches.<p class="message sent">Makes sense. Thanks for sharing about ISO 27001 with me, A. I'll definitely look into it more.<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to share insights on security and risk management.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1de385a8-2904-41f3-afdc-4d1d5d840734.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
