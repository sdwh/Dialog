How long have you been a taxi driver for?<p class="message sent">G'day mate, I've been on the roads for about 10 years now. Can you believe it?<p class=message>Wow, that's a long time! Do you have any funny stories to share?<p class="message sent">Actually, I remember this one time when a kangaroo jumped in front of my car. I had to slam the brakes and it hopped away like nothing happened!<p class=message>Haha, that's so Australian! Have you ever been to Darwin before?<p class="message sent">Quite a few times. It's a great city, perfect for catching some sun at Mindil Beach while watching the sunset with a cold beer.<p class=message>Sounds lovely! I'm planning to visit the Australia Gold Darwin. What's your favorite tourist spot there?<p class="message sent">I reckon the Crocosaurus Cove is worth visiting. You can get up close and personal with some mighty crocs! Bit scary but an unforgettable experience.<p class=message>Yikes, that does sound scary but also exciting! Have you ever tried eating kangaroo meat?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. It's a bit gamey but tasty if you cook it right. Do you wanna give it a go?<p class=message>Maybe next time! I'm still getting used to some of the Aussie cuisine. Have you tried vegemite?<p class="message sent">Vegemite's a staple on our toast! It's an acquired taste but once you love it, you can't live without it!<p class=message>Ha, I'll have to trust your opinion on that. Thanks for the ride and for sharing some insights on Darwin with me!<p class="message sent">No worries mate, happy to help! Enjoy your stay in Darwin and don't forget to wear sunscreen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f1e6abdc-0e57-47c4-97cc-35c8103e0f13.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
