It's all about managing information security risks, isn't it?<p class=message>That's right! And you know what? It's not just for big companies. Even small businesses can benefit from it.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's good to know. But what exactly does managing assets mean?<p class=message>It means identifying and managing all the assets that your company uses to store or process information. That includes everything from hardware to software.<p class="message sent">Ah, I get it now. It's like managing a treasure trove of information. But what if we don't have a lot of assets?<p class=message>No worries, B. Even one laptop or a mobile phone counts as an asset. It's all about identifying and securing what you have.<p class="message sent">Great! So how do we get started? Do we need a special tool?<p class=message>Not really. You just need to identify your assets and put them on a spreadsheet. Trust me, it's like a fun game of inventory management.<p class="message sent">Haha, sounds exciting! And what's the benefit of implementing ISO 27001 Asset Management?<p class=message>Well, it helps you protect your company's information from getting stolen, lost or corrupted. It gives you peace of mind knowing that your assets are properly secured.<p class="message sent">That's definitely worth it. Hey, A, do you know any good jokes about Asset Management?<p class=message>Hmm, let me thinkâ€¦ Ah, I got one. Why did the asset manager quit his job? Because he was tired of counting sheep!<p class="message sent">Hahaha! That's hilarious, A. Thanks for lightening up the Asset Management talk.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ad1112bd-09bc-4339-8323-f1e2153bfbe9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
