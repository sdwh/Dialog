How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not bad, A. Just preparing the soy milk for our customers. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. I'm just getting the dough ready for the shaobing. It's always busy in the morning.<p class="message sent">Yeah, people love their Chinese breakfast. It's always a good start to the day.<p class=message>Definitely. Speaking of which, how about we make a special veggie shaobing with some soy milk on the side? It'll go great together.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a great idea. Let's get to work.<p class=message>Sure thing. I'll roll out the dough and brush on some sesame oil while you heat up the fryer.<p class="message sent">Got it. And I'll pour in the soy milk into the blender with some sugar and vanilla.<p class=message>Perfect. And once the shaobing are cooked up, we'll serve it to our eager customers with a smile.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more, A. It's always great to see their happy and satisfied faces.<p class=message>That's what makes it all worth it. And hey, maybe today we'll have some new customers who've never tried Chinese breakfast before.<p class="message sent">I'm excited to hear what they think. Oh, and don't forget to pour in the hot sauce for those who like an extra kick.<p class=message>Good call, B. Okay, let's get to work and make some delicious and authentic Chinese breakfast for our customers!<p class="message sent">Sounds great, A. Let's do this!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=211ee2c0-fb7f-46e4-b933-d92ee811f0fa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
