I heard that you guys found some vulnerabilities during your penetration testing. How's it going with the fixes?<p class="message sent">Yup, we did find some. It's been quite a ride, but we're almost done. Just waiting for the green light from the management.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Makes my job easier. Say, what kind of vulnerabilities did you uncover?<p class="message sent">Oh, just the usual stuff - SQL injection, cross-site scripting, weak passwords, and the like.<p class=message>Haha, the usual stuff, huh? Those are still pretty serious issues, but I'm sure you've got them covered.<p class="message sent">Yeah, but it's always something different every time. Keeps us on our toes.<p class=message>That's the spirit! Can you walk me through the process of how you fix these vulnerabilities?<p class="message sent">Sure, we first identify and prioritize the vulnerabilities, then create a fix plan. After that, we apply security patches and run some more tests to ensure everything's back to normal.<p class=message>Sounds like a lot of work, but definitely worth it in the end.<p class="message sent">Definitely. We need to stay one step ahead of those pesky hackers.<p class=message>Speaking of hackers, have you ever done any ethical hacking yourself?<p class="message sent">Nope, that's your department. I prefer working with databases.<p class=message>Fair enough. But you should try it sometime. It's quite an adrenaline rush.<p class="message sent">Maybe one day. For now, I'll stick to my comfort zone.<p class=message>That's cool. Well, thanks for sharing your insights. It's always good learning from other IT professionals.<p class="message sent">No problem. And thanks for helping keep our system secure. We appreciate what you do.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1de078ba-9e93-428f-a5c4-2fa97078fa4c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
