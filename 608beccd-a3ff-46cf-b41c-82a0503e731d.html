Great job tonight on the menu. Our customers were raving about the coq au vin.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It's one of my favorites to make. I'm glad they enjoyed it.<p class=message>Speaking of favorites, have you tried the new chocolate souffle we added to the dessert menu?<p class="message sent">I actually just tried it earlier. It's definitely a crowd-pleaser. The chocolate is so rich and decadent.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. I was worried it might be too heavy for a dessert, but it seems to be just the right amount.<p class="message sent">You know what they say, A, there's always room for chocolate.<p class=message>Agreed! By the way, I noticed we are running low on truffle oil. Can you make sure we have enough for tomorrow's menu?<p class="message sent">I'll add it to my to-do list. Speaking of tomorrow's menu, what's the game plan?<p class=message>We have a few large parties coming in, so we'll need to make sure we have everything prepped and ready to go. And don't forget, we have a new pastry chef starting tomorrow.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's exciting news. Do we know what specialties they'll be bringing to the table?<p class=message>From what I've heard, they're a master at macarons and croissants. So, we'll have an even stronger dessert game.<p class="message sent">Sounds like we'll be keeping busy. But I have faith that we can handle it all.<p class=message>Absolutely. And who knows, maybe we'll even impress some food critics along the way.<p class="message sent">Hey, anything is possible. With our culinary skills, we could be the talk of Houston!<p class=message>I love your confidence, B. Let's keep pushing ourselves to be the best we can be.<p class="message sent">Agreed, A. I'm looking forward to the challenge and the delicious food we'll be creating.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6086a0ae-158c-4d70-88a7-34713c22e9fd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
