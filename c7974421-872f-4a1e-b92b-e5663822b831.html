But I figure if we're doing our job, they're probably just glad to see us.<p class=message>I hope so. Speaking of which, have you noticed that man over there acting suspiciously?<p class="message sent">Yeah, he's been pacing back and forth for a while. Let's go check it out.<p class=message>Good idea. Excuse me, sir, is there something we can help you with?<p class="message sent">Is there a reason you're pacing back and forth?<p class=message>Well, that's understandable. Just make sure you're not causing any trouble, okay?<p class="message sent">Whew, crisis averted. I always get nervous when we have to talk to people like that.<p class=message>Yeah, but it's all part of the job. At least we get to see some interesting things out here.<p class="message sent">Like that guy with the giant parrot on his shoulder?<p class=message>Or the group of kids breakdancing in the park? I never know what to expect on this beat.<p class="message sent">That's what makes it exciting. But let's not get too distracted. We still have a job to do.<p class=message>You're right. Time to get back to patrolling.<p class="message sent">Hey, at least we're getting some exercise in, right?<p class=message>Right. And maybe we'll even get a good story out of this shift to tell our families at dinner tonight.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Let's just hope nothing too crazy happens.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c794a020-0b9b-4070-aa5c-b06cba2707c7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
