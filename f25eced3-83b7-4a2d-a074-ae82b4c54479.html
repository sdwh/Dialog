I'm one of the food processing workers here. It's nice to meet you.<p class="message sent">Hello! I'm the owner of this candy store. I'm excited to work with you today.<p class=message>Same here. I'm familiar with the traditional candy-making techniques used in Chaozhou. What type of candy are we making today?<p class="message sent">We'll be making Coconut Rolls. It's a popular candy among the locals and tourists alike.<p class=message>Sounds delicious. What are the ingredients we'll be using?<p class="message sent">We'll be using grated coconut, sugar, and a little bit of milk. We'll also add some food coloring for extra appeal.<p class=message>Interesting. Can you show me how to make it?<p class="message sent">Sure. First, we mix the grated coconut with sugar and milk until it becomes a paste. Then, we roll it out and add the food coloring. Finally, we cut it into small pieces and wrap it with rice paper.<p class=message>That seems easy enough. I'm excited to try it out.<p class="message sent">Great! Let's get started then. Oh, and by the way, have you tried our other Chaozhou candies?<p class=message>Not yet, but I heard they're really good.<p class="message sent">They are! We have everything from peanut candy to fruit jelly. You should try them out.<p class=message>I definitely will. Which one is your personal favorite?<p class="message sent">That's a tough question. I love them all, but if I had to choose, I'd say the Osmanthus Flower Cake.<p class=message>That sounds intriguing. What's it made of?<p class="message sent">It's made of sticky rice flour, sugar, and Osmanthus flowers. It has a unique floral taste and aroma.<p class=message>Wow, I'll definitely give that a try too. Thanks for introducing me to all these delicious candies.<p class="message sent">No problem. It's my pleasure. Working together to make traditional Chaozhou candies is what makes this area special, after all.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Let's keep it up!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f25aab6a-18fc-4195-882a-0ad653cf917a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
