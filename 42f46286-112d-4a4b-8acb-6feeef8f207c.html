Just a little nervous about the audit.<p class=message>No need to worry, everything looks good so far.<p class="message sent">That's a relief, I was worried about all those receipts I lost.<p class=message>No problem, we were able to retrieve them from the credit card company.<p class="message sent">That's amazing, I owe you guys one.<p class=message>It's all part of the job, but we'll definitely take that thank you in the form of a good review.<p class="message sent">You'll get a great review for sure. But can we talk about that company lunch I expensed?<p class=message>(laughing) Yes, let's chat about it. But I think we're going to have to call it a business expense.<p class="message sent">Fair enough, as long as my boss doesn't find out.<p class=message>Your secret is safe with me. So, what else can we go over to make sure everything's in order?<p class="message sent">I think we covered everything. Your team really has been a huge help during this whole process.<p class=message>Thank you, that means a lot to us. We try our best to make these audits as painless as possible.<p class="message sent">Well, you've definitely succeeded. I feel much better about everything now.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Let's wrap things up, and we'll be in touch with any next steps.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, thanks again for everything.<p class=message>Anytime, have a good day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=42ef5360-7a90-4955-bf4e-0d24e0cfdc28.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
