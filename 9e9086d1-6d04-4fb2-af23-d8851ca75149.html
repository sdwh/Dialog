Could you show me where the bug is occurring?<p class=message>Yeah, sure. It's right here on this page.<p class="message sent">Hmmm, it looks like a coding issue. Have you tried turning it off and on again?<p class=message>Ha, no I haven't. But let me give that a try right now.<p class="message sent">Alright, let's see if that does the trick.<p class=message>Looks like it worked! Thank you so much B.<p class="message sent">No problem A, sometimes it really is that simple. Have you heard about the new coffee machine in the break room though?<p class=message>No, I haven't. What's so special about it?<p class="message sent">It's got all these fancy flavor options and can even make latte art. It's the talk of the office.<p class=message>Wow, I'm definitely going to have to try it out then. Thanks for letting me know.<p class="message sent">Of course, it's the little things that make office life better, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. Speaking of which, did you catch the latest episode of that new comedy on Netflix?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't had a chance yet. Was it good?<p class=message>Yes, it was hilarious! You've got to check it out.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Thanks for the recommendation, A. Now let's go grab some coffee and get back to work.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e8f1b69-9e5c-4fd3-a936-696fb7c08296.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
