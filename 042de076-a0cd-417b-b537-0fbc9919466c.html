It's an international standard for information security management, right?<p class="message received message-content">That's right! And do you know about the Information Security Objectives?<p class="message sent message-content">Sort of. I know they're goals you set to protect your information assets.<p class="message received message-content">You got it! And the cool thing is that you can adapt those objectives to suit your company's unique needs and risks.<p class="message sent message-content">Hmm, sounds like a lot of work. But I guess it's worth it to keep our information safe.<p class="message received message-content">Absolutely! Plus, having ISO 27001 certification can boost our company's reputation and appeal to clients.<p class="message sent message-content">That's a good point. So what are some examples of Information Security Objectives?<p class="message received message-content">Well, there's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For example, we might set an objective to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, ensure accurate and complete information, and make sure our systems and data are always accessible.<p class="message sent message-content">Got it. Those all sound pretty important!<p class="message received message-content">Definitely. And the best part is, by setting clear objectives, we can measure our progress and continuously improve our security measures.<p class="message sent message-content">I like the sound of that. Let's get started on our own objectives!<p class="message received message-content">Sounds like a plan. With ISO 27001 on our side, we can tackle any security challenge!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=042d2e75-4837-4920-a4dc-c8912c7184e2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
