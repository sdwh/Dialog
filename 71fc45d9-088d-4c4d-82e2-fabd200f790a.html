How's your day going?<p class="message sent">It's going well, thanks for asking! How about yours?<p class=message>Pretty good, thanks. So, have you been driving taxis for a long time?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's been a while. I think I've been doing it for around 10 years now.<p class=message>Wow, that's quite a long time! So, do you have any favorite places to take passengers?<p class="message sent">Honestly, I just enjoy driving around the city and seeing different parts of it. But I do have a soft spot for the historic areas, like Bukchon Hanok Village.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. Have you visited it before?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. It's a great spot to take friends and family when they come to visit.<p class=message>Speaking of visitors, have you ever had any famous passengers before?<p class="message sent">Ha! Not really. I mean, I once drove a K-Pop idol to the airport, but other than that, just regular folks like you and me.<p class=message>Well, that's still pretty cool! I hope I'm not too boring of a passenger for you.<p class="message sent">Oh, not at all! It's always great to meet new people and learn about their stories.<p class=message>Well, I'm happy to share. How about we talk about something fun? Do you have any favorite hobbies?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. I really enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes.<p class=message>Oh, cool! Anything particularly delicious that you've made recently?<p class="message sent">I made a killer kimchi fried rice last night. Want the recipe?<p class=message>Yes, please! That sounds amazing.<p class="message sent">Alright, so first you... *continues to explain recipe*<p class=message>Wow, that sounds delicious. Can't wait to try it out myself!<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's a great way to enjoy some traditional Korean flavors in a new way.<p class=message>Well, thanks for the recommendation! We're almost at my destination, so I'll let you focus on driving now.<p class="message sent">Alrighty, have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=71fb1ba5-6430-4ebb-aae2-497c10ecb302.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
