Can you recommend a special cocktail?<p class=message>Of course! We have a special cocktail that's popular here in Foshan. It's called the "Jade Dragon".<p class="message sent">Sounds intriguing. What's in it?<p class=message>It's made with a blend of vodka, lychee liqueur, lime, and cucumber syrup. It's then topped with a splash of soda water and garnished with a cucumber slice.<p class="message sent">That does sound good. I'll have one of those.<p class=message>Great! It'll take just a few minutes to mix up. Do you mind if I ask why you're out tonight?<p class="message sent">Just celebrating a big promotion at work. I need something to help me unwind.<p class=message>Wow, congratulations! This drink will definitely do the trick.<p class="message sent">Thanks. So, how long have you been a bartender?<p class=message>About 5 years now. I've worked in a few different places, but I love it here.<p class="message sent">What's your favorite drink to mix up?<p class=message>Hmm, that's a tough one. I'd have to say the Old Fashioned. It's a classic.<p class="message sent">I can appreciate that. You really know your craft.<p class=message>It's all about the balance of flavors. Every drink needs the perfect mix of sweet, sour, and bitter.<p class="message sent">You make it sound so easy. Maybe I should give it a try.<p class=message>I could teach you a thing or two! Who knows, maybe you'll discover a talent you never knew you had.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a challenge! Okay, but let me finish my Jade Dragon first. It's too delicious to put down.<p class=message>Absolutely. I'll be here whenever you're ready. Cheers!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c33c73d3-754a-4117-9939-82fc5e7c6326.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
