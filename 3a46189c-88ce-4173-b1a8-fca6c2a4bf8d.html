I'm a fisherman here to check out the local seafood at the Tsukiji fish market, mind showing me around?<p class="message sent">Welcome and sure thing! As a guide, it's my job to help people pick out the freshest and best quality seafood in the market.<p class=message>Perfect, I'm most interested in the fish. What should I look out for when selecting them?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, you want to make sure the eyes of the fish are clear, not cloudy. This indicates freshness. Also, pay attention to the gills, they should be bright red.<p class=message>Got it, so if the fish looks dull and the gills are brownish, it's not the best choice?<p class="message sent">Correct. You also want to check the texture of the fish's skin. It should be smooth and not slimy.<p class=message>That all sounds helpful! What about shellfish?<p class="message sent">With shellfish, freshness is key. Look for closed and tightly shut shells, and avoid those with broken shells or bad odors.<p class=message>I see. What can you tell me about sushi-grade tuna?<p class="message sent">Sushi-grade tuna is of premium quality, and often used in high-end restaurants. It should have a bright red flesh and firm texture.<p class=message>Thanks! This has been so educational. Do you have any personal favorites in the market to recommend?<p class="message sent">Personally, I love uni or sea urchin. It has a sweet, buttery taste. Plus, they're usually sold with their shells and spines for decoration!<p class=message>Wow, I've never tried uni before. I'll definitely have to give that a try. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help! Don't forget to haggle for the best deals and enjoy your fresh seafood!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3a451d00-830d-4a88-9969-5a7688d193bf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
