How's business?<p class="message sent">It's going well, A. How have you been?<p class=message>Can't complain. The fishing's been good lately. Speaking of which, do you need any fresh catches for your restaurant?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm always on the lookout for the freshest seafood for our customers. What have you got for me today?<p class=message>Well, we've got some delicious tuna and salmon, and we also have some prawns and mussels.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! I'll take them all. So, any suggestions on new menu items?<p class=message>How about some grilled prawns with garlic butter, or a salmon ceviche? They're both perfect for the summer season.<p class="message sent">Excellent idea! We'll add those to the menu. By the way, have you tried our lobster rolls? They've been a hit with our customers.<p class=message>I haven't had a chance to try them yet. Maybe I'll stop by for lunch one day this week.<p class="message sent">You should! And while you're here, we can also discuss future seafood orders.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! Oh, and I almost forgot to mention - we'll have some fresh crab coming in next week. Would you like some?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'll make sure to include them in our specials. Thanks, A!<p class=message>No problem, B. Always happy to help out a fellow sea lover.<p class="message sent">And we appreciate it. You're a valuable partner in our business.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0c00e9ff-8902-4105-b2f1-c52a3632c943.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
