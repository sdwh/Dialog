It's one of my favorite dishes.<p class=message>Really? I've never had it before. What makes it so good?<p class="message sent">It's a mixture of different spices that create this unique flavor. It's like a party in your mouth!<p class=message>That sounds amazing. I'll have to give it a try.<p class="message sent">You definitely should! But be prepared, it can be quite spicy.<p class=message>I can handle spicy food. What type of meat is usually in Biryani?<p class="message sent">You can find it with chicken, beef, lamb or even goat. But my favorite is always chicken.<p class=message>I'm not a huge fan of goat, so maybe I'll stick to chicken too.<p class="message sent">The chicken is marinated in yogurt and spices, which makes it tender and flavorful. You won't regret it!<p class=message>I can't wait to try it. Where's the best place to get Biryani around here?<p class="message sent">There's a great Indian restaurant downtown that serves amazing Biryani. We should go there sometime!<p class=message>That sounds like a plan. Do they serve it with any sides?<p class="message sent">Yes, it usually comes with raita, which is a yogurt and cucumber sauce, and sometimes with some papadum, which is a crispy flatbread.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds delicious. I can't wait to try it all together.<p class="message sent">It's going to be a Biryani feast! Just make sure you don't fill up too much on the rice, there's still a lot more to enjoy.<p class=message>I'll try my best! Thanks for introducing me to this amazing dish.<p class="message sent">No problem at all! I'm glad we share the love of Biryani.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9f646d3f-cf92-421e-adba-9c055988ad0d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
