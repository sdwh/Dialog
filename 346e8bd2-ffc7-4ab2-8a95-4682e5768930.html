I love it. Why do you ask?<p class=message>I've been meaning to try it out for the longest time. What do you usually get in your Bento box?<p class="message sent">Well, there are a lot of options, but my usual go-to is the teriyaki chicken with sushi rolls on the side. How about you?<p class=message>Hmm...I'm still a newbie. I usually just get the chicken karaage and some soba noodles.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's a good combo too! Have you tried the takoyaki?<p class=message>No, but I've heard it's really good. Is it?<p class="message sent">Definitely! But be careful, it's super hot on the inside. I learned that the hard way.<p class=message>Haha, duly noted. So, what do you think makes Bento boxes different from other types of meals?<p class="message sent">I think it's the variety. You get a little bit of everything in one container - protein, carbs, veggies, and sometimes even dessert! Plus, it's visually appealing.<p class=message>That's true, I have seen some pretty impressive-looking Bento boxes on Instagram. Do you think it's better to make your own Bento or to buy it from a restaurant?<p class="message sent">Personally, I like buying it from a restaurant because it saves me time and all the ingredients are already prepped. But making your own Bento can be fun too, especially if you like cooking.<p class=message>I see. Maybe I'll give homemade Bento boxes a try one of these days. Thanks for the recommendation, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Let me know how it turns out. And in the meantime, let's plan a Bento lunch date soon!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=346d516f-072c-452f-bea7-22620ae6ec4d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
