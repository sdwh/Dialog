I am excited to try some authentic Japanese cuisine.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. We're starting with tempura, famous here in Tokyo. Have you tried it before?<p class=message>Yes, I have. But I am eager to try the local flavor. The batter is so crispy and light. I love the way it's perfectly fried.<p class="message sent">That's right. Here, they use a blend of sesame oil and soybean oil and so the taste is absolutely delicious. So, would you like some wasabi with this?<p class=message>I am feeling adventurous, so yes please.<p class="message sent">Great! Just remember, wasabi can be quite strong, so I'd suggest you to take a small amount first.<p class=message>Oh wow, that's really spicy! But it's definitely clearing my sinuses.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yes, A, that's wasabi for you. Next, I think it's time for the most famous sushi in Tokyo, the nigiri. Do you see how it's so delicately prepared?<p class=message>Indeed, it looks stunning on the plate. I had to try the tuna and salmon sushi. They're beautifully presented and taste spectacular.<p class="message sent">Yes, Japan is renowned for its seafood and sushi. And do you know that it's customary to dip the fish side of the sushi into the soy sauce, not the rice?<p class=message>I didn't know that, thank you for sharing this with me. I am learning a lot about the food and culture here.<p class="message sent">Yes! That's the beauty of travelling, you get to experience new cultures and learn new ways of doing things. Speaking of culture, let me tell you about omotenashi, the traditional Japanese style of hospitality.<p class=message>I am interested, please tell me more.<p class="message sent">Omotenashi literally means “to treat guests wholeheartedly”. It's a Japanese mindset of heartfelt hospitality, where guests' comfort and satisfaction are the topmost priority. It's believed to be a fundamental part of Japan's social fabric and living heritage.<p class=message>That's fascinating. I can sense this level of hospitality from the food quality and service at this restaurant.<p class="message sent">That's right. Japanese people take great pride in their traditional culture of hospitality, which is why they go to great lengths to ensure that every guest feels cared for and valued.<p class=message>Thank you, B, for sharing all these insightful cultural tidbits. I feel like I have a deeper appreciation for the local people and their customs, as well as the delicious food.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure, A. This is a small taste of what Tokyo has to offer, and there's so much more to explore. So, shall we have some dessert now and then plan our next food adventure?</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aef08bf9-a0d3-48b5-87ef-77eef107dfd2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
