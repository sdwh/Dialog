How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Prof! It was great, thanks! I went hiking with some friends. How was yours?<p class=message>Mine was nice as well. I caught a great movie and spent some time with family. So, let's talk about your research plan. What are your ideas?<p class="message sent">I'm thinking of studying the effects of caffeine on memory. Specifically, how different amounts of caffeine might impact recall ability.<p class=message>That's interesting. What kind of subjects do you have in mind?<p class="message sent">I was thinking of using college students as participants. They're often frequent coffee drinkers and we could examine the effects of different amounts of caffeine on their memory recall.<p class=message>That sounds like a solid plan. We could use a simple recall test to measure the subjects' memory, and vary the levels of caffeine intake. I think this could be a really valuable contribution to the field.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Prof! I'm excited to get started.<p class=message>Great, let's set up a timeline and I'll help you get started with the necessary resources. Maybe we can even share a cup of joe during our next meeting to stay energized!<p class="message sent">Absolutely, that sounds perfect! Thanks, Prof!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e26da200-07f1-4111-ae82-fd3a715e311f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
