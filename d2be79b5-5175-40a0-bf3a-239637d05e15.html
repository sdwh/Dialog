How are you feeling today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Actor A. I'm feeling great. Ready to shoot some scenes?<p class=message>Absolutely. I'm excited to get back into character.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. We have a few changes to the script today. Are you comfortable with that?<p class=message>Of course, I'm always up for a challenge. What changes are we talking about?<p class="message sent">Well, we thought it would be fun to add in a scene where your character sings karaoke.<p class=message>*laughs* Karaoke? That's unexpected. But okay, I'm up for it.<p class="message sent">Great. We also need to work on your fight scene. Can we take a look at that now?<p class=message>Sure thing. Let's get started.<p class="message sent">Okay, remember to keep your movements sharp and precise. And try to add in some emotion too.<p class=message>Got it. How about 'I'm going to crush you, villain!' as I throw a punch?<p class="message sent">*laughs* That's perfect. We'll work on that. How about we take a break and get some coffee?<p class=message>Sounds good to me. Oh, and have you seen the new cat that's hanging around the set?<p class="message sent">You mean the one that's been stealing our food? Yeah, I've seen it.<p class=message>*laughs* Yeah, that's the one. I think we should give it a role in the film.<p class="message sent">Actor A, I'm not sure the audience is ready for a feline actor just yet.<p class=message>Are you sure? Cats are very popular on the internet.<p class="message sent">*laughs* We'll see. Let's finish our coffee and get back to work.<p class=message>Alright, let's do this. I'm ready for my close-up.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d2bc4494-f548-4607-b1df-5c5b15ae7f59.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
