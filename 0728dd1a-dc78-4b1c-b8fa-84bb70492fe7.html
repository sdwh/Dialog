How are you doing today?<p class="message sent message-content">I'm doing great, A! Ready to start serving some delicious drinks.<p class="message received message-content">Wonderful! What do you recommend today?<p class="message sent message-content">The matcha latte is really popular right now, and the weather makes it perfect. But, if you want something more refreshing, we have the lemonade with a twist - ginger and mint.<p class="message received message-content">Hmm, that does sound refreshing. I think I'll go with that.<p class="message sent message-content">Great choice! Anything else you would like to add in that?<p class="message received message-content">Sure, can you add some strawberry syrup to it as well?<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely. That would add a sweet and tangy kick to your drink. Anything else?<p class="message received message-content">Yes, can you also make me a mocha frappe?<p class="message sent message-content">No problem. Would you like whipped cream and chocolate drizzle on top?<p class="message received message-content">Of course! I can't resist those.<p class="message sent message-content">I don't blame you. Who can say no to whipped cream and chocolate? Your total comes out to $8.50.<p class="message received message-content">Sounds good. Here you go. Keep the change.<p class="message sent message-content">Thank you so much, A. Enjoy your drinks and have a great day.<p class="message received message-content">Thanks, B. You too.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0725ee37-89ad-4f6d-86c6-99e250241c3c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
