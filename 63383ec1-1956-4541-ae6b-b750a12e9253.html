How's it going, B?<p class="message sent">Hi there! It's going well, thanks for asking. What can I do for you today?<p class=message>I have a fresh batch of strawberry shortcake that I'd like to pair with a nice cup of coffee. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Our medium roast blend pairs really nicely with the sweetness of the strawberry shortcake. Would you like it as a latte or an americano?<p class=message>A latte, please. And maybe a cappuccino for myself afterward.<p class="message sent">Good choices! So, how has business been for you today?<p class=message>It's been steady, I can't complain. I have a lot of regulars who love my desserts, so that always makes me happy.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear! Our regulars always keep us going too. I feel like I'm serving coffee to half of Osaka city!<p class=message>Haha, I know what you mean. Is there any particular coffee that is a hit with most of your customers?<p class="message sent">The most popular is definitely the caramel macchiato. People just can't get enough of that sweet, warm taste.<p class=message>Oh, sounds like I need to give that a try next time. Speaking of favorites, what's your favorite dessert that I make?<p class="message sent">Definitely the matcha roll cake. I love the creamy, earthy taste of matcha, and the way it complements the lightness of the cake is just perfect.<p class=message>That's one of my favorites too, actually. It's always a hit at weddings and other special events.<p class="message sent">I can imagine! It's honestly too pretty to eat sometimes.<p class=message>Haha, I'll take that as a compliment. I always try to make desserts that are both beautiful and delicious.<p class="message sent">Well, you definitely succeed! Your creations always look like works of art.<p class=message>Thank you so much! It really means a lot to me to hear that.<p class="message sent">Anytime. So, how's your family doing? Everyone staying healthy?<p class=message>Yes, thankfully everyone is doing well. How about your family?<p class="message sent">Same here, thank goodness. We're all taking extra care to stay healthy these days.<p class=message>Definitely. It's such a strange time, but I'm grateful to have good health and good people around me.<p class="message sent">Same here. There's nothing like a good cup of coffee and a delicious dessert to bring a little bit of joy into the world, right?<p class=message>Absolutely! And on that note, here's to a wonderful rest of the day. Cheers!<p class="message sent">Cheers to you too. Enjoy your strawberry shortcake and latte!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=63382da1-3c1e-4035-88ae-d43668ab296d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
