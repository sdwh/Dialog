Thank you for coming in today.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Officer. What can I help you with?<p class=message>We have reason to believe that you were involved in a theft last night. Can you tell me where you were between 8 and 10 pm?<p class="message sent">Actually, Officer, I was at home playing video games all evening.<p class=message>Hmm, that's interesting. Do you mind if we take a look at your gaming console and check the time stamps?<p class="message sent">Go ahead, my console is in the living room. But I already know what you'll find - I was too busy saving the world from destruction to steal anything.<p class=message>Looks like you're telling the truth, Mr. B. Do you have any leads on who might have actually committed the theft?<p class="message sent">No, Officer, I don't. But I'll keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior in the neighborhood.<p class=message>Thank you, that would be helpful. Just to be safe, we might need to do a lineup later on.<p class="message sent">Sure, no problem. As long as I can still save the world in between questioning.<p class=message>Ha! I like your sense of humor, Mr. B. But seriously, we'll be in touch if we need anything else.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Officer.
