How about yours?<p class=message>It's been busy, but I'm glad we finally have some time to discuss our business strategy.<p class="message sent">Me too. What's on the agenda today?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking we could brainstorm some new ideas for marketing our product.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I've been doing some research on our target audience and I think we could try targeting millennials more effectively.<p class=message>That's a great idea. Speaking of millennials, have you seen the latest meme that's been circulating on social media?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What is it?<p class=message>It's a funny one about people ignoring advertisements. I'll pull it up on my computer and show you.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's hilarious. We need to find a way to make our ads more engaging so people will actually pay attention to them.<p class=message>Exactly. Maybe we could try incorporating some humor into our ad campaigns.<p class="message sent">I like that idea. We could also try running a social media contest to get people talking about our brand.<p class=message>Yes, that's a great idea. We'll definitely have to come up with some creative and funky prize ideas.<p class="message sent">How about a year's worth of free pizza?<p class=message>(laughing) That would definitely get people excited. Let's put that on the list of potential prizes.<p class="message sent">Awesome. I think we're off to a good start with some fresh ideas. Let's keep this momentum going and see what else we can come up with.<p class=message>Agreed. Thanks for your input, B. Let's touch base again next week and keep working on our strategy.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=94537d29-f8af-4a8d-99ff-9fd563827792.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
