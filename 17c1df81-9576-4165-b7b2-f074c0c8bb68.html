How may I assist you today, B?<p class="message sent">Hi there. I have a question about trademark infringement.<p class=message>Alright, let's hear it.<p class="message sent">I recently started selling a product with a unique name and logo. Another company is now selling a similar product with a very similar name and logo. Can they do that?<p class=message>It depends on a few factors. Have you registered your trademark yet?<p class="message sent">No, not yet.<p class=message>That could make it more difficult to establish that the other company is infringing on your intellectual property. However, it's still worth talking to a trademark attorney.<p class="message sent">Okay, that makes sense. Thank you for your advice.<p class=message>Sure thing. On a lighter note, what do you like to do for fun?<p class="message sent">I love cooking and trying out new recipes. How about you?<p class=message>I enjoy playing tennis and reading mystery novels in my free time.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds fun. What's your favorite mystery novel?<p class=message>I'm a big fan of Agatha Christie. My favorite novel of hers is probably "Murder on the Orient Express."<p class="message sent">I've heard of that one but haven't gotten around to reading it yet.<p class=message>You should definitely check it out! Christie's writing is always engaging and keeps you guessing until the very end.<p class="message sent">I will have to do that. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class=message>No problem, happy reading. And don't forget to follow up with us about your trademark question!<p class="message sent">Definitely will do. Thank you again!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=17bb131a-1123-4da4-85ad-0351e8bb1079.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
