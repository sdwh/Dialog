What did you find?<p class=message>It's nothing too serious, just a few SQL injection points and some cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.<p class="message sent">Phew, that's a relief. I was afraid you were going to say we had some major security hole.<p class=message>Yeah, it's nothing that can't be fixed with a few patches. Have you ever done any security work before?<p class="message sent">No, not really. I'm more on the development side of things.<p class=message>Well, don't worry about it. I'll show you what needs to be done and we'll work on it together.<p class="message sent">Awesome, sounds like a plan. You know, sometimes I feel like I'm just one missed semicolon away from causing a major security breach.<p class=message>Haha, I know what you mean. But don't worry, that's why we do these code reviews and vulnerability scans.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's definitely important to stay on top of these things. You know, sometimes I think being a software developer is like being a student - you never stop learning.<p class=message>Absolutely. That's what makes this job so interesting and challenging. There's always something new to learn and improve upon.<p class="message sent">Speaking of learning, have you tried out any new programming languages or frameworks recently?<p class=message>Yeah, I've been playing around with Rust lately. It's pretty cool, but definitely takes some getting used to.<p class="message sent">Nice, I've been interested in learning Python. I hear it's very versatile and widely used in the industry.<p class=message>Definitely. It's a great language to add to your toolkit. Plus, there are so many libraries and tools available for it.<p class="message sent">Well, thanks for all your help with the source code review, A. I'm looking forward to working on those patches together.<p class=message>No problem, B. It's always fun to work on these things together and learn from each other.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=19da8f24-4eea-4414-8e22-cc3b5cddc66f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
