It's going well.<p class=message>That's great to hear. Did you manage to recommend any dishes to our customers?<p class="message sent">I did actually, the chicken peri-peri and the grilled fish were popular choices.<p class=message>Wonderful, those are some of our signature dishes. Did any customers have any special requests?<p class="message sent">One customer asked if we could make their pizza with gluten-free crust and we were able to accommodate their request.<p class=message>Excellent, we pride ourselves on being able to cater to different dietary needs. Is there anything else you need assistance with tonight?<p class="message sent">Not at the moment, everything seems to be running smoothly. Thank you for asking.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. By the way, have you tried our new wine selection yet?<p class="message sent">No, not yet. Which ones do you recommend?<p class=message>Personally, I would suggest the Chenin Blanc or the Pinot Noir. They pair well with some of our specialties.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, I'll have to give those a try. Thanks for the suggestion.<p class=message>Of course, it's always great to try something new. Just let me know if you need anything else.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cd8adaff-ff1f-4fe6-8845-4aecdf5bdd46.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
