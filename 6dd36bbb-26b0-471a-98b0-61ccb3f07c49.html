How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing well, thank you. How about you, A?<p class=message>I'm good too. I'm actually excited to visit Nanjing for the first time.<p class="message sent">That's great! It's a beautiful city. What places are you planning to visit?<p class=message>I would love to see the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and explore the Qinhuai River.<p class="message sent">Those are great choices. You should also try the local food, especially the salted duck.<p class=message>Sounds delicious! Have you tried it?<p class="message sent">Yes, and it's one of my favorite dishes. If you want, I can recommend some good restaurants to try it.<p class=message>That would be awesome, thank you, B. By the way, do you always drive this route?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm very familiar with this route. It's a popular route for both locals and tourists.<p class=message>That's amazing. You must have seen plenty of interesting things during your drives.<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. One time, I even had a passenger who forgot their luggage in my car and I had to return it to them.<p class=message>That's funny! I'm glad you were able to help them out.<p class="message sent">It was a small gesture but it made a big difference to them. I think it's important to always help others when we can.<p class=message>That's a great philosophy. Speaking of helping, do you have any tips for first-time visitors to Nanjing?<p class="message sent">Sure. Always bring extra cash, wear comfortable shoes, and be respectful of the city's culture and customs.<p class=message>Thank you, B. I'll keep those in mind. We're almost there. Thank you for the conversation and the tips.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A. Enjoy your stay in Nanjing and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6dd22bbb-3fd9-4aa5-b367-6ccdde9a7b13.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
