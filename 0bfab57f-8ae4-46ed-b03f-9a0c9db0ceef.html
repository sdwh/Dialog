It found a lot of bugs in our latest project.<p class="message sent">Yeah, but I'm not too worried. We've been through this before. Let's just get to work and fix them one by one.<p class=message>Agreed. But it's always amusing to see what kind of mistakes we make, like that time we accidentally left a "print debug statement" in the production code.<p class="message sent">Haha, yeah. Good thing we caught that before it went live. Remember that one time where our "if" statement was written with a single "=" instead of "=="? That was a nightmare.<p class=message>Oh, don't remind me. That's why we always double-check our verifications. But seriously, how do these bugs even happen?<p class="message sent">Sometimes it's just a simple typo or oversight. Other times, it's a combination of things that go wrong. But that's why we have a review process in place.<p class=message>Yeah, and thank goodness for that. It's better to catch these issues early on than to wait until someone reports a problem with the software.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I always remind myself that building software is like crafting, it takes time and attention to detail, and mistakes are part of the process.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. So, what's the plan? Should we set up a meeting to discuss which bugs need fixing first?<p class="message sent">Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Let's prioritize the issues and make sure we tackle them efficiently. We don't want to miss any of them.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Time to roll up our sleeves and dive into the code! Thanks for your help as always, B.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. We're in this together. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0bfa04c0-55a0-441f-8ab5-b0e303e97a10.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
