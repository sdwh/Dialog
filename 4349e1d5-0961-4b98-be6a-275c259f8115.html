How about we split some fries?<p class=message>Sounds like a plan! So, how's work been for you lately?<p class="message sent">It's been hectic, as usual. But, the highlight of my day is always lunch break.<p class=message>Haha, I can imagine. Did you hear about Karen's new project? She's working on something pretty exciting.<p class="message sent">Oh really? Do tell.<p class=message>It's a secret, but let's just say it involves dogs and online shopping.<p class="message sent">That sounds pretty interesting. Maybe I'll have to ask her about it later.<p class=message>Definitely. So, did you do anything fun over the weekend?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I went to a concert with some friends. The music was amazing.<p class=message>Who did you see?<p class="message sent">It was a local band, but they were really talented. It was a great time.<p class=message>Nice. I haven't been to a concert in ages. Maybe we should plan one soon.<p class="message sent">Yes, we definitely should. It's always fun to jam out to some live music.<p class=message>Agreed. Alright, our food's here. Let's dig in!<p class="message sent">Yum, these fries are so good.
