I'm here to check out.<p class="message sent">Good morning, sir! May I please have your name and room number?<p class=message>My name is John Smith, and my room number is 305.<p class="message sent">Thank you. Can I ask how your stay was here at our hotel?<p class=message>It was great! I have no complaints. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean, and the staff was friendly.<p class="message sent">That's wonderful to hear! May I ask why you're checking out early?<p class=message>Oh, my flight got rescheduled for an earlier time, so I need to leave as soon as possible.<p class="message sent">I understand. I'll just need to confirm that there are no additional charges before you go. Did you use any services like the minibar, room service, or laundry during your stay?<p class=message>I did, actually. I had a few drinks from the minibar and sent some laundry in.<p class="message sent">Alright. I'm just going to check the system to see what the total is...and it looks like there's no additional charge! You're all set to go.<p class=message>Great! Thank you for your help. This was a nice stay, and I'll be sure to recommend this hotel to my colleagues.<p class="message sent">That's wonderful to hear. We hope to see you again soon. Have a safe trip home!<p class=message>Thank you! Goodbye!<p class="message sent">Goodbye!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b951919f-6264-4237-9294-b2399294bde6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
