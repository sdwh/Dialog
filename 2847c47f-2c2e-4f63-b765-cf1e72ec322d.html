Are you looking forward to tonight's shift?<p class="message sent">Yes, Chef A. I always love working in the kitchen with you. What's on the menu tonight?<p class=message>We have our famous grilled salmon with roasted vegetables and a lemon garlic sauce. We also have a new dish - a quinoa salad with cherry tomatoes, cucumber, and feta cheese.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. I'll make sure to recommend it to our guests.<p class=message>Great, let's get started on prepping the ingredients. Could you pass me the salmon fillets, please?<p class="message sent">Sure thing, Chef. By the way, have you tried that new coffee place down the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">Yeah, their double shot espresso is the best I've had in a while. You should give it a try on your break.<p class=message>I just might. Speaking of breaks, how did your weekend go?<p class="message sent">It was good, thanks. I took my dog to the park and then had a barbecue with my family. How about you?<p class=message>I went on a hiking trip with some friends. It was a great way to recharge and get ready for this busy week at work.<p class="message sent">That sounds like fun. Oh, and by the way, table 5 needs an allergy-free meal. They have a guest with a gluten intolerance.<p class=message>Got it. I'll make sure to prepare something special for them.<p class="message sent">Thank you, Chef. Our guests always appreciate the extra effort.<p class=message>It's no problem. We want to make sure everyone leaves here happy and satisfied.<p class="message sent">That's for sure. Alright, let's get back to work. We have some hungry diners waiting for their meals!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2847082d-6731-4faa-ad42-d70dcb023e7b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
