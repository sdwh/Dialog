I'm your tour guide, A.<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm B. I'm so excited to see this famous landmark in person.<p class=message>Yes, the Opera House is definitely a must-see spot in Sydney. Have you ever seen any shows here before?<p class="message sent">No, but I've heard that the acoustics are incredible.<p class=message>You're right! The acoustics are fantastic. And did you know that the Opera House has over 1,000 rooms?<p class="message sent">Wow, that's a lot! How many people can it hold?<p class=message>It can hold up to 5,750 people. That's a lot of seats to fill!<p class="message sent">I can imagine. What's the story behind the unique design of the Opera House?<p class=message>Well, the architect, Jorn Utzon, was inspired by the shape of an orange. He wanted to create a building that reflected the curves and shapes found in nature.<p class="message sent">That's really interesting. Do they still hold operas here?<p class=message>Absolutely! The Opera House hosts a variety of shows and performances, from operas to ballets to plays.<p class="message sent">I would love to see a show here someday. So, what's next on our tour?<p class=message>Next, we'll make our way to the main concert hall. This is where most of the performances take place.<p class="message sent">Sounds exciting! Is the main concert hall as impressive as it looks from the outside?<p class=message>Definitely! The interior design is just as stunning as the exterior. You'll see a lot of wood paneling and custom-made carpeting.<p class="message sent">I can't wait to take a look. Are there any other interesting facts about the Opera House that you can tell me?<p class=message>Sure! Did you know that the Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007?<p class="message sent">No, I didn't know that. That's really cool.<p class=message>And did you know that the construction of the Opera House was actually behind schedule and over budget?<p class="message sent">I had no idea. I bet that caused some stress for the builders and the architect.<p class=message>Yes, it definitely did. But in the end, it was all worth it. The Opera House has become an icon not just for Sydney, but for Australia as a whole.<p class="message sent">I can see why. Thanks for an awesome tour, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=983408ba-efd2-4a86-af30-6273136e793c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
