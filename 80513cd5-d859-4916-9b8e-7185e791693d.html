Seems like there are quite a few findings.<p class=message>Yes, but don't worry, we can take care of them. Let's go through them one by one.<p class="message sent">Sure. The first one is a potential SQL injection vulnerability. We should sanitize our inputs.<p class=message>Good catch. And there's also a cross-site scripting issue. We need to validate our outputs.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Oh, and here's an uninitialized variable warning. We should initialize it properly.<p class=message>Right. And this one is a function with too many arguments. We should refactor it for better readability.<p class="message sent">I agree. And there's a naming convention violation. Let's change it to follow our style guide.<p class=message>Got it. And here's a spelling error in a comment. Let's fix that before it goes to production.<p class="message sent">Great idea. And this one is a dead code block. Let's remove it for a cleaner codebase.<p class=message>Sounds good. And there's a logic error in this function. We should add some more tests to catch it.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Hey, we're almost done. That wasn't so bad, was it?<p class=message>No, not at all. It's always satisfying to catch these things early on.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And it's even more satisfying to have them fixed before they cause any real problems.<p class=message>Agreed. Alright, let's get these fixed up and push the changes to our repo.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Good teamwork, A.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=804e22d9-a5ad-404b-9fe2-9dc99eaf3053.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
