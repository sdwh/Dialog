My name is Alice and I'll be your guide today. Are you excited to explore this iconic landmark?<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely! I've been looking forward to visiting the Opera House for such a long time.<p class=message>Great to hear that! Before we start, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?<p class="message sent">Sure, I'm from Japan and I love traveling around the world. Sydney has been on my bucket list for years and finally, I'm here!<p class=message>Fantastic! I'm so glad you chose to visit us today. Would you like to know a little bit more about the history of the Opera House?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I love learning new things about different cultures.<p class=message>The Sydney Opera House was completed in 1973 and it took 16 years to build. The architect, Jorn Utzon, was from Denmark and he won a competition to design the building.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's amazing! It's such an impressive structure, like nothing I've ever seen before.<p class=message>Yes, the design is really unique and intricate. There are three main performance spaces inside the Opera House, including the Concert Hall, Opera Theatre, and Drama Theatre.<p class="message sent">Do they have different shows on at the same time?<p class=message>Yes, they do! The Opera House hosts a variety of performances, from opera and ballet to contemporary music and theatre.<p class="message sent">That's really cool. What's your favorite performance that you've seen here?<p class=message>I've seen so many amazing shows, but I have to say my favorite was a ballet performance by the Australian Ballet Company. The dancers were absolutely stunning.<p class="message sent">I would love to see a ballet performance here someday. It must be such a special experience.<p class=message>It really is. Now, let's move on to the next part of the tour. We're going to explore the interiors of the Opera House and see some of the beautiful artworks on display.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! I can't wait to see more.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=665c2a63-3d8c-4aae-9b1c-6f9b5acde49d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
