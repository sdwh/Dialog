I'm feeling excited about this upcoming surgery.<p class="message sent">Good morning, Doctor A! So am I. I've made sure that everything we need for the operation is prepared and ready.<p class=message>That's great to hear. You always make my job so much easier!<p class="message sent">I try my best, Doctor A. By the way, have you heard the one about the doctor who always tells jokes to his patients before surgery?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Maybe I should try that out myself.<p class="message sent">The punchline is always something like, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit. Just kidding, it will hurt a lot!"<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious. Maybe we need to lighten the mood a bit before we start the surgery.<p class="message sent">I agree. A little bit of humor can definitely help alleviate the stress of the situation.<p class=message>By the way, how's your family doing, Nurse B?<p class="message sent">They're doing well, thanks for asking. My kids have been keeping me busy with their online classes.<p class=message>Ah, the joys of virtual learning. I'm sure that can be quite a handful.<p class="message sent">It definitely is, but it's always worth it to see how much they're learning.<p class=message>Well, let's get started with the surgery. I have a good feeling about this one.<p class="message sent">Same here, Doctor A. Let's give this patient the best possible care.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=80bbe99b-920a-4ac4-b3e7-268b9401cb28.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
