Do you come here often?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's one of my favorites. I love playing soccer here with my friends.<p class=message>Speaking of soccer, did you know the first soccer game between national teams was played in Scotland in 1872?<p class="message sent">Really? That's interesting. Do you know who won?<p class=message>I think it was a draw, 0-0. But speaking of draws, have you been practicing your drawing skills?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. I drew a picture of us having a picnic here last time.<p class=message>That's awesome! Maybe we can have a real picnic soon. Oh, look at those ducks over there.<p class="message sent">I know, they're so cute. Did you know that ducks have three eyelids?<p class=message>I did not know that. You always have such interesting facts. Speaking of interesting, have you started reading that book I got you for your birthday?<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's really good. I stayed up late last night reading it.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I've been reading a book too, but it's about gardening. Maybe we can plant some vegetables in our backyard.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a fun project. Speaking of projects, did you finish building that birdhouse we started last week?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm working on it. Speaking of work, how's school going for you?<p class="message sent">It's going well. I have a big test next week, but I've been studying hard.<p class=message>I'm sure you'll do great. Speaking of greatness, did you know that Muhammad Ali, one of the greatest boxers of all time, used to jog in this park?<p class="message sent">No way, that's so cool! I didn't know that. Speaking of cool, do you want to get some ice cream before we leave?<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. Let's go.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8111169e-1b13-48e6-8431-fe08abea76ba.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
