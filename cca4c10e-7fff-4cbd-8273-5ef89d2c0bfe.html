I hope you're having a great day today.<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too! Yes, the sun is shining, and it's going to be a beautiful day.<p class=message>Yes, it is! So, how long have you been driving a taxi?<p class="message sent">About 10 years now. It's been an interesting job, to say the least!<p class=message>I can imagine that! Do you have any crazy stories you'd like to share?<p class="message sent">Oh boy, I've got plenty! One time, a couple got into a huge argument in my taxi about what toppings they wanted on their pizza.<p class=message>(laughs) That's hilarious! What did you do?<p class="message sent">I just kept driving and pretended I didn't hear a thing. I figured it was better to let them work it out themselves.<p class=message>(laughs) Smart move! So, are there any places you'd recommend I visit while in Adelaide?<p class="message sent">Definitely! You should check out the Adelaide Botanic Garden. It's beautiful there, especially during this time of year.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. I'll make sure to do that. Anything else?<p class="message sent">Well, the Adelaide Central Market is a must-visit for foodies. You can find all sorts of fresh and delicious local produce there.<p class=message>Yum! I'll definitely have to stop by. Thanks for the recommendations.<p class="message sent">No problem! And if you need a ride to any of those places, just give me a call.<p class=message>Will do! You've been a great driver so far, by the way.<p class="message sent">Thank you, that means a lot. And we're here! Enjoy your stay in Adelaide!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cca494c8-3087-4629-9d5a-737f823999f8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
