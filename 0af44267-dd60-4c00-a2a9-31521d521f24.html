How are you doing today?<p class="message sent message-content">Good morning! I'm doing great, thanks. How about you?<p class="message received message-content">I'm doing well, thank you. I brought some fresh produce from my farm. Would you like to take a look?<p class="message sent message-content">Sure! I always love trying out new local produce. What do you have today?<p class="message received message-content">I have some fresh carrots, lettuce, and kale. And for fruit, I have some juicy strawberries and peaches.<p class="message sent message-content">These look great! How do you recommend cooking the kale?<p class="message received message-content">My personal favorite is to saut√© it in olive oil with some garlic and lemon juice. It's so nutritious and delicious.<p class="message sent message-content">That sounds tasty, I might have to try that! And the strawberries look amazing. How sweet are they?<p class="message received message-content">They're very sweet! They were picked just this morning, so they're as fresh as can be.<p class="message sent message-content">Wow, you really have some great produce here. How much for a bunch of carrots and a container of strawberries?<p class="message received message-content">For the carrots, it's $2 per bunch, and for the strawberries, it's $5 per container. Is that okay with you?<p class="message sent message-content">Sounds fair to me. I'll take both. Thanks!<p class="message received message-content">Great! Thank you for your support. I hope you enjoy them.<p class="message sent message-content">I will, thank you. I'll definitely be back for more next week.<p class="message received message-content">That would be fantastic! Take care, and have a great day.<p class="message sent message-content">You too, thanks again!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0af3f582-5a63-47e8-a102-5f7b7a9fbfdc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
