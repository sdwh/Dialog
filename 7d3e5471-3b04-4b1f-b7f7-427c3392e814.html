What kind of errors did you find?<p class=message>Some null pointer exceptions and some memory leaks.<p class="message sent">Yikes! Those can be really tough to debug. Do you have any plans on fixing them?<p class=message>Yeah, I was thinking of using some automated tools to identify the root causes of these issues.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. We could also use some unit tests to catch these errors before they make it to production.<p class=message>Absolutely. And I was thinking of taking a closer look at the way we're handling memory management.<p class="message sent">That's a good point. It might also be a good idea to review our coding standards and make sure we're writing cleaner code.<p class=message>Definitely. We could probably catch these types of errors earlier in the development lifecycle if we're more consistent with our coding practices.<p class="message sent">For sure. And we might also want to consider refactoring some of our existing code to make it more maintainable.<p class=message>That's a great idea. Refactoring can really help simplify the code and make it easier to debug in the future.<p class="message sent">Agreed. And we should probably also schedule some time for code reviews to catch these types of issues in the future.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's always helpful to have a fresh set of eyes on the code to catch anything we might have missed.<p class="message sent">Well, it looks like we have a plan of attack. Let's get to work and make sure we're delivering high-quality code to our users.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Thanks for your help, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, always happy to help!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7d35f008-fa3d-4b5b-99be-ad52e1affbe3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
