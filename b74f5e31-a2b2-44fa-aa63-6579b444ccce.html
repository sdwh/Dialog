It looks like there are a few issues that we need to address.<p class=message>Yeah, it's always interesting to see what bugs and vulnerabilities pop up during these checks.<p class="message sent">Definitely. But on the bright side, it's better to catch them now than have customers find them later.<p class=message>Agreed. So, what's the plan for fixing these issues?<p class="message sent">Well, the report lists out the code sections that need attention. I was thinking of assigning each issue to the appropriate team member for repair.<p class=message>Sounds like a solid plan. Any ideas on how to ensure these issues don't resurface in the future?<p class="message sent">We can set up some automated testing and continuous integration to detect any similar issues early on.<p class=message>Good point. It'll also save us time in the long run. By the way, did you notice that the report had a funny typo?<p class="message sent">Which one?<p class=message>It said "meow" instead of "now" in one of the sentences.<p class="message sent">Haha, really? That's hilarious. I bet the person responsible for writing that section has a cat.<p class=message>Maybe we should set up a Slack channel just for amusing typos we find during inspections.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! We could call it "Code Goofs" and have a good laugh when we need a quick break.<p class=message>Yes, and it'll help lighten the mood during times of intense coding.<p class="message sent">We should get that set up meow. I mean NOW.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b74864ce-fe92-48a2-aa8c-19b01aeb3ab7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
