I heard we're dealing with a lot of client requests lately.<p class="message sent">Hey A! Yeah, we've been swamped lately. It's been a real challenge to keep up with all the requests.<p class=message>Yeah, I can only imagine. So, what are our options here? How can we handle these requests more efficiently?<p class="message sent">Well, we've already optimized our database to handle the increased load. But I think we need to consider implementing a load balancer to distribute the requests more evenly.<p class=message>Hmm, that sounds like a good idea. Do you have any recommendations on which load balancer to use?<p class="message sent">I've heard good things about NGINX. It's open-source and has a lot of community support.<p class=message>Great, let's give that a try. And in terms of our front-end systems, do we need to make any changes there?<p class="message sent">I think we can optimize our code to reduce the number of requests being sent by the client. Maybe we can implement some caching techniques as well.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. Anything else we can do to improve the situation?<p class="message sent">We should also monitor our system closely and be ready to scale up quickly if the demand continues to increase.<p class=message>Agreed. It's always better to be proactive than reactive. Thanks for your input, B. Let's get to work!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Looking forward to tackling this challenge together.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=874afa98-4109-4f1c-8c6c-a0fd8dc09774.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
