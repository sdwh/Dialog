Wow, it's stunning! Are you thinking about buying it?<p class=message>Yes, I am. But I think it's a bit costly.<p class="message sent">Don't worry about the price, my love. You deserve it. Plus, it's made of genuine ruby!<p class=message>Haha, you're right. I do deserve it. But how do I know it's genuine?<p class="message sent">Well, according to the product description, it's certified by GIA, the Gemological Institute of America. They're known for their strict standards.<p class=message>Okay, that sounds good. But are you sure I should get this necklace?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. You'll look so beautiful wearing it! Plus, it'll match perfectly with that red dress you love to wear.<p class=message>Oh, you're right! Now, let me check if there are any coupons or discount codes available.<p class="message sent">Good idea. I'll keep an eye on the kids while you shop.<p class=message>Haha, thanks for helping. Oh, and while I'm at it, is there anything you'd like me to try to find for you?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. Maybe a new watch. But don't break the bank!<p class=message>Haha, I'll see what I can do.
