What can I offer you today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'll have a cappuccino please. And do you have any recommendations for the pastry?<p class=message>Of course! Our almond croissants are always a popular choice. But if you're feeling adventurous, try our raspberry tart. It's a little tangy and a little sweet.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I think I'll go for the almond croissant. Can't go wrong with a classic!<p class=message>Good choice! And for you, sir?<p class=message>Absolutely! And may I ask, are you visiting Nice or are you a local?<p class="message sent">How are you liking it so far?<p class=message>I'm glad you're enjoying it! What brings you to Nice?<p class="message sent">That sounds lovely. I hope you have a great time while you're here.<p class=message>That's what we're here for. Providing a little bit of joy through pastries and coffee.<p class="message sent">Speaking of joy, have you tried our new blueberry scone? It's so buttery and flaky, with just the right amount of sweetness.<p class=message>Yes, it's been a hit with our regular customers. We like to mix things up and offer new treats every season.<p class="message sent">We'd love to have you back! And don't forget to try some other local delights, like socca or pissaladi√®re.<p class=message>And if you need any recommendations, feel free to ask us or the locals. We're always happy to help.<p class="message sent">It was our pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your vacation!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d5deccef-0acc-491c-bbf0-eef144339b06.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
