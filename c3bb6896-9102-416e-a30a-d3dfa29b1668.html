We were performing surgery on a patient's heart.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds intense. Did everything go smoothly?<p class="message sent">Yes, Nurse L was a great help. She passed me the necessary tools and kept an eye on the patient's vitals.<p class=message>That's really cool. I wish I could see what goes on in the operating room.<p class="message sent">It's definitely not for the faint of heart, but it's exciting to be a part of such a crucial process.<p class=message>I'm sure it takes a lot of skill and training to be a nurse or a doctor.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We have to constantly update our knowledge and techniques to provide the best care for our patients.<p class=message>Speaking of patients, have you ever had one that made you laugh during surgery?<p class="message sent">(laughs) Actually, yes. I once had a patient who started singing during the anesthesia process.<p class=message>No way! What did they sing?<p class="message sent">"Don't Stop Believing" by Journey. It was a pleasant surprise to say the least.<p class=message>(laughs) That's amazing. I bet it made the surgery a lot more fun.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's moments like those that make me appreciate my job even more.<p class=message>I can imagine. Well, keep up the great work, Dr. B!<p class="message sent">Thank you, A.
