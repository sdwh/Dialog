It's nice to meet you. I'm a front-end engineer. What brings you here?<p class="message sent">Hi! I'm a UI/UX designer. Nice to meet you too. I love coming to coffee shops for inspiration. How about you?<p class=message>Same here! I find it relaxing to work outside the office sometimes. So, what kind of websites do you usually work on?<p class="message sent">Mostly e-commerce and social media sites. How about you? What's your favorite kind of website to build?<p class=message>I like working on responsive sites that can adapt to any screen size. It's really satisfying to see everything fit neatly on a smaller device.<p class="message sent">That's awesome! In my line of work, I focus a lot on user experience. Do you think about that much as a front-end engineer?<p class=message>Definitely! I always try to make sure the website is easy to use and navigate. It's important for the user to feel comfortable with the site.<p class="message sent">Yes, absolutely! A great user experience can influence whether someone decides to come back to the site or not. What kind of tools do you use for front-end development?<p class=message>I mainly use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What about you?<p class="message sent">I use tools like Sketch, InVision, and Figma. They're great for creating prototypes and testing out design ideas.<p class=message>I've heard of those tools before, and they seem really helpful. One thing I always struggle with though is choosing the right color scheme. How do you go about that?<p class="message sent">Well, I usually pick a base color that I really like, and then use a website like Coolors to find complementary colors. It's really helpful and makes the process much faster.<p class=message>That's a great tip. I'll definitely have to try that out next time. Thanks for sharing!<p class="message sent">No problem! It's always great to share ideas and learn from each other.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b03e5bc9-f91b-4109-98a6-b9d45174d12f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
