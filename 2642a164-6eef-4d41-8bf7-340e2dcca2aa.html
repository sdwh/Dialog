How are you?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A. I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thank you. I wanted to get your thoughts on our school's education policy.<p class="message sent">Sure, what specifically are we discussing?<p class=message>I'm thinking about implementing a new initiative aimed at promoting creativity among our students. What do you think?<p class="message sent">I think it's a great idea. Creativity is such an important skill for our students to develop.<p class=message>That's exactly what I was thinking. I also want to make sure that we're encouraging critical thinking as well.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Our students need to learn how to think independently and for themselves.<p class=message>Agreed. And I think we can achieve that by diversifying our teaching methods and curriculum.<p class="message sent">Yes, we should expose our students to a variety of subjects and topics to help broaden their perspectives.<p class=message>Exactly. And speaking of broadening perspectives, have you heard about that new immersive language program?<p class="message sent">You mean the one where students can study abroad for a semester?<p class=message>Yes, that's the one. What are your thoughts on that?<p class="message sent">I think it's a wonderful opportunity for our students to experience different cultures and learn a new language.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. It's important for our students to be global citizens and have an appreciation for diversity.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A. And with these initiatives, we'll be providing our students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for success in the future.<p class=message>I couldn't have said it better myself, B. Thank you for your input on this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=26418e68-06c6-478c-9e72-58c36f8dcead.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
