How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks for asking. So, let's talk about your case.<p class="message sent">Sure. I'm a bit nervous, but I trust your expertise.<p class=message>Don't worry, B. We'll get through this together. So, have you been keeping up with your paperwork and documentation?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've been organizing my files and collecting receipts, like you advised.<p class=message>Excellent. That will definitely make our job easier. Now, onto more important matters. Have you tried that new sushi place down the street? I heard their rolls are amazing.<p class="message sent">(laughs) No, I haven't. Maybe we should celebrate winning the case there once it's over.<p class=message>(laughs) I like your thinking, B. It's always good to have something to look forward to. Speaking of which, have you listened to any good podcasts lately?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually. There's one about true crime that I find really intriguing.<p class=message>(raises eyebrows) That definitely sounds interesting. Maybe I'll have to give it a listen myself. But for now, let's focus on your case.<p class="message sent">Right. Sorry about that.<p class=message>No need to apologize, B. We can always chat more later. Let's get to work and see what we can do. But first, I need a coffee. Want to join me at the caf√© downstairs?<p class="message sent">(smiling) Sounds like a plan.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f19e292f-f36a-4363-9b5e-a2faaae42643.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
