How far is it to Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Sir! It's about an hour and a half drive from here. Are you heading to Tokyo on business or pleasure?<p class=message>Pleasure. I'm meeting a friend there and we're going to explore the city.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds like fun! What places are you planning to visit?<p class=message>We're planning to go to the Shibuya crossing, the Tokyo Skytree, and the Tokyo Tower. How about you, what's your favorite spot in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">I love going to Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. It's a peaceful oasis in the middle of the bustling city.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. I might stop by there too. Do you have any recommendations for good food in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">You should definitely try some of the local sushi and ramen shops. They're some of the best in the world.<p class=message>I've heard that! I can't wait to try some. Oh, and what's your favorite music to listen to while driving?<p class="message sent">I love listening to jazz music. It's so relaxing and helps me concentrate on the road.<p class=message>I agree. Jazz is really soothing. Hey, have you ever had any interesting passengers in your taxi before?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've had all sorts of interesting people in my taxi. Once, I even had a famous pop star ride with me.<p class=message>That must have been exciting! Did you get to take a picture with them?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, no. It was against company policy. But it was a great experience nonetheless.<p class=message>I can only imagine. Well, we're almost there. Thanks for the great conversation and for driving us safely.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, Sir. Have a great time in Tokyo!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1505b1ff-4b7f-472f-ae91-850e658b0d38.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
