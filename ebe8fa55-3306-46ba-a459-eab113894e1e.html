I will be your pilot for the flight today.<p class="message sent">Hi! Thanks for having me. I'm excited to get going.<p class=message>Great! Before we take off, we need to go through some safety procedures. Have you flown with us before?<p class="message sent">No, this is my first time. But I've flown a few times before.<p class=message>Perfect. Then you'll be familiar with the safety instructions. Please follow along with me as we go through them.<p class="message sent">Sure thing. Anything I can do to make the flight safer.<p class=message>First, please fasten your seatbelt and ensure that your tray table is stowed and your seat is in the upright position.<p class="message sent">Got it. All secure here.<p class=message>Great! In the case of an emergency, oxygen masks will drop from the compartment above your seat. Please place the mask over your nose and mouth and secure it before assisting others.<p class="message sent">Okay, got it. Oxygen masks first before helping others.<p class=message>That's correct. And now for the exits. We have four emergency exits, two at the front and two at the back of the plane. Please familiarize yourself with the nearest exit to you.<p class="message sent">I see them over there. Noted my nearest exits.<p class=message>Fantastic. And lastly, please do not hesitate to contact one of our crew members should you require assistance during the flight.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, thank you for the reminder.<p class=message>It's always good to review the safety measures, even for frequent flyers like you. Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ebe55ece-f3ff-4044-a257-cf0e3401ad09.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
