Just hoping for some good traffic on the way to Atlanta.<p class=message>That's always a plus. So, have you always been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">No, actually. I used to work in finance before I realized how much I enjoy driving.<p class=message>Oh wow, that's quite the shift. Have you always lived in this city?<p class="message sent">Yes, born and raised. What about you? Are you from around here?<p class=message>No, I'm just visiting for work. I've never been to Atlanta before.<p class="message sent">You'll have to let me know if you need any recommendations. I know the best places to eat around here.<p class=message>That would be amazing! What's your favorite restaurant in town?<p class="message sent">Oh definitely Mary Mac's Tea Room. They've got the best southern comfort food around.<p class=message>I'll have to check that out. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">Anytime. So, what brings you to Atlanta for work?<p class=message>I'm attending a conference on digital marketing. It's been really interesting so far.<p class="message sent">Oh cool, my niece works in marketing too. Do you like it?<p class=message>Yeah, it's a fun field. Always something new to learn and explore.<p class="message sent">That's awesome. You'll have to tell me more about it as we get closer to the city.<p class=message>Sure thing! And hey, we're making pretty good time, aren't we?<p class="message sent">Yeah, not bad at all. I'll get you there in no time.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=43f4b47a-513b-4551-a38a-47c2ccf87572.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
