Which one do you think is the bestseller here?<p class="message sent">Hi ma'am! If you're a steak lover, I would definitely recommend the ribeye. It's one of our popular dishes and it comes with a side of mashed potatoes and saut√©ed vegetables.<p class=message>Hmm, that sounds delicious. Would you also suggest a good red wine to pair with it?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! If you're going for a rich and bold taste, I'd suggest our house favorite Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a perfect match with the juicy flavor of the ribeye.<p class=message>That sounds like a great idea. But honestly, I'm not really a wine connoisseur. Can you tell me more about its taste?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! It has a deep purple color with hints of black cherry, vanilla, and oak. It's a perfect balance of tannins and acidity, which makes it easy to drink even for non-wine drinkers.<p class=message>Wow, you're quite the expert! Alright, I'll take the ribeye with the Cabernet Sauvignon. Thank you for the recommendation.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, ma'am! I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Let me know if you need anything else.<p class=message>Actually, can you also suggest a dessert to cap off my meal?<p class="message sent">Of course. If you like chocolate, you should try our lava cake. It's warm and gooey on the inside and topped with vanilla ice cream.<p class=message>Mmm, that sounds heavenly. Alright, I'll have the lava cake as well. Thanks again!<p class="message sent">My pleasure, ma'am. I'll place your order now and it'll be out in a few minutes.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3eb9d300-dfde-4ea8-9cef-8c7b88db8e5f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
