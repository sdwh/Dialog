It's like every website has its own bouncer now.<p class=message>Yeah, exactly! It's almost like the internet is one giant nightclub.<p class="message sent">Except this club has way more hackers than drunken idiots.<p class=message>Haha, so true. But I guess that’s where cybersecurity comes in, right?<p class="message sent">That and a good firewall. What do you look for in a secure website?<p class=message>Well, for starters, a green padlock in the browser bar is always a good sign.<p class="message sent">Yes, that means the website has an SSL certificate, and your information is encrypted.<p class=message>Exactly! And you can never go wrong with using two-factor authentication.<p class="message sent">Totally agree. It’s the ultimate wingman when it comes to online security.<p class=message>And it doesn't hurt to use complex passwords too.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And you know what else helps? Regularly updating your software and anti-virus.<p class=message>Bingo! That's how you stay one step ahead of the hackers.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, did you hear about that company that got hacked for like a bazillion dollars?<p class=message>Yeah, I did! That's why it's so important to have airtight security measures in place.<p class="message sent">Exactly. We can’t let those online creeps win!<p class=message>Agreed. So, have you been binge-watching anything good lately?<p class="message sent">Haha, a sudden change of topic, but yeah, I've been watching "Stranger Things" on Netflix. What about you?<p class=message>Nice! I'm still hooked on "Game of Thrones." Can't believe it's almost over though.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it's a bittersweet ending for sure. But hey, at least we can binge-watch it anytime we want, knowing our online security is top-notch.<p class=message>Haha, you're right about that. Alright, catch you later!<p class="message sent">See ya, buddy!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3d3ee359-9e1c-4725-9eb2-13d80ed99a5d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
