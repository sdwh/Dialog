How's it going?<p class="message sent">It's going well. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great. So, shall we start discussing the design for the e-commerce website?<p class="message sent">Sure, let's get started. What kind of design are you thinking about?<p class=message>I'm thinking of a clean and modern design. We should keep it simple.<p class="message sent">I completely agree. Simple designs work best for e-commerce websites.<p class=message>Yes, and we need to make sure that the user experience is smooth and easy to navigate.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We don't want our customers to get lost on the website.<p class=message>Correct. We need to make sure that the website is user-friendly and easy to use.<p class="message sent">That's very important. What about the color scheme?<p class=message>For the color scheme, I'm thinking a combination of blue and white. It's clean and professional.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. We can also add some pops of color to add some personality.<p class=message>Good idea! Let's also make sure to have high-quality product photos.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we need to ensure that the loading speed is fast.<p class=message>Agreed. That's a key factor in retaining customers.<p class="message sent">What about the font style and size?<p class=message>The font should be easy to read and not too small, maybe something like Open Sans.<p class="message sent">I like that font. We should also make sure that the website is responsive on mobile devices.<p class=message>Absolutely. More and more people are shopping through their phones.<p class="message sent">Okay, let's start working on the wireframes and then move onto the design.<p class=message>Great. And don't forget, we need to add some engaging calls-to-action to persuade customers to make a purchase.<p class="message sent">Yes, we want our customers to have a positive experience on the website and keep coming back.<p class=message>Bingo! Alright, let's dive right into it then.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dcddc55f-03e9-4ef7-b210-17a807df940a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
