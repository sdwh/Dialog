I think I have a stomachache.<p class="message sent">Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that, kiddo. Do you remember what you ate for lunch today?<p class=message>I had a sandwich with peanut butter and jelly, and some apple slices.<p class="message sent">Hmm, I don't think that should be the cause of your stomachache. Did you drink enough water today?<p class=message>I had a glass with lunch and another one at recess.<p class="message sent">That sounds like enough water. Maybe you just have a little bug or ate something that didn't agree with you.<p class=message>But I don't want to be sick! Can we have something for dinner that is easy to digest?<p class="message sent">Of course, how about some chicken noodle soup? It's always a good choice for upset tummies.<p class=message>Yay, I love chicken noodle soup! Thanks, Dad.<p class="message sent">No problem, sweetie. And if you're still not feeling well tomorrow, we'll take a trip to the doctor.<p class=message>Okay, but I'm sure I'll feel better after some soup. Maybe I was just too excited during gym class today.<p class="message sent">That could be it too. Remember to take it easy and rest tonight. And don't worry, we'll make sure you're good as new in no time.<p class=message>Thanks, Dad. You're the best.<p class="message sent">You're the best too, kid. Now let's go make some soup!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b7e455f9-1a1b-461c-8133-12838612bc38.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
