Do you have any recommendations?<p class=message>How about the hotel conference room downtown?<p class="message sent">Hm, that could work. Do you know how much they charge?<p class=message>Yeah, it's a little pricey, but it includes all the amenities we need.<p class="message sent">Well, we can't break the bank. Let's keep looking. What about the local community center?<p class=message>I'm not sure if they have the proper technology for our presentation.<p class="message sent">Good point. Maybe the university has rooms available for rent.<p class=message>That's a great idea. Let's check it out. Do you prefer a certain location on campus?<p class="message sent">We want to make it convenient for everyone, so maybe a central location would be best.<p class=message>Okay, I'll give the university a call and see what they have available.<p class="message sent">Great, and let me know the cost as well. We don't want to exceed our budget.<p class=message>Will do. Oh, speaking of budget, do you think we should provide catering or let people bring their own lunch?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. I think providing food would make the meeting run smoother, but it might cost a lot. What do you think?<p class=message>Well, we could always ask attendees to chip in for the cost, or we could provide some snacks and refreshments instead.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that could work. Let's make sure we send out an email to everyone with the details.<p class=message>Agreed. And while we're at it, let's remind them to RSVP so we can get a head count for the catering.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Oh, and we should also make sure the room we rent has enough seating and tables for everyone.<p class=message>Good catch. I'll double-check that when I call the university.<p class="message sent">Sounds like we're getting everything in order for this meeting. I can't wait to see how it turns out.<p class=message>Me too! It's going to be a great opportunity for us to discuss new projects and ideas.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f6963804-3f94-4c56-895c-8f2ff82462bd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
