Have you taken the gold level exam before?<p class=message>No, but I’m planning to take it soon. What about you?<p class="message sent">I’ve taken it once before, but unfortunately, I didn’t pass.<p class=message>That’s alright. Don't be discouraged. The exam is notoriously difficult.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I realized that. But I’m determined to try again and pass it this time.<p class=message>Good for you! Have you been studying for it?<p class="message sent">Yes, I’ve been using some TOEIC prep books and also doing some practice tests online.<p class=message>That’s a great idea. I’ve heard that practicing with past exams is really helpful.<p class="message sent">Definitely. How about you? Have you started studying for it?<p class=message>Not yet, but I plan to start soon. I’ve been busy with work lately.<p class="message sent">I know how you feel. It’s hard to balance work and studying.<p class=message>True. But I really want to improve my English skills and get certified.<p class="message sent">Me too. Plus, having a TOEIC certificate can open up a lot of job opportunities.<p class=message>Exactly. I’ve heard that many companies require employees to have a certain level of English proficiency.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that’s why I think it’s worth investing time and effort into studying for the TOEIC exam.<p class=message>I couldn’t agree more. Let’s both work hard and aim to pass the gold level exam!<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan! I’ll see you at the exam venue.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=46e68d35-29c5-471e-b923-3c20a428460f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
