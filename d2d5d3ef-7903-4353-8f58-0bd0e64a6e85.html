I heard we're designing an app for online booking and check-in. Exciting, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Definitely! It's about time we bring the airline industry up to speed with modern technology.<p class=message>So, I was thinking of building the app on a cloud-based platform. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. It'll make it easier to manage and scale the app.<p class=message>And we could use a database to store all the passenger information, flight schedules, and seat assignments.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. We want to avoid any issues with double bookings and other errors.<p class=message>Exactly. Plus, we could integrate a payment gateway to allow customers to pay for their tickets online.<p class="message sent">I like the sound of that. It'll make the booking process more seamless and convenient for everyone.<p class=message>And don't forget about the mobile check-in. We could send push notifications to remind customers to check-in before their flight.<p class="message sent">That'll definitely be a helpful feature. We want to make sure that everyone gets to their destination on time.<p class=message>Lastly, we could incorporate a feedback system in the app. This way, customers can tell us how their experience was and what we could improve on.<p class="message sent">Awesome! Overall, I think we have some great ideas here. It's just a matter of bringing them all together and making them work seamlessly.<p class=message>Agreed. This app will revolutionize the way passengers travel, and I'm excited to be a part of it.<p class="message sent">Same here. Let's get to work and make it happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d2d4c2c5-acf7-41aa-baf3-c53a390c07e7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
