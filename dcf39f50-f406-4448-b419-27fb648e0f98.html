Where can I take you today?<p class="message sent">Thanks! Can you please take me to Willis Tower?<p class=message>Sure thing! Just a quick reminder, in Chicago, we drive on the right-hand side of the road. The speed limit is usually 30 miles per hour unless otherwise posted.<p class="message sent">Got it, thanks for the heads up. It's different from where I come from.<p class=message>Yeah, it can take some getting used to. Also, remember to always wear your seatbelt and keep your cell phone off while driving.<p class="message sent">Definitely. What about pedestrians?<p class=message>Pedestrians have the right of way at crosswalks and intersections, so always be on the lookout for them.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. And what's the deal with turning right on a red light?<p class=message>Ah, the infamous Chicago right turn. You can turn right on red unless there's a no right turn sign or pedestrians are crossing the street.<p class="message sent">Good to know. Thanks for explaining all that. It's really helpful.<p class=message>No problem! I always want my passengers to feel safe and comfortable when riding with me. Anything else you'd like to know about the traffic rules here in Chicago?<p class="message sent">That covers it for now, but I'll definitely keep all this in mind.<p class=message>Great! Oh, and one more thing. Have you heard about the famous Chicago-style hot dogs?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's so special about them?<p class=message>They're a local specialty. They come topped with all sorts of delicious things like onions, pickles, and spicy peppers. You should give them a try while you're here.<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing. I'll definitely have to try one. Thanks for the recommendation!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dcf0050a-87e4-4e9b-b320-b7bc930427a7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
