It's great to see you here in our restaurant.<p class="message sent">Hi A! Thanks for having me over. I'm excited to learn some sushi-making tips from you.<p class=message>Of course, I'm happy to share my knowledge. Let's start with the basics. Do you know the difference between nigiri and maki?<p class="message sent">Yes, I'm familiar with them. Nigiri is a hand-formed sushi with a slice of fish on top, while maki is a sushi roll with rice and filling wrapped in seaweed.<p class=message>Impressive! You'll make a great sushi chef someday. Now let's try making some nigiri. First, you need to form a small ball of rice, then add a dab of wasabi on top.<p class="message sent">Got it. Then what's next?<p class=message>Finally, you place a slice of fish on top - salmon, tuna, and eel are some popular choices. Oh, and don't forget to wet your hands before handling the rice.<p class="message sent">Wow, it's harder than it looks. But with practice, I think I can get the hang of it.<p class=message>Absolutely! Now, would you like to try making some rice balls for our onigiri dish?<p class="message sent">Yes please, I love onigiri! What are the fillings we can use?<p class=message>We have pickled plums, grilled salmon, and seasoned seaweed among others. Choose your preferred filling and let's get started.<p class="message sent">This is a lot easier than making nigiri. I can't wait to taste the final product.<p class=message>Great job, B! That was impressive. I think you have a talent for sushi-making.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A! I might have a new career path to explore. But for now, let's enjoy the fruits of our labor.<p class=message>Agreed. Let's go find a table and sample some of our delicious sushi and onigiri!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9952d7a8-4b35-4142-aeea-564d41bcbdca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
