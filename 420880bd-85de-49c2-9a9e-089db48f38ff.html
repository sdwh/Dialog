How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! It was great. I went to a Japanese tea ceremony and tried lots of different teas.<p class=message>That sounds fascinating. Speaking of tea, have you tried our new matcha éclairs?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They're delicious! And they pair perfectly with a cup of our matcha tea.<p class=message>I'm glad you think so. I was a bit nervous about combining French pastry with Japanese tea culture.<p class="message sent">You don't need to worry. Both flavors compliment each other nicely. Who knew that French éclairs could taste so good with matcha!<p class=message>I'm glad to hear it. And your pure matcha tea is the perfect complement to our pastries.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A. It's imported directly from Kyoto, Japan. I take great care in serving only the best quality tea to our customers.<p class=message>I can see that. You're a true master in the art of tea-making. By the way, have you tried our raspberry macarons yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. They're fantastic! The sweetness is perfectly balanced with the tanginess of the raspberries.<p class=message>Ah, I'm so happy to hear that. I put a lot of effort into perfecting the recipe.<p class="message sent">Your pastry skills are a match for my tea-making skills, A! Together we make a great team.<p class=message>Indeed we do, B. And our customers agree. They can't get enough of our unique pairing of French pastry and Japanese tea.<p class="message sent">I'm glad to hear that. We're putting a unique spin on things, and it's truly paying off.<p class=message>Absolutely. It's exciting to work together and create something special that people can't get anywhere else.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more, A. Let's keep up the great work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4206d6f7-8890-4d1b-82eb-7175387dd7b9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
