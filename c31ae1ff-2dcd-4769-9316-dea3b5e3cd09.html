You're the horticulturalist, right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's me. And you're the architect?<p class=message>Yep, that's me. I heard we're designing a park together?<p class="message sent">Yes, we are! It's going to be built on a hilltop.<p class=message>Sounds like a beautiful location. What's the first thing that comes to your mind?<p class="message sent">We should definitely consider the natural landscape and try to blend the park with the surroundings.<p class=message>Absolutely. Maybe we could consider designing a hiking trail that goes around the hill so that visitors can appreciate the view from different angles.<p class="message sent">Ooh, that sounds like an awesome idea. Let's make sure we keep some of the existing trees and vegetation to give it a natural feel. Maybe we can even add some benches in areas with great views for people to sit and enjoy the scenery.<p class=message>That's perfect. And what about a water feature? Maybe a little fountain or a pond?<p class="message sent">Yes, adding a water feature would be a great idea. We could put it in the middle of the park and surround it with some colourful plants.<p class=message>I love it. We should also consider a children's playground, something that blends with the nature of the hilltop.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. A treehouse or a slide could be a great addition. We should add some picnic tables and shaded areas so that families can come on their days off and have a nice picnic in the park.<p class=message>That's a great idea. It sounds like we have a lot of work ahead of us!<p class="message sent">Indeed we do, but I'm confident that we can make it work. With your architectural expertise and my horticultural knowledge, I think we can create a beautiful, natural-looking park that people will love.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c31ac852-4287-4b78-a949-220213412af2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
