How's business going today?<p class="message sent">Good morning to you too! It's going pretty well. How about yours?<p class=message>Yeah, not too bad. People seem to be really enjoying our local specialties.<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Nothing beats a traditional Singaporean breakfast of chicken rice and soy milk.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. I saw on your menu that you offer youtiao as well. That's one of my favorite breakfast items.<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a popular accompaniment to soy milk. A crunchy and savory contrast to the smoothness of the drink.<p class=message>Speaking of contrasts, do you also serve coffee? I know some people prefer it with their chicken rice.<p class="message sent">Not at this stall, unfortunately. But I've heard there's a great coffee shop just a few stores down.<p class=message>That's good to know. Maybe I'll check it out after my shift.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Speaking of shifts, do you have any secret recipe for your chicken rice?<p class=message>Well, I can't share all my secrets with you, but I will say that we use quality chicken and a masterful blend of spices.<p class="message sent">Ooh, now you're making my mouth water! I might have to try some for lunch later.<p class=message>You definitely should. And if you're still a bit hungry, we also have some delicious sides like braised tofu and vegetables.<p class="message sent">That's perfect! It's always great to have some healthy options to balance out the indulgence.<p class=message>Agreed. And now I'm getting hungry just talking about it. I think it's time for me to grab a quick bite before customers start pouring in.<p class="message sent">Same here. Nice chatting with you and have a great day!<p class=message>You too! Cheers to some satisfying breakfasts.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=195fa821-e9bd-41a4-b046-b47cc737c187.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
