We have a special request from a customer tonight.<p class="message sent">Of course, I've worked with blue crabs plenty of times. What does the customer want?<p class=message>They've requested our blue crab cakes, but they want it served with a side of spicy aioli. Can you make that happen?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, I'll add some extra kick to the aioli to really complement the flavors of the crab cakes.<p class=message>Sounds delicious.

Customers couldn't get enough of it.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear. It's really great working with such a talented chef like yourself.<p class="message sent">The feeling is mutual, manager A. And look at the view we have of the river.

That's why we always make sure to provide a seat by the window for those looking to enjoy the river view.<p class="message sent">It definitely adds to the dining experience. And speaking of customers, did you see the family of four that just walked in? They seem excited to try the seafood platter.<p class=message>Yes, I noticed them too. Let's make sure everything is perfect for them tonight. Our seafood platter is one of our most popular dishes.<p class="message sent">No problem, manager A. I'll make sure everything is cooked to perfection.<p class=message>That's what I like to hear. Thank you, chef B, for all your hard work. Our customers appreciate it, and so do I.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, manager A. It's always a pleasure working with you.
