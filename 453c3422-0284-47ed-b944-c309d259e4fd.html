(hands over documents)<p class=message>Thank you. Do you know why I pulled you over today?<p class="message sent">No, I have no idea. Did I run a red light or something?<p class=message>No, you were actually driving a bit over the speed limit. I am going to have to give you a ticket.<p class="message sent">Ah, that's a bummer. How much is it going to cost me?<p class=message>It will be $150, but if you pay it within 14 days, it will be reduced to $100.<p class="message sent">Okay, I guess that's not too bad. I will pay it on time.<p class=message>Great, just make sure to drive safely and watch your speed in the future.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. No more speeding for me.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that. And hey, at least the weather is nice today, isn't it?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's actually a perfect day for a drive. Not too hot, not too cold.<p class=message>Exactly. Are you from around here or just passing through?<p class="message sent">I'm from out of town, just visiting some family.<p class=message>Ah, I see. Well, I hope you enjoy your stay here in Adelaide.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I definitely will. It's a beautiful city.<p class=message>It certainly is. Have a safe drive and take care.<p class="message sent">Thank you officer, you too.
