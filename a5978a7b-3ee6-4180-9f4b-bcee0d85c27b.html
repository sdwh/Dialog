How about yours?<p class=message>Not bad. I'm actually excited for this trip to Nanjing.<p class="message sent">Oh, that's great! Is it your first time there?<p class=message>Yes, it is. I've heard so much about the city's history and culture.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Nanjing has so much to offer. Have you planned out what to do there?<p class=message>I have a few places in mind, like the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and the Zhonghua Gate.<p class="message sent">Ah, those are amazing choices. You'll definitely need a full day for each of them.<p class=message>Speaking of time, how long have you been a taxi driver?<p class="message sent">I've been driving for about 5 years now. It's a tough job, but it pays the bills.<p class=message>I can imagine. Do you have any funny or interesting stories from your time as a driver?<p class="message sent">One time, a drunk passenger got into the cab and started singing karaoke. It was quite the ride!<p class=message>(laughs) That sounds like a wild experience. Well, hopefully our ride to Nanjing won't be as eventful.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Yeah, let's hope so. Hey, have you tried any of the local food in Nanjing yet?<p class=message>Not yet, but I'm excited to try some traditional dishes like the Nanjing salted duck.<p class="message sent">Excellent choice! You'll definitely need to wash it down with some local beer or wine.<p class=message>Sounds like a great plan. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem. We're almost there, so get ready for an adventure in Nanjing!<p class=message>(smiling) I can't wait! Thanks for the ride and the great conversation.<p class="message sent">(smiling) My pleasure. Have a great trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a5956c33-55d0-489d-a3f7-d496c0dce20b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
