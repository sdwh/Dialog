How about you?<p class=message>Oh, I’ve been pretty busy with my new job, but it’s been fun.<p class="message sent">That’s great to hear! What did you order?<p class=message>I got the Caesar salad with grilled chicken. What about you?<p class="message sent">I got the veggie burger with sweet potato fries.<p class=message>Yum, that sounds good. How’s your burger?<p class="message sent">It’s delicious! The patty is made out of chickpeas and it’s so flavorful.<p class=message>That’s amazing. I might have to try that next time.<p class="message sent">Definitely!

Did she bring you any souvenirs?<p class=message>Yeah, she got me a cute little keychain with a hula dancer on it.<p class="message sent">That’s so sweet of her. I bet it’ll look great on your keys.<p class=message>Definitely. Well, it looks like we’re almost finished with our lunch.
