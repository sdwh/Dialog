I'm looking for some skincare products. Can you help me out?<p class="message sent">Of course, I'd be happy to assist you. What kind of products are you looking for?<p class=message>I need a new face wash, a facial mask, and a deodorant.<p class="message sent">Great, we've got a lot of options. Have you tried using a gel cleanser before? It's great for removing impurities without stripping your skin of its natural oils.<p class=message>No, but that sounds really interesting. Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Sure, one of my favorite gel cleansers is from this brand. It's infused with tea tree oil which is great for breakout-prone skin.<p class=message>That sounds perfect. I also want to try a new facial mask. What kind do you suggest?<p class="message sent">We have a lot of great options, but if you're looking for something quick and easy, a sheet mask might be your best bet. We have one that's incredibly moisturizing and has aloe vera in it.<p class=message>Sounds lovely. Lastly, I need a deodorant. I'm looking for something strong, but not overly scented or sticky.<p class="message sent">I totally understand. I recommend this brand of deodorant. It's got a neutral scent, is non-sticky, and helps control sweat and odor.<p class=message>Thanks so much for your help. I'll definitely try those products out.<p class="message sent">It was my pleasure. Do you have any other questions or concerns?<p class=message>No, that's it. You've been great.<p class="message sent">Thank you! Come back anytime if you need more assistance.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4af5affe-4770-4945-b555-721cafb91edc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
