I'm from the food inspection team. I'll be inspecting the food quality in your store today.<p class="message sent">Good morning! Of course, you're welcome to check anything you need.<p class=message>Thank you. First, can you show me your food storage area, please?<p class="message sent">Sure, it's right back here. We keep everything organized by expiration date.<p class=message>Great. I see that you have some fresh produce. Can you tell me where most of it comes from?<p class="message sent">Definitely. We work with a lot of local farmers to get the freshest produce possible.<p class=message>It's great to see that you support local farmers. Now, let's see your meat selection.<p class="message sent">Here it is. We have a variety of meats, and we always make sure to stock up on fresh cuts.<p class=message>I appreciate that. I'm just going to take a few samples for testing.<p class="message sent">No problem, go right ahead!<p class=message>Okay, I see that you also have a bakery section. What do you recommend?<p class="message sent">Our croissants are very popular, but we also have a variety of freshly baked bread.<p class=message>Mmm, those croissants do look delicious. I'll have to try one later. Now, can you show me your frozen food section?<p class="message sent">Right over here. We have a lot of frozen dinners, meat, fruits, and vegetables.<p class=message>Good to know. Lastly, can you tell me about the hygiene practices of your staff?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. All the staff is required to wear gloves and hairnets. We also sanitize all surfaces regularly.<p class=message>That's great to hear. It seems like your store has high-quality standards.<p class="message sent">Thank you! We try to provide the best for our customers.<p class=message>Well, thank you for your time, sir. I'll be sure to report positively.<p class="message sent">No problem, thank you for checking and have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=42a1455c-b254-4a4b-8d77-e96e0b95e5cb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
