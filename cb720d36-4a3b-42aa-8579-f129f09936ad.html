Are you excited to hit the waves?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I'm also a travel photographer, so I'm here to capture some amazing shots of surfers in action.<p class=message>Perfect, we have some great waves today. Let's get you suited up in a wetsuit and grab your board.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, I'm feeling a bit nervous though. Will I be able to catch any waves?<p class=message>Of course you will! We'll start with some basic techniques on the sand and work our way up to riding the waves.<p class="message sent">That's reassuring, thanks. How many people are in the lesson with us today?<p class=message>It's just you and a couple visiting from out of town. We like to keep our groups small so everyone gets personalized attention.<p class="message sent">That's awesome, I appreciate that. So, have you been surfing your whole life?<p class=message>Almost! I grew up on this coast and have been surfing since I was a kid. It's definitely my passion.<p class="message sent">I can tell, you're a great teacher. Alright, let's get out there and make some waves!<p class=message>Yeah, let's do it! And don't worry, I'm sure I'll catch you in some of my own photos while you're shredding.<p class="message sent">Haha, I hope so. I might just have to make a print of myself hanging ten and hang it up in my office.<p class=message>That would be epic! And if you ever want to come back and surf again, let me know. I have some secret spots I can take you to.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing, I'd definitely be down. Thanks again for an unforgettable experience.<p class=message>No problem, it was my pleasure. Now let's get you some more sweet shots!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cb719aa0-728c-41b6-b3ed-241037ffa1da.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
