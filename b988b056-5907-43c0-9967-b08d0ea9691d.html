Today we’re going to talk about the word “indifferent.” Have you heard of it before?<p class="message sent">Hi, yes I have, but I’m not entirely sure what it means.<p class=message>Well, “indifferent” is when someone is not interested or doesn’t care about something. For example, if your friend says he’s really into football, but you don’t care about it, you could say you’re indifferent to football.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. So it’s like being neutral or uninterested?<p class=message>Exactly! It’s like having a lack of enthusiasm or passion. But be careful, because sometimes it can also have a negative connotation if you’re indifferent to something important.<p class="message sent">Got it. Can you give me an example sentence using “indifferent”?<p class=message>Sure! How about this: “At the meeting, the boss seemed indifferent to our concerns about the new project.”<p class="message sent">Hmm, that’s not good. I’m guessing that means the boss didn’t care about their ideas?<p class=message>Yes, exactly. And in that context, it’s not a good thing. But on a lighter note, have you seen that new movie that came out?<p class="message sent">No, I haven’t. Is it any good?<p class=message>I thought it was great, but my friend was completely indifferent to it. She said it was just okay.<p class="message sent">Well, I guess that means I’ll have to see it for myself and form my own opinion.<p class=message>You got it! Remember, it’s okay to be indifferent sometimes, but try to stay enthusiastic and passionate about the things that matter most to you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b97d7fbe-076b-4311-998c-7d85cb24d804.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
