I'm a tourist and I'm looking for some help planning my itinerary in Osaka.<p class="message sent">Awesome! I'm here to help. What kind of activities are you interested in?<p class=message>I want to try some local food, visit historical landmarks, and maybe do some shopping.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! Did you know that Osaka is known for its street food, such as takoyaki and okonomiyaki?<p class=message>No, I didn't know that. Can you recommend some good places to try them?<p class="message sent">Of course! For takoyaki, you can check out the famous Kukuru or Aizuya. And for okonomiyaki, you should definitely visit Okonomiyaki Chitose.<p class=message>That sounds delicious. What about historical landmarks?<p class="message sent">Osaka Castle is a must-visit. It's a beautiful and historical building with a great view from the top. Also, the Shitennoji Temple is worth seeing.<p class=message>I've heard about those places. Thanks for reminding me. What about shopping?<p class="message sent">You can't leave Osaka without visiting the popular shopping districts of Shinsaibashi and Dotonbori. They offer a huge variety of shops, from big brands to small boutiques.<p class=message>Great! I'm excited to explore all of these places. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class="message sent">You should definitely try a river cruise along the Okawa River. It's a great way to see the city from a different perspective.<p class=message>That sounds like fun. Thanks for all your help!<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Enjoy your trip and have a great time in Osaka!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4f79bce5-e140-4bc6-a1a6-ab44a8756bbb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
