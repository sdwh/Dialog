There are so many options though, I don't know where to start!<p class=message>I hear you. I'm studying for the TOEIC Gold Level Certification right now. Have you heard of it?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have. How's it going?<p class=message>It's challenging, but I'm learning a lot. I'm thinking of branching out and getting a certification in IT too.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's a great idea. I've been looking into the CompTIA A+ certification, have you heard of it?<p class=message>Yeah, I have. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to get into IT.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a good place to start. But I'm also considering the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification.<p class=message>Wow, that's a pretty advanced certification. Do you have any experience in IT?<p class="message sent">A little, but I'm really interested in cybersecurity. I think it's such an important field.<p class=message>I totally agree. Cybersecurity is crucial in this day and age. But have you thought about the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) certification?<p class="message sent">Actually, no. What's that?<p class=message>It's a certification that covers auditing, control, and security of information systems. It's also highly respected in the IT industry.<p class="message sent">That sounds like a useful certification to have. I'll definitely look into it.<p class=message>Great! And once you get your certification, we should celebrate with some pizza and beer.<p class="message sent">Yes!
