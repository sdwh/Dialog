How are we all doing today?"<p class="message sent">"Great! I'm excited for today's lesson on idioms. I've always found them interesting."<p class=message>"That's great to hear, B. Speaking of idioms, have you ever heard of the phrase 'barking up the wrong tree'?"<p class="message sent">"Yes, I have. It means to pursue a misguided or wrong course of action, right?"<p class=message>"Exactly. It originated from the practice of hunting dogs barking at the base of the tree instead of the actual prey that was hiding up above. It's always fascinating to know the origins of these phrases."<p class="message sent">"That's really interesting. I'll be sure to remember that."<p class=message>"Here's another one for you, B. What do you think the expression 'back to square one' means?"<p class="message sent">"Hmm, I'm not quite sure. Does it mean to start over from the beginning?"<p class=message>"Correct! It's often used when something doesn't go as planned and you have to start again from the beginning. How about you share an idiom that you know?"<p class="message sent">"How about 'the ball is in your court?' I think it means that it's up to someone to take action and make the next move."<p class=message>"Very good, B. It can mean that you're waiting for someone else to make a move before you can proceed. Well done!"<p class="message sent">"Thanks, Teacher A. I'm really enjoying today's lesson. Learning idioms is quite fun."<p class=message>"I'm glad to hear that, B. It's important to have fun while learning. That's the beauty of language and linguistics."<p class="message sent">"Yes, I couldn't agree more. I can't wait to use these idioms in my conversations with friends and family."<p class=message>"Excellent! Remember, practice makes perfect. Keep using these idioms and you'll soon become a master at them."<p class="message sent">"Thanks, Teacher A. I will definitely do that."<p class=message>"Okay class, that's all for today. See you all next time with more interesting idioms to learn."</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=435e7dfc-679d-4c80-b5bc-5e994de2a44d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
