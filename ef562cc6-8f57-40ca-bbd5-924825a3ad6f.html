Why do you ask?<p class=message>Well, I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Do you know how it differs from regular security breaches?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. ISO 27001 is an international standard that outlines the best practices for managing information security incidents. This means that companies can follow a set of guidelines that have been agreed upon globally.<p class=message>That makes sense. Can you give me an example of a security incident that would fall under this standard?<p class="message sent">Sure. Let's say someone hacks into your company's server and steals sensitive data. That would definitely qualify as a security incident.<p class=message>Ah, I see. So, what do companies need to do in order to comply with this standard?<p class="message sent">Well, first they need to identify any potential risks and implement measures to prevent them. Then, they need to have a plan in place in case an incident does occur. This includes establishing reporting procedures and ensuring that all employees are trained to handle security incidents.<p class=message>Wow, it sounds like a lot of work. Have you ever been involved in responding to a security incident?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It can be a stressful experience, but if you have a good plan in place, it makes things a lot easier.<p class=message>That's good to know. Do you think all companies should be required to follow the standard?<p class="message sent">I do. Information security is becoming increasingly important in today's digital age, and companies need to take it seriously in order to protect their customers and their reputation.<p class=message>Absolutely. Thanks for explaining all of this to me, B. You always make things so clear.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. And remember, when it comes to information security, it's better to be safe than sorry.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ef5620c9-fa38-491c-ad37-5bc1dd31c2a2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
