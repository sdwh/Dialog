Have you played it before?<p class=message>No, this is my first time. What about you?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've played it a few times. It's really fun and not too complicated.<p class=message>That's good to hear. I'm not the best at these strategic games.<p class="message sent">Well, it's all about luck too.

But it's a classic for a reason.<p class=message>Fair enough. Well, my favorite is Scrabble. I love word games.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. I can appreciate that.
