How's your day going?<p class="message sent">It's going pretty well, A. How about you?<p class=message>Can't complain, just been busy with some source code analysis. Found some interesting vulnerabilities in our system.<p class="message sent">Oh boy, that's not good. What kind of vulnerabilities are we talking about?<p class=message>Well, some simple SQL injections and some Cross-Site Scripting attacks. Nothing too major, but it still needs to be addressed.<p class="message sent">Yeah, definitely. So, what's the plan? How are we going to fix these problems?<p class=message>We'll need to implement some input validation and sanitization measures and make sure we're utilizing prepared statements for all database queries.<p class="message sent">Got it. I'll start working on that right away. Anything else we need to do?<p class=message>Just make sure we're using the latest version of our programming language and any third-party libraries to ensure we have the most current security patches.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Thanks for bringing these issues to my attention, A.<p class=message>No problem, that's what I'm here for. And hey, at least we caught these vulnerabilities before any real damage was done.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I guess you're right. It's better to be proactive than reactive when it comes to security, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. That's what we're paid for, after all. And hey, once we're done with this, maybe we can grab a beer and celebrate our victory?<p class="message sent">Ha, I like the way you think, A. Let's definitely do that.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ddc4c87a-bcb5-403b-a0e0-0b4f139adb39.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
