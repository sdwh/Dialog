I'm a back-end engineer in charge of designing our company's employee database system. Nice to work with you, B.<p class="message sent">Hi there, A. It's nice to meet you too. As a database administrator, I'm excited to get started on this project with you. What's the outline of your plan for this system?<p class=message>Well, I was thinking we could start with a master table of employees which can store essential details like their name, ID, department, and job title.<p class="message sent">That's a good start. We could also create separate tables that store information on employee absences, leaves, and benefits. And we should ensure that we follow industry standards to secure the employee data.<p class=message>Right, security should be a top priority as we'll be handling sensitive information. We should also ensure that any updates to the data are done through the system and not manually.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Given the size of our organization, we'll need to make sure that the system can handle large amounts of data and that queries run smoothly. And we must make sure to backup the data regularly.<p class=message>Yes, and we must take into consideration the possibility of various access levels to the data, so that different departments and management levels can check it.<p class="message sent">That's great, A. Another thing to consider is how to ensure employee confidentiality while still allowing access to essential data. And we should ensure that the database system is user-friendly for our HR colleagues.<p class=message>For sure. That's a consideration that cannot be ignored. Integration across all HR functions would be necessary too. We have to make sure that all HR and payroll functions are in one system.<p class="message sent">You're absolutely right. With all of these elements in mind, this system would be a valuable asset to our company in handling confidential employee data. Thank you, A. Let's get started on this project.<p class=message>Great, thank you, B. This conversation gave me some fresh perspectives, so I'm excited to work on it with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=90794ce2-90ac-4629-988e-09ff349e9d59.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
