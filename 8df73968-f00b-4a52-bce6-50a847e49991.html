We have to consider factors such as security, user-friendliness and scalability while designing the application.<p class=message>Definitely. We need to ensure that the application is compatible with multiple platforms like iOS, Android and web browsers.<p class="message sent">We should also take into account the different languages our customers speak and make sure the app is accessible to everyone.<p class=message>That's a great point, B. We should aim for a seamless booking experience with minimal steps involved.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we could add features like seat selection and meal preferences to the booking process. This will increase convenience for our customers.<p class=message>Absolutely. Another important aspect is integrating payment gateways to make payments more secure and efficient.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we should also focus on integrating database management systems to ensure data such as customer information, flight schedules and seat availability are maintained accurately.<p class=message>Do you think we should incorporate a feature for booking extras like extra baggage or lounge access?<p class="message sent">Definitely, that would be a great addition. We could also add features for tracking the flight status and providing real-time updates to the passengers.<p class=message>It seems like we have a lot of work to do but I think we can come up with something great.<p class="message sent">Agreed. With our combined skills and expertise, we can design an amazing application which will revolutionize the airline industry.<p class=message>That's the spirit!
