What can I help you with today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I was out driving and saw your store. I thought I'd stop by and check out some of the local specialties.<p class=message>Great! We have a wide variety of goods from the area. Our smoked salmon and pickled vegetables are particularly popular.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds delicious! I love trying different foods when I'm traveling. Can you recommend anything else?<p class=message>Definitely try some of our Hokkaido milk cookies. They're made with fresh milk from local farms and have a melt-in-your-mouth texture.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a treat! I'll take a box of those, please. And what about souvenirs? Anything unique to this town?<p class=message>We have these handcrafted wooden bears that are made by a local artisan. They're cute and a great keepsake of your trip to Hokkaido.<p class="message sent">Wow, those are adorable! I'll take one of those as well. I'm glad I stopped by your store.<p class=message>We're happy to have you! Do you have any other plans while you're in town?<p class="message sent">Actually, I'm thinking of heading out to see the snow monkeys. Have you been?<p class=message>Yes, I have! It's definitely a highlight of the area. Just make sure to dress warmly - those monkeys can handle the cold better than we can!<p class="message sent">Good tip, thanks! I've heard they're pretty social and like to get close to people.<p class=message>That's true! They're quite curious and aren't shy around humans. Just remember to keep a safe distance and don't feed them.<p class="message sent">Got it. Thanks for all the advice! I'll definitely tell my friends about your store if they're ever in the area.<p class=message>We'd appreciate that! And enjoy the rest of your trip. Hokkaido has so much to offer.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4cf9808d-d6e7-456a-ac0f-ecd3af13f21c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
