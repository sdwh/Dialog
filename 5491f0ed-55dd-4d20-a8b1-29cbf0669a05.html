Do you think our company should adopt those standards?<p class=message>Well, it depends on our company's needs and resources.<p class="message sent">That makes sense. Can you tell me more about ISO 27001?<p class=message>Sure, it's more focused on the management system for information security.<p class="message sent">And what about ISO 27002?<p class=message>ISO 27002 is more focused on the actual controls that companies can implement to ensure information security.<p class="message sent">That's interesting. Do you know any examples of those controls?<p class=message>Some examples are access control, network security, and incident management.<p class="message sent">Got it. Have you ever seen a company adopt these standards before?<p class=message>Yes, some big companies like Google and Microsoft have implemented them.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's impressive. So, what do you think are the benefits of adopting these standards?<p class=message>Well, it can help us identify and manage risks better, and it can also increase our customers' confidence in our information security practices.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a good idea. But do you think it would take a lot of time and effort to adopt these standards?<p class=message>Yes, it will definitely take some time and resources to implement them properly.<p class="message sent">Okay, thanks for the information. I think we should look into adopting these standards to make our company more secure.<p class=message>I agree. It's always better to be safe than sorry.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=548efae5-690c-44f5-8c5c-a90fa68715bf.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
