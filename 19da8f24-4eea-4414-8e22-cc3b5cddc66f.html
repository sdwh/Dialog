How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hi A! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well too. I'm excited to talk to you about learning .NET Framework. Have you ever worked with it before?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. I'm actually quite new to programming in general.<p class=message>No worries, we all have to start somewhere. I highly recommend starting with some basic C# programming tutorials to get a good foundation before diving into .NET.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the tip. Do you have any favorite resources for learning C#?<p class=message>Definitely check out Codecademy and Pluralsight. They have some great interactive courses that will help you get up to speed quickly.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. Once I get the basics down, where should I go to learn more about .NET Framework specifically?<p class=message>In my experience, Microsoft's official documentation is a great place to start. It's well organized and very thorough. Plus, there are always helpful forums where you can ask questions and get advice from other developers.<p class="message sent">That's good to know. How long do you think it will take me to feel comfortable working with .NET?<p class=message>It really depends on how much time and effort you're willing to put in. But if you stay dedicated and keep practicing, I think you could start feeling confident within a few months.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's not too bad. Thanks for all the advice, A. I'm looking forward to getting started.<p class=message>Absolutely! And remember, the most important thing is to have fun and keep learning. Good luck!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=19d007d8-a19d-450a-be34-ef1cb0353775.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
