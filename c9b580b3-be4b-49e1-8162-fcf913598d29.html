How are you finding the restaurant so far?<p class="message sent">Hey there, mate. I'm doing well, thanks. And you?<p class=message>I'm great, thank you for asking. I noticed that you're the chef for tonight. What's the specialty for today?<p class="message sent">Well, we have a traditional Aussie dish on the menu tonight - Kangaroo steak. It's marinated with native spices and served with sweet potato mash.<p class=message>That sounds absolutely delicious! Have you tried it yourself?<p class="message sent">Of course! As the chef, I have to make sure everything is spot on before it comes out of the kitchen.<p class=message>That's fantastic to hear. So, what other Australian treats would you recommend for a tourist visiting Sydney for the first time?<p class="message sent">Well, we have the classic meat pies, which every Aussie loves. And of course, you have to try the Pavlova - a meringue dessert with fresh fruits.<p class=message>Fantastic! I can't wait to have a taste of those too. And what about the drinks? Any recommendations?<p class="message sent">You can't go wrong with a cold beer or some Australian wine. We have a great selection of both.<p class=message>That's great to know. Thank you for your recommendations. I'm excited to try them all.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. Just let me know what you feel like and I'll make sure it's prepared to perfection.<p class=message>Thank you, B. That's very kind of you. I hope the night goes smoothly for both of us.<p class="message sent">Don't worry, we'll make sure everything is perfect for the customers. It's what we do. Enjoy your meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c9b2ccce-e91c-4613-aeae-69d3894503ce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
