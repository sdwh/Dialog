I'm here to conduct the ISO 27001 audit.<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm doing well, thanks for asking. It's great to have you here to help us ensure we're meeting the standard.<p class=message>Absolutely, happy to be of assistance. So, do you have any questions about the audit process?<p class="message sent">Well, I was wondering, what kind of things will you be looking for specifically during the audit?<p class=message>Good question. I'll be examining your physical security measures, access controls, security policies and procedures, risk management protocols, and your incident response plan.<p class="message sent">Sounds pretty thorough. I'm confident we've got everything in order, but we'll be sure to fill you in on any areas that need improvement.<p class=message>Excellent. It's always better to be proactive rather than reactive. On a lighter note, have you seen the latest Star Wars movie yet?<p class="message sent">I have! I thought it was great. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. I loved the nostalgic references to the previous films. Have you seen the Mandalorian TV series?<p class="message sent">Yes, and it's my favorite show on Disney+. Baby Yoda is just too cute!<p class=message>I know, right? It's always nice to take a break from work and enjoy some entertainment. Speaking of breaks, do you have any good lunch recommendations around here?<p class="message sent">Definitely, there's a cozy sandwich shop just a couple of blocks away that I always go to. I can show you the way.<p class=message>That sounds perfect, thanks. And while we're at it, do you know any good dessert spots?<p class="message sent">Hmm, let me think. There's a great ice cream parlor down the street that I'm sure you'll love.<p class=message>You read my mind, I'm a sucker for ice cream. Thanks again B, this has been a great conversation.<p class="message sent">Absolutely, and good luck with the rest of the audit process.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7df1a9aa-427d-4f53-a298-0dee4d249326.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
