How are you today?<p class="message sent">I'm great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. Can I interest you in some authentic Australian cuisine?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Our menu features kangaroo and emu meat, both of which are staples in the Australian diet.<p class=message>Our kangaroo meat is served with a side of roasted vegetables and a homemade wine reduction sauce. Would you like to try it?<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. And what about the emu meat?<p class=message>The emu meat is prepared as a steak and served with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. It's a hearty meal that's sure to satisfy.<p class="message sent">I might have to try both dishes! Speaking of Australian cuisine, have you ever tried Vegemite?<p class=message>I have indeed!

I think it's an acquired taste as well, but it's definitely a unique flavor.<p class=message>Absolutely.
