You must be the new student I'm going to teach today. How are you feeling?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, that's me. I'm excited and a bit nervous at the same time. I've never tried surfing before.<p class=message>No worries, mate. Surfing is all about balance and timing. I'll teach you the basics and we'll take it from there.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. What's the first thing I need to know?<p class=message>Well, the most important thing is to be aware of the waves. Listen to the directions I give you and watch the patterns of the water.<p class="message sent">Got it. Should I be worried about sharks or anything like that?<p class=message>Haha, don't worry. We're in a safe area and there are rarely any sharks around here. But if you do see one, just go to the shore calmly.<p class="message sent">Okay, thanks for letting me know. How long will it take me to stand up on the board?<p class=message>It depends on the person, but usually it takes a few attempts before you can stand up properly. Don't worry about falling off the board though, it's all part of the fun.<p class="message sent">I see. Do you think I can do it?<p class=message>Absolutely! Surfing is not just a sport, it's a lifestyle. Once you get hooked, you'll never want to stop.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! I can't wait to try it out.<p class=message>Alright, let's go! First, we need to practice paddling and popping up. Lie down on the board and paddle with your hands.<p class="message sent">Like this?<p class=message>Yes, and when I say "pop up", push up with your hands and bring your feet under you. Try it now.<p class="message sent">(tries to pop up) Oops, I fell.<p class=message>That's okay. Try again. You're getting closer!<p class="message sent">(tries again and successfully pops up) Hey, I did it!<p class=message>Great job, mate! You're a natural. Now, let's catch some waves!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=44350c76-904e-4863-b844-b52e5af2166e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
