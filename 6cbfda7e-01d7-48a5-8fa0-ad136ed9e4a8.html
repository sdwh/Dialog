What do you have in store for us?<p class=message>We're going to focus on weight training today, targeting your legs and core muscles.<p class="message sent">Sounds intense, but I'm up for the challenge. Let's do this!<p class=message>Alright, first up, squats. Make sure to keep your knees behind your toes and engage your glutes.<p class="message sent">Got it, how many reps should I do?<p class=message>Let's start with 10 reps and 3 sets. Keep your form tight.<p class="message sent">(panting) That was tough, what's next?<p class=message>Deadlifts. Remember to hinge at your hips and engage your back muscles to prevent injury.<p class="message sent">Can we take a quick water break before we continue?<p class=message>Sure, hydration is important. But let's not take too long, we don't want our muscles to cool down.<p class="message sent">Alright, I'm ready for the next exercise. What's our next target?<p class=message>Lunges. This one's great for your quadriceps and hamstrings. Start with your left leg and step forward, lowering your body until your right knee touches the ground.<p class="message sent">(grunting) This is harder than it looks!<p class=message>Great job so far. Let's finish up with some core exercises - planks and Russian twists.<p class="message sent">(groaning) I don't know if I have any core left!<p class=message>Don't give up yet, we're almost done. Remember to breathe and engage your abdominal muscles.<p class="message sent">(breathing heavily) How much longer do we have?<p class=message>Just a few more sets. You're doing great, keep it up!<p class="message sent">(exhaling) Ok, I think I can do this. Thanks for pushing me, coach.<p class=message>No problem, that's what I'm here for. You've got this!<p class="message sent">(smiling) I feel so accomplished. Can't wait for our next training session.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6cbf073b-d6f9-4974-b64a-2fcb0b9ee5f5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
