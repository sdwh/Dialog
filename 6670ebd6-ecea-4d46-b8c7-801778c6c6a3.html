Yes, we do have a squash court. Would you like to use it?<p class=message>That's great! Yes, I'd like to use it. How can I do that?<p class="message sent">You can either reserve a time at the front desk or you can use our online booking system.<p class=message>Ok, thanks! How much does it cost to use the court?<p class="message sent">It's free of charge for hotel guests. We also provide rackets and balls for your convenience.<p class=message>Awesome! Do you have any tips for playing squash?<p class="message sent">Sure, the key is to stay focused and keep moving. The game can be quite intense, so it's important to stay hydrated too.<p class=message>That's really helpful, thanks. How long can we use the court for?<p class="message sent">You can use it for up to an hour at a time, but you can book it for longer if no one else has reserved it after you.<p class=message>Great, I'll keep that in mind. By the way, is there a dress code for the court?<p class="message sent">Not really, but we do recommend wearing appropriate footwear and comfortable clothing.<p class=message>Sounds good. Do you have any other facilities for sports in the hotel?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a gym, a swimming pool, and a tennis court as well. You're welcome to use any of them if you'd like.<p class=message>Wow, that's impressive. Thank you for your help!<p class="message sent">You're welcome!
