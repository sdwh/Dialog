How's it going?<p class="message sent">Good, thanks for asking. I'm just a little nervous about this ISO 27001 audit.<p class=message>Don't worry about it too much. We'll get through it together. So, let's start with the database management procedures. Have you ensured that all the access controls are in place?<p class="message sent">Yes, all the permissions and user roles have been set up properly. And the database is regularly backed up.<p class=message>Great. That's one less thing to worry about. How about physical security? Are the servers kept in a secure area?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. The servers are kept in a locked room, and only authorized personnel are allowed access.<p class=message>Excellent. Now, let's move on to data transmission security. Can you tell me about the measures you've taken to protect data in transit?<p class="message sent">Sure. We use secure protocols like SSL and TLS for all data transmission. And data encryption is applied throughout.<p class=message>That sounds very secure. And how about data retention and disposal? Are there any secure procedures in place?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have a strict retention policy and data is disposed of securely using specialized software.<p class=message>Well done, B. It seems like you've covered all the bases. I'm very impressed with your attention to detail.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. Your guidance and suggestions have been helpful during this process.<p class=message>No problem, B. We can schedule a follow-up meeting in a few weeks to ensure that everything is still in compliance. But for now, let's take a break and grab some lunch.<p class="message sent">That sounds good to me. I could use a break from all this ISO talk!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=876a518a-eef3-4791-8334-b54940c2d5ce.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
