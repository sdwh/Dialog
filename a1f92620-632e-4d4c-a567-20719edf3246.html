I heard you're a game developer. What kind of games have you made before?<p class="message sent">Hello! Yes, I am a game developer. I've made a few puzzle games before. They were quite challenging, but also entertaining.<p class=message>That's great! I really enjoy playing puzzle games. What inspired you to create them?<p class="message sent">Well, I love solving puzzles myself, so I thought it would be interesting to create games that challenge players' thinking and problem-solving skills.<p class=message>I totally get it. I also spend a lot of time playing games that test my brainpower. Hey, do you have any new puzzle games in the works?<p class="message sent">As a matter of fact, I do! I'm currently working on a new puzzle game that involves solving mysteries within a specific time limit.<p class=message>That sounds exciting! Can you give me a little hint about the type of mysteries players will need to solve?<p class="message sent">Sure, it will require players to use logic, deduction, and critical thinking to uncover clues and secrets.<p class=message>Wow, this game sounds challenging. I can't wait to try it out! Will there be any special features in the new game?<p class="message sent">Yes, there will be a few new features, such as an interactive map and a puzzle hint system. I think players will really enjoy them.<p class=message>Awesome! I'm sure players will appreciate those extra features. When will the game be released?<p class="message sent">It's still in development, but we're aiming to release it before the end of the year.<p class=message>That's great news! I'll definitely be on the lookout for it. Thanks for telling me about your new game.<p class="message sent">My pleasure! I can't wait to see what players think of it.
