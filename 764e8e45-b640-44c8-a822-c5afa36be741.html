I'm Captain Smith, and I'll be flying the plane today. Have you completed your security check?<p class="message sent">Hi, Captain. Yes, I have. I've taken off my shoes, emptied my pockets, and put my liquids in a clear bag.<p class=message>Excellent, sir. Now, could you please show me your ID and boarding pass?<p class="message sent">Sure, here you go.<p class=message>Thank you. Before we board, I'd like to remind you that all electronic devices must be turned off and stowed during takeoff and landing.<p class="message sent">I know, Captain. However, may I ask why we need to turn off electronic devices?<p class=message>That's a great question, sir. The reason is that electronic devices can interfere with the plane's communication and navigation systems. It's better to be safe than sorry.<p class="message sent">I see. Thank you for explaining that, Captain.<p class=message>You're very welcome. Also, please make sure your seat belt is securely fastened at all times during the flight. If you need any assistance, please don't hesitate to let us know.<p class="message sent">I will, thank you. By the way, how long is the flight today, Captain?<p class=message>Our estimated flight time is around four hours. We'll be flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet and the weather is looking good, so we should have a smooth ride.<p class="message sent">Sounds great. I'm looking forward to it. Thank you for your help, Captain.<p class=message>No problem, sir. We're here to ensure your safety and comfort. Please enjoy your flight with us today.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=764b0abd-099e-4244-a826-a5901fa75d62.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
