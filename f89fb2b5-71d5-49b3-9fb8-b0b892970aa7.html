Nice to meet you. Can you tell me about your previous experience in housekeeping?<p class=message>Sure, I worked at a hotel for 2 years as a housekeeper, so I have experience with bed-making, room cleaning, and laundry.<p class="message sent">Great! Can you also tell me how you manage your time efficiently to finish your tasks?<p class=message>Yes, I prioritize my tasks based on urgency and importance, and I always make sure to finish them within the allotted time.<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect. In this position, you'll be required to work early mornings and some weekends. Is that something you're comfortable with?<p class=message>Yes, I'm a morning person and weekends are actually easier for me since I don't have any other commitments.<p class="message sent">Good to know. Can you also handle physically demanding tasks like lifting and pushing heavy carts?<p class=message>Yes, I'm capable of that. I stay fit and lift weights regularly, so that won't be a problem.<p class="message sent">Impressive! Lastly, can you tell me about a time when you resolved a customer complaint?<p class=message>I remember a time when a guest complained about a stain on their bed sheet. I apologized and immediately replaced the sheet with a clean one. I also offered a discount for their inconvenience.<p class="message sent">Excellent customer service skills. Based on your experience and answers, I think you're very qualified for the position. We'll be in touch soon.<p class=message>Thank you so much, Lisa. I'm really excited about this opportunity and look forward to hearing back from you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f89cdc22-24dd-47f4-ab22-b8fe9c1604bb.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
