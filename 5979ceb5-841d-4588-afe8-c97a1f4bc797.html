I'm so excited to be on set again for this new film.<p class=message>I'm glad to hear that! We're lucky to have such a talented actor like you on board for our project.<p class="message sent">Thank you, that means a lot to me. So, what scene are we shooting today?<p class=message>We're actually going to film a scene where you have to jump off a moving train.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds exciting! Have you done that before?<p class=message>(laughs) Not in real life, but I'm hoping my imagination will do the trick.<p class="message sent">I'm sure it will! So, what inspired you to become a filmmaker?<p class=message>I've always been fascinated with storytelling, and film is such a powerful medium to convey emotions and move people.<p class="message sent">That's so true. I think as actors, we have that same goal in mind - to evoke emotions in our audience through our performances.<p class=message>Absolutely! And speaking of performances, how do you usually prepare for a role like this?<p class="message sent">Well, I usually start by researching the character's background and motivation, and then I try to find similarities between myself and that character.<p class=message>That's a great approach. And what do you do to get into character on set?<p class="message sent">I usually try to take a moment to breathe and get into the right mindset, and then I just focus on the scene and what my character wants in that moment.<p class=message>That makes sense. And what about off set? What do you like to do in your free time?<p class="message sent">I love to read and watch movies, of course. And I also enjoy hiking and exploring new places.<p class=message>That sounds like a great way to recharge. And speaking of exploring, have you had a chance to check out Melbourne yet?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I actually went to a street festival over the weekend and had some amazing food and met some really cool people.<p class=message>That's awesome! I love this city - it has so much character and energy. And speaking of energy, are you ready to jump off that train yet?<p class="message sent">(laughs) I was born ready! Let's do this.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=5971ab17-df68-4245-a03d-0dedd99c69d2.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
