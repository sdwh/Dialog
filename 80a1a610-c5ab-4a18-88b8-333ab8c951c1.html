I'm a reporter for the Daily News. Can I ask you a few questions?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! What do you need to know?<p class=message>Well, first off, what brings you to this event today?<p class="message sent">Oh, I'm just here for the free food, to be honest. (laughs)<p class=message>(laughs) Can't say I blame you there. What's been your favorite dish so far?<p class="message sent">Definitely the pulled pork sliders. I could eat a whole tray of them!<p class=message>Sounds delicious! So, are you attending this event alone or with a group?<p class="message sent">I'm here with some friends. We're having a great time checking out all the booths and trying all the different samples.<p class=message>That sounds like a blast! Have you discovered any new products you're particularly excited about?<p class="message sent">Yes, actually! There's a company over there that makes delicious, all-natural snack bars. I'm definitely going to stock up on those for my afternoon snack.<p class=message>Nice find! So, what do you do for a living when you're not enjoying food festivals?<p class="message sent">I work in marketing for a tech company. It's pretty fast-paced, but I love it. How about you? What do you do?<p class=message>I'm a reporter, so I'm always on the lookout for a good story. I love meeting new people and learning about their experiences.<p class="message sent">That sounds fascinating! Do you have any good stories you're working on right now?<p class=message>Actually, yes! I'm doing an investigation into some local businesses that may be engaging in illegal activity. It's been a tough one to crack, but I'm optimistic.<p class="message sent">Wow, that does sound like a big project. Good luck with that!<p class=message>Thanks! Well, I think I've got enough information for my story. Thanks so much for chatting with me!<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. Enjoy the rest of the event!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=809f6157-dbaf-4abb-bf56-4272a75aa0a8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
