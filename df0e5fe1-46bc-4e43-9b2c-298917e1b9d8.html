Do you think it's practical for companies to implement?<p class="message sent">Well, I think it depends on the size of the company and the level of risk they face.<p class=message>That's a great point. But do you think it's worth it for smaller companies to invest in it?<p class="message sent">Definitely, because malware attacks can be devastating for any company, regardless of its size.<p class=message>True. So, do you know what measures the standard recommends for preventing malware attacks?<p class="message sent">I think it includes regular virus scans, firewalls, and employee training to avoid phishing emails and malicious downloads.<p class=message>You're right. And how about after an attack occurs? Do you know what the standard recommends for recovery?<p class="message sent">I think it involves isolating the infected systems, identifying the source of the infection, and eliminating it before restoring affected systems.<p class=message>That's correct. I heard that a lot of companies have implemented the standard and seen positive results.<p class="message sent">Yes, it seems to have become a best practice for cybersecurity. Have you ever experienced a malware attack before?<p class=message>Thankfully not, but I've heard horror stories of companies being held ransom by cybercriminals demanding payment to release their data.<p class="message sent">Scary stuff. That's why it's important to always be vigilant and take preventive measures.<p class=message>Absolutely. Do you have any other tips or recommendations for protecting against malware?<p class="message sent">A good backup strategy is key, so in case of an attack, you can quickly restore your systems without losing data. And always keep your software up-to-date with the latest security patches.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. It's always great to learn more about cybersecurity!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=df089c39-b107-4369-b698-81b5a2fe328a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
