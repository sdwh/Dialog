How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hi, A! I'm doing great. We've got some delicious new flavors of dumplings and noodles to try out today. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. I've been experimenting with a spicy Sichuan-style filling for our dumplings. Can't wait to see how it turns out.<p class="message sent">Sounds amazing! I've also been working on a new lamb broth for our noodles. It's got a rich, savory flavor that I think our customers will love.<p class=message>Oh, I haven't tried that one yet. Maybe you could give me a bowl later?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! How about we trade? I'll give you a bowl of my lamb noodles if you show me how you make your dumplings.<p class=message>Deal! Although I have to warn you, my dumpling-folding skills are not the best.<p class="message sent">That's okay. We'll work on it together. By the end of the day, you'll be a pro!<p class=message>(laughs) Thanks, B. I appreciate the encouragement. So, have we had any interesting customers lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, we had a group of tourists from Italy come in last week. They were amazed by the flavor and texture of our dumplings.<p class=message>That's awesome! It's always rewarding to see people enjoy our food.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And we've also been getting some positive reviews online. Our restaurant is really gaining some traction these days.<p class=message>I'm so glad to hear that. It makes all the hard work worth it.<p class="message sent">Speaking of hard work, we've got a busy day ahead of us. Are you ready to start cooking?<p class=message>Ready as I'll ever be! Let's get to it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=cb1c2ea4-9170-4e5b-9889-fdb3ee10d06b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
