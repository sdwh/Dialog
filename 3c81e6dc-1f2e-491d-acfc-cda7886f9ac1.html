It's great to see you all here today.<p class="message sent">Good morning Pastor A, thank you for having us today.<p class=message>Of course, it's always a pleasure to have you all here. How have you been this week, B?<p class="message sent">I've been doing well, thanks for asking. How about you, Pastor?<p class=message>I'm doing well too, thank you. So, today we're going to talk about forgiveness.<p class="message sent">That's a timely topic given everything going on in the world right now.<p class=message>Yes, I agree. It's so important to be able to forgive and let go of any anger or resentment we may hold onto.<p class="message sent">It's certainly easier said than done, isn't it, Pastor?<p class=message>Absolutely, but with the grace of God, all things are possible. And forgiveness can be such a liberating experience.<p class="message sent">Speaking of liberating experiences, have you ever gone skydiving, Pastor?<p class=message>(chuckles) No, I haven't. Why do you ask?<p class="message sent">Well, I went skydiving last summer and it was the most incredible experience ever. I felt so free and alive.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! I'll have to add it to my bucket list.<p class="message sent">You definitely should! Maybe we can plan a church trip someday.<p class=message>That would be quite a memorable adventure. But for now, let's focus on our forgiveness journey and how we can extend grace to others.<p class="message sent">Amen to that, Pastor. Thank you for your wise words as always.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3c812fc0-c24e-4e1a-b712-6e4e8a80ec35.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
