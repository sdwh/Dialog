How's the audit going so far?<p class="message sent">Good morning! It's going well, just going through some of the network security controls now.<p class=message>Great to hear! Are there any areas that you're particularly excited to audit?<p class="message sent">Yes, I always find it interesting to check the firewalls and see how effective they are in preventing unauthorized access.<p class=message>Oh, that's definitely a crucial aspect for information security. Speaking of firewalls, have you heard about that meme that's been going around about 'asking your firewall'?<p class="message sent">(Laughs) No, I haven't! What's that all about?<p class=message>It's a play on words, you see. Instead of asking someone who is knowledgeable, people are posting ridiculous questions online, and then responding with "sorry, I asked my firewall." It's quite silly but I can't help but chuckle.<p class="message sent">Haha, that's hilarious! I'll have to check it out later.<p class=message>Glad I could brighten up your day. So, back to the audit, anything else you think we should prioritize?<p class="message sent">Definitely the employee training programs. We need to ensure that everyone understands their role in maintaining information security.<p class=message>Agreed. And you know what they say - human error is the biggest threat to security.<p class="message sent">That's right, so we need to make sure everyone knows how to handle sensitive information properly.<p class=message>Exactly. Well, let's get back to it. Thank you for your hard work so far.<p class="message sent">No problem, happy to help. And thanks for the meme-induced laughter!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=312b505a-0191-4760-a5c5-4f5daeb37dbc.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
