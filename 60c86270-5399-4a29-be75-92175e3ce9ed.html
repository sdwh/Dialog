Have you had a chance to look at the new schema for the e-commerce system we are developing?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm good, thanks. Yes, I have taken a look at it. It looks quite interesting, but I have a few questions about the data design.<p class=message>Sure thing. What's on your mind?<p class="message sent">I noticed that you used several one-to-many relationships in the design. Can you explain why you chose to do that?<p class=message>Good question. We wanted to make sure that the data was normalized and that each piece of information was stored in the most appropriate table. Plus, this makes it easier to search and filter data.<p class="message sent">Ah, I see. That makes sense. What about the indexing? Did you add any indexes to speed up queries?<p class=message>Yes, we did. We added indexes to the columns that are used most frequently in queries. This should improve the performance of the system.<p class="message sent">Nice work, A. I also noticed that you added some computed columns. What was the reasoning behind that?<p class=message>We added those columns to simplify certain calculations and make the data more useful. This will save us time and make the system more user-friendly.<p class="message sent">Great job, A. You put a lot of thought into this design. I can't wait to start working with the data.<p class=message>Thank you, B. I'm excited to see how the system will perform once it's up and running.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. Let's get to work and make this project a success!<p class=message>Agreed, B. Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=60c43899-1b9e-4cc5-a1de-e20ec2a128f0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
