I heard you're interested in learning Vue.js. Is that right?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's correct. I've heard it's a great tool for creating interactive web applications.<p class=message>That's absolutely true! Vue.js is an excellent framework for building dynamic and responsive web interfaces. The first step is to get familiar with the basics.<p class="message sent">Okay, that sounds good. What resources do you recommend for getting started?<p class=message>Well, there are plenty of online tutorials, documentation, and video courses available.
