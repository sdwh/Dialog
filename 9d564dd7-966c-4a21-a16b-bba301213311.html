How's it going?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! I'm good, thanks for asking. So, how's the writing going?<p class=message>It's going well, I'm almost finished with my latest book. I wanted to talk to you about the publishing plan.<p class="message sent">Sure, let's hear it.<p class=message>Well, I was thinking of releasing it in the fall, maybe around October?<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea. Do you have any ideas for marketing?<p class=message>Yeah, actually. I was thinking of doing a book tour, maybe hitting up some indie bookstores.<p class="message sent">That's a great plan. What about social media?<p class=message>Oh, definitely. I'm going to be posting on all my accounts leading up to the release. Maybe do a few giveaways too.<p class="message sent">That sounds fantastic. Have you thought about cover art yet?<p class=message>I have some ideas, but I'm open to suggestions. I want it to be eye-catching and fun.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. Have you considered collaborating with an artist for the cover?<p class=message>That's not a bad idea. Do you have anyone in mind?<p class="message sent">I know a few freelancers who specialize in book cover art. I can send you some portfolios if you're interested.<p class=message>That would be amazing. Thanks, B!<p class="message sent">No problem. Anything else we need to discuss?<p class=message>Not that I can think of right now. I'm really excited about this book and the publishing plan.<p class="message sent">Me too, A. I think it's going to be great.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9d4f1fa6-08bb-43ed-b355-ec633f1df16c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
