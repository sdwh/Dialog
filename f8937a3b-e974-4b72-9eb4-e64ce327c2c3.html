I have a sweet tooth, so I'm really looking forward to this.<p class="message sent">Well, you're in good company. Chocolate is one of Spain's favorite sweets.<p class=message>That's good to know.

Spanish chocolate-making is a cherished art form that's been passed down for generations. It's truly special.<p class=message>That's amazing.
