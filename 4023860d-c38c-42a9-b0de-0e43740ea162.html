What do you think is the most challenging part of working in a restaurant?<p class=message>For me, it's definitely keeping up with the demand during peak hours. But it's also what makes it exciting and challenging.<p class="message sent">That's true. What's your favorite dish to prepare?<p class=message>I love cooking Korean BBQ. It's a fun and interactive dish that our customers love to cook themselves.<p class="message sent">Sounds delicious. Do you have any funny or interesting kitchen stories to share?<p class=message>Once, we accidentally spilled a huge pot of soup and it went everywhere. We spent hours cleaning up, but we all couldn't stop laughing about how it happened.<p class="message sent">Oh no, I hope no one got burned! What do you like most about working in this restaurant?<p class=message>Definitely the team. We all have great chemistry and we work well together. It makes the work more enjoyable.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. Well, thank you for the excellent service tonight. We enjoyed every dish and will definitely come back again.<p class=message>Thank you very much for dining with us. It was our pleasure to serve you. Have a great evening!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4022ee91-619c-4a7f-a81b-b4e240df3cbd.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
