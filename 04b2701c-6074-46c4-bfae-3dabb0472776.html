It's been a while since we've seen each other. How have you been?<p class="message sent message-content">Hey, A! Yeah, it has been a while. I've been good, thanks for asking. What about you?<p class="message received message-content">I've been busy dealing with DDoS attacks on our clients' networks. It's getting pretty intense lately. What do you think we can do to counter them?<p class="message sent message-content">DDoS attacks can be tough to handle, but we can always start by implementing strong firewalls and intrusion detection systems. We can also limit the number of requests per IP address to prevent the attacks.<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, those are great ideas. But what about the attackers that use botnets with millions of IP addresses? How do we counter those?<p class="message sent message-content">We can use a technique called rate limiting. This means we can limit the amount of traffic from each IP in real-time, without having to block any legitimate requests.<p class="message received message-content">That sounds like a good approach. And what about cloud-based services? How can we deal with DDoS attacks on those?<p class="message sent message-content">For cloud-based services, we can use specialized security cloud solutions that can deploy any threat intelligence, detect and mitigate any DDoS traffic at the edge of the network.<p class="message received message-content">Wow, that's pretty impressive. You certainly know your stuff, B.<p class="message sent message-content">Haha, thanks, A. I try my best. But the truth is, with DDoS attacks, we constantly have to stay on our toes and ready to adapt and implement new solutions.<p class="message received message-content">Yeah, you're right. It's a cat-and-mouse game. But as long as we keep learning and improving, we can stay ahead of the game.<p class="message sent message-content">Agreed. And on a lighter note, have you seen the latest episode of that show we both like?<p class="message received message-content">No, I haven't. But tell me all about it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=04aeced8-89b7-4dfd-9a67-7fa8e5d9140b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
