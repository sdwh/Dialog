Have you had a chance to check out the new SQL Server we're using for the e-commerce system?<p class="message sent">Hey A, yes I have. I've already started designing the data tables for the system. It's actually pretty straightforward.<p class=message>That's great to hear. I'm curious, what approach are you taking for the design? Are you using normalization or denormalization?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm leaning towards normalization. It makes querying and maintaining the data much easier. Plus, it reduces the chance of data anomalies.<p class=message>I agree. And since this is an e-commerce system, we need to make sure that the data is accurate and consistent. How many normal forms are you targeting for the tables?<p class="message sent">Ideally, I'd like to have all the tables in third normal form. But I'm also considering using fourth normal form for some of the tables to further reduce redundancy.<p class=message>That makes sense. I'm also thinking about incorporating some triggers and stored procedures to automate certain tasks. Have you thought about that?<p class="message sent">Definitely. I think it's a good idea. It saves time and reduces the chance of human error. I'm planning on using triggers for auditing changes to the data, and stored procedures for complex queries.<p class=message>That sounds like a solid plan. Hey, do you think we should also include a backup and recovery plan for the database in case of any unforeseen disasters?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's crucial to have a reliable backup and recovery plan. I think we should also consider implementing a disaster recovery system to ensure that data is available in case of a major outage.<p class=message>Agreed. You're really on top of things, B. I'm glad we're working on this project together.<p class="message sent">Thanks, A. I'm confident that the new e-commerce system will be a big success with our collective effort.<p class=message>Definitely. Let's keep up the good work and create something amazing!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0f06ddb1-3894-4699-b96d-2661170e7d22.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
