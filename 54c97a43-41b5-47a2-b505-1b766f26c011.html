I'm the restaurant manager. Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm the cocktail maker. Pleasure to meet you too!<p class=message>So, what's the plan for tonight? Is it going to be a busy one?<p class="message sent">I think so. We have a few groups of people coming in to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries.<p class=message>Ah, that's great news! By the way, have you tried our new menu yet?<p class="message sent">Not yet, but I heard the cocktails are amazing.<p class=message>Yes! We've added some new flavors and ingredients. Would you like to give them a try?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Let's start with the classics first, like the Old Fashioned and the Martini.<p class=message>Sounds good. I'll also recommend our signature cocktail, the Blushing Dragon.<p class="message sent">The Blushing Dragon? That's an interesting name. What's in it?<p class=message>It's a mix of dragonfruit, lychee, and gin. It's perfect for those who love sweet and sour drinks.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds adventurous! Let's give it a try.<p class=message>Great! While you're making the cocktails, I'll make sure the food is prepared and ready for our guests.<p class="message sent">Let's do this! I'll make sure the drinks are Instagram-worthy too.<p class=message>Yes, we want our guests to have a memorable experience. Cheers to that!<p class="message sent">Cheers! By the way, have you ever made a flaming cocktail before?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is that something you can do?<p class="message sent">Definitely! We can do a Flaming Lamborghini or a Blue Blazer. It's always a crowd-pleaser.<p class=message>Well, let's save that for the grand finale. I'm sure everyone will love it.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Let's make sure tonight is a success!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=54c90074-8a4f-4ca1-bd54-8075b8f48e01.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
