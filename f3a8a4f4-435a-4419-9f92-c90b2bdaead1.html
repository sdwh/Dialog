How can I help you today?<p class="message sent">Actually, I want to learn ASP.NET Core, but I have no idea where to start.<p class=message>That's great! I'm a seasoned software engineer, and I'd be happy to help. Have you coded in any language before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have some experience with Java.<p class=message>Well, that's a great start. ASP.NET Core is similar to Java in many ways. Do you have Visual Studio installed on your computer?<p class="message sent">No, I don't. Is it needed?<p class=message>Yes, it is an essential tool for ASP.NET Core development. You can download the free version, Visual Studio Community, from Microsoft's website.<p class="message sent">Okay, I will do that. What's next?<p class=message>You can start familiarizing yourself with ASP.NET Core by watching some online tutorials. There are plenty of resources on Pluralsight, Udemy, and YouTube.<p class="message sent">Hmm, are there any tutorials that you highly recommend?<p class=message>Sure, I'd recommend the Microsoft documentation on ASP.NET Core. It covers everything from the basics to the advanced features.<p class="message sent">Thanks, I will check that out. What about books? Do you have any favorites?<p class=message>Yes, definitely! I highly recommend "Pro ASP.NET Core MVC 2" by Adam Freeman. It's a comprehensive guide that covers all aspects of ASP.NET Core development.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a useful resource. I will add that to my reading list.<p class=message>Great! Don't forget to practice what you learn by building small projects. You can start with a simple web application that displays some text on a page and gradually add more features.<p class="message sent">That's a good idea. It will help me apply what I learn in real-world scenarios.<p class=message>Exactly! And don't hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck on something. The ASP.NET community is very supportive, and there are many forums and groups dedicated to helping beginners.<p class="message sent">Thank you so much for your help and advice, A. This is going to be a fun and exciting journey.<p class=message>You're welcome, B. Learning ASP.NET Core is a great decision, and I'm sure you'll do great. Let me know if you need any more help.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f3a74b17-9cfb-487b-914d-70ffde928853.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
