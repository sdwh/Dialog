Welcome to the Sydney Opera House. I'm so excited to perform for you tonight.<p class="message sent">We're thrilled to be here! Your music has been a highlight of our trip to Australia so far.<p class=message>That's great to hear! What's been your favorite part of the trip so far?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely seeing the amazing wildlife here. We went to an animal sanctuary and got to see kangaroos and koalas up close.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds incredible. I haven't had a chance to do much sightseeing yet. I've been practicing non-stop for this concert!<p class="message sent">I can imagine. We're really looking forward to hearing your performance tonight. What do you have planned?<p class=message>Well, I'll be playing a mix of classical and contemporary pieces on the piano. I also have a special surprise guest who will be joining me on stage for a duet.<p class="message sent">That's so exciting! Who is it?<p class=message>It's a secret for now, but I promise you won't be disappointed.<p class="message sent">We trust your judgment. So, how long have you been playing the piano?<p class=message>I've been playing since I was a kid, so about twenty years now. It's hard work, but so rewarding.<p class="message sent">I can only imagine. Do you have any advice for someone who wants to learn an instrument?<p class=message>Absolutely. First of all, find an instrument you're passionate about. Then, practice consistently, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. Also, don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's part of the learning process!<p class="message sent">That's very wise. Thank you for sharing that. Well, we better take our seats now. Can't wait for the concert to start!<p class=message>Thank you for coming. I hope you enjoy the show!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8d125a9c-4bfc-44c8-a738-ee3a597ce46f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
