How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm great, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, but I'm concerned about the huge amount of air mail we've been sending out lately.<p class="message sent">Yes, I've noticed that too. What do you suggest we do to reduce it?<p class=message>I was thinking of encouraging our employees to use electronic mail more often instead of air mail. Also, we can try to negotiate with our shipping providers for better rates.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea. We can also provide training to our employees on how to use electronic mail more efficiently.<p class=message>Yes, that's a good point. We could also put up posters around the office reminding people to reduce air mail usage.<p class="message sent">We can also make sure that employees are aware of the environmental impact of air mail and how reducing its usage can benefit the planet.<p class=message>Absolutely! And maybe we could set up a competition in the office to see which department can reduce air mail usage the most!<p class="message sent">What a fun idea! We can give prizes to the winning department. That will motivate people to participate and make the effort to reduce our air mail usage.<p class=message>Great! It seems like we have a plan in place. Let's get started and see how much we can reduce our air mail usage.<p class="message sent">Sounds good, A! I'm excited to see how this turns out.<p class=message>Thanks for your help, B. You always have great ideas.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. It's always a pleasure to help out.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e8e24601-2379-4762-a61e-c7b78bcb0eb9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
