How are you all doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, teacher! I'm doing well, thank you.<p class=message>That's great to hear. We're going to start today's lesson by practicing some conversational English.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. I always struggle with talking in English.<p class=message>Don't worry, we'll work on it together. Let's start with this question: If you could have any superpower, what would it be?<p class="message sent">Hmm, that's a tough one. Maybe the ability to fly?<p class=message>Ah, a classic choice. I would choose telekinesis myself - imagine all the things you could do without even lifting a finger!<p class="message sent">That's true, but flying would be so liberating. Being able to soar through the air would be amazing.<p class=message>I can't argue with that. Now, let's try another question. If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you choose?<p class="message sent">I've always wanted to visit Japan, so maybe there.<p class=message>Interesting choice. I've never been myself, but I've heard it's a beautiful country. I think I would choose Italy - the food, the art, the culture... it's all so wonderful.<p class="message sent">Yeah, Italy sounds amazing. Maybe we should plan a class trip there sometime!<p class=message>(laughs) That would be quite the adventure. Alright, let's move on to the next question. If you could switch lives with anyone for a day, who would it be?<p class="message sent">Hmm, maybe a famous actor or musician. It would be cool to see what their life is like.<p class=message>I can see why you would choose that. For me, I would switch lives with an astronaut. Imagine getting to see the Earth from space!<p class="message sent">Wow, that would be an incredible experience. But I think I'll stick to the glamour and fame of the entertainment world for now.<p class=message>(smiling) Whatever floats your boat, B. Alright class, that's all for today's conversational English practice. Good work, everyone!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=796cdd40-1c39-4cd3-9cf4-df4351a03595.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
