We're using jQuery for the front-end and ASP.NET MVC 5 for the back-end, right?<p class=message>That's correct! Are you familiar with both technologies?<p class="message sent">I'm more of a back-end guy, but I know enough about jQuery to get by. How about you?<p class=message>I'm a front-end developer, so jQuery is definitely my forte. But I'm excited to learn more about ASP.NET MVC 5 too.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I'm always up for learning new technologies too. Speaking of which, have you tried any new front-end frameworks lately?<p class=message>Actually, I've been trying out React recently. It's been gaining a lot of popularity and it seems pretty cool.<p class="message sent">Nice! Well, if you ever need any help with the back-end stuff, feel free to give me a shout.<p class=message>Thanks, I appreciate that. And if you want any tips on front-end development, I'm more than happy to help too.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Hey, do you know any good web development podcasts?<p class=message>Yeah, I listen to Syntax and ShopTalk Show. They're both informative and entertaining at the same time.<p class="message sent">Oh cool, I'll have to check those out. Hey, on a completely unrelated note, did you catch the game last night?<p class=message>I did! Can you believe that last-minute goal? It was insane.<p class="message sent">Tell me about it! That's what makes sports so exciting though, you never know what will happen.<p class=message>Absolutely, and developing new websites can be just as exhilarating when you finally get everything working smoothly.<p class="message sent">Totally agree. I guess we share a passion for both technology and sports.<p class=message>Haha, yeah I guess we do. It's always good to have some common ground.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a6cbefe2-9b73-4142-8eb2-8ea397bf8875.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
