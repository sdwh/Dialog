How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm doing pretty good. So I've been thinking about this new book idea and I was wondering if you could give me some feedback.<p class="message sent">Of course, fire away!<p class=message>Well, it's a romantic comedy about two people who meet in a coffee shop.<p class="message sent">Hmm, interesting. What's the twist?<p class=message>The twist is that one of them is a ghost who doesn't know that they're dead.<p class="message sent">(laughs) Wow, that's definitely unexpected. I think it could work though.<p class=message>Really? I was worried it might be too out there.<p class="message sent">No, I think readers these days are looking for something unique and different. Plus, a romantic comedy with a supernatural twist could attract a wider audience.<p class=message>That's true. Okay, so what do you think about the title "Love in Limbo"?<p class="message sent">I like it! It's catchy and it captures the essence of the book.<p class=message>Great, thank you so much for your input. Now, let's talk about the marketing strategy.<p class="message sent">Sure, let's hear it.<p class=message>I want to do a promotional event in a coffee shop where we actually film a scene from the book. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That's a fantastic idea. It's interactive and it'll get people excited for the book release.<p class=message>Perfect, let's do it! Thanks again for all your help, B.<p class="message sent">Anytime, A. I'm looking forward to seeing this book come to life.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=7220ca78-022a-4ea1-9317-d7be8e3718f8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
