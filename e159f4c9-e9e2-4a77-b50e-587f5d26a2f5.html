Today, we have a special guest with us – B, a software engineer. Welcome to the show, B!<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, excited to be here!<p class=message>We're excited to have you here, B. So, let's dive into the topic of JavaScript. Can you tell us about the latest technologies in JavaScript?<p class="message sent">Absolutely, A! One of the latest technologies in JavaScript is React Native, which allows developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It's a game-changer for developing cross-platform mobile apps.<p class=message>That sounds interesting! How does it differ from traditional app development?<p class="message sent">Well, traditional mobile app development requires coding in different languages for different operating systems, which is time-consuming. But React Native allows you to write code once and deploy it across different platforms, which saves a lot of time and effort.<p class=message>Wow, that’s really impressive! Are there any other technologies that are making waves in the world of JavaScript?<p class="message sent">Yes, A, there’s also Node.js, which is a platform that allows developers to build scalable applications using JavaScript on the server-side. It's faster and more efficient than traditional server-side languages like Java or Ruby.<p class=message>Fascinating! So, what do you think about the future of JavaScript?<p class="message sent">I think the future of JavaScript is bright, A. It’s one of the most popular languages, and it's constantly evolving. With new technologies like React Native and Node.js, the possibilities are endless!<p class=message>That's great to hear, B! I think we are all excited about what the future holds for JavaScript. Thank you so much for joining us today and sharing your expertise with us.<p class="message sent">Thank you for having me, A. It was a pleasure to be here!<p class=message>That’s all for today, folks! Stay tuned for our next episode. Thank you for tuning in!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e1598faa-879f-4641-9626-ccde030dce02.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
