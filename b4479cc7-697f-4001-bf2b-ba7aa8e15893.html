Are you ready to teach me the secrets of making authentic Thai red-braised pork?<p class="message sent">Of course, Manager A! I'm excited to share my expertise with you. First, we need to marinate the pork in a blend of fish sauce, sugar, and soy sauce for 30 minutes.<p class=message>That sounds easy enough. What's next?<p class="message sent">Then, we stir-fry the pork with garlic, shallots, and chili peppers until the meat turns aromatic and slightly crispy.<p class=message>Yum, my mouth is watering already. How about the side dishes?<p class="message sent">To balance out the richness of the meat, we can blanch some Chinese kale and dress it with garlic oil and oyster sauce. We can also make some jasmine rice as a base.<p class=message>Sounds like a perfect combination. I can't wait to try it. By the way, have you ever made any funny kitchen mistakes?<p class="message sent">Oh, definitely. One time, I accidentally added sugar instead of salt to a soup, and it turned out to be a dessert instead. But hey, sometimes mistakes lead to new creations!<p class=message>Haha, true. Speaking of creations, do you have any signature dish that you're particularly proud of?<p class="message sent">Yes, I make a killer panang curry with beef. It's creamy, spicy, and fragrant all at once. Maybe I can teach you that next time!<p class=message>Absolutely, I'd love to learn. Thanks for being such a great teacher today, Chef B.<p class="message sent">My pleasure, Manager A. Let's dig in and enjoy our delicious meal!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b44769ef-f700-4273-a0c5-8b573ba029d0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
