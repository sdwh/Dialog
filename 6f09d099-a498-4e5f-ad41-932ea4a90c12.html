It's just around the corner, follow me, I can help you out.<p class=message>Thank you, that's very kind of you. These vegetables are freshly picked, and it's important to store them at the right temperature.<p class="message sent">I bet you have plenty of experience delivering food. I'm curious - what's the weirdest thing you've ever delivered?<p class=message>Hmm, let me think...once I delivered a package of live crickets to a pet store. They were so loud, I thought they would escape from the box!<p class="message sent">Oh wow, that's a strange one. But it's good to know that there's someone out there who can deliver just about anything! So, what's the biggest challenge you face on the job?<p class=message>Definitely traffic! It's a nightmare sometimes. But I try to stay focused and just keep driving safely.<p class="message sent">I hear you. Moving heavy loads around all day is tough, too. But it's great to work with a team, and we all help each other out.<p class=message>Yeah, teamwork is crucial! And speaking of that, let me give you a hand with those heavy boxes. The last thing we want is for anyone to get injured.<p class="message sent">Thanks a lot, much appreciated. By the way, do you have any tips for keeping these veggies fresh?<p class=message>Sure, always keep them in a cool, dry place, and make sure to rotate them so that the older ones get used up first. And of course, handle them with care!<p class="message sent">Gotcha, sounds easy enough. Hey, have you ever tried any of these vegetables? They look really good.<p class=message>Actually, I have! I'm a big fan of bell peppers, they're great in stir-fry dishes or on the grill. And I highly recommend the heirloom tomatoes too!<p class="message sent">Awesome, I'll have to try that out. Thanks for the advice. Alright, let's finish up these boxes and get them out to the shelves.<p class=message>Sounds good to me! Thanks again for your help, it's been great working with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=6f05f8e7-71f4-45a0-bc53-b6427816e2e5.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
