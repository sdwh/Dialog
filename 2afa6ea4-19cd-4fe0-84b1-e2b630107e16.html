How's it going today?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! It's been pretty busy actually, but I always enjoy the rush. How about you?<p class=message>Same here. It's always good to see a full house in this bar. Are you ready to mix up some cocktails?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! What would you recommend for our first guest tonight?<p class=message>Let's start with a classic. How about a margarita for the lady over there?<p class="message sent">Sounds good. I'll make it with freshly squeezed lime juice.<p class=message>Perfect. And for the gentleman at the end of the bar, maybe a whiskey sour?<p class="message sent">Got it. I'll use a top shelf whiskey and add some egg white to make it extra frothy.<p class=message>That sounds very tasty. Hey, have you heard about the drink competition in London next month?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I have! I'm actually thinking of entering with my own signature cocktail. Want to come and cheer me on?<p class=message>Of course! And maybe we can do some sightseeing too. London is such a cool city.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I'm excited to see what the other contestants come up with too. It's always great to learn new tricks.<p class=message>Speaking of tricks, have you ever tried juggling bottles while making drinks?<p class="message sent">I have, but I'm not very good at it. I always end up spilling something. How about you?<p class=message>Ha! I attempted it once and almost knocked over a whole shelf of liquor. I think I'll stick to just making drinks.<p class="message sent">Same here. Well, these cocktails are ready to be served. Let's wow our customers with our skills!<p class=message>Cheers to that!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2af6a063-821f-456d-a749-ce9857c79ca9.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
