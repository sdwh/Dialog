It's so good. What's your favorite song on the album?<p class=message>Hmm, I would say "Blinding Lights". It's so catchy and I can't help but dance to it.<p class="message sent">Yeah, that's a great one. I also really like "Heartless" and "In Your Eyes".<p class=message>Oh yeah, those are solid choices too. But have you listened to any other artists recently?<p class="message sent">Actually, I've been really into Hozier's latest album. The lyrics are so powerful and his voice is so mesmerizing.<p class=message>I totally agree. His song "Take Me To Church" is still one of my all-time favorites.<p class="message sent">Speaking of favorites, who's your favorite band of all time?<p class=message>That's a tough one. I would have to say Queen. Freddie Mercury's voice was just out of this world.<p class="message sent">Yes! Queen is definitely up there for me too. "Bohemian Rhapsody" is an absolute classic.<p class=message>You know what else is a classic? Michael Jackson's "Thriller" album. It's been almost 40 years since its release and it's still just as popular.<p class="message sent">Definitely. MJ was a true icon and "Thriller" is a masterpiece. But what about newer artists? Anyone you're excited about?<p class=message>Well, I've been really enjoying Billie Eilish's music lately. She's only 18 and already making waves in the industry.<p class="message sent">I know, right? She's incredibly talented and her style is so unique.<p class=message>It's always great when artists can bring something fresh and different to the table.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. And speaking of bringing something fresh, have you heard of the band Glass Animals? They have a really interesting sound.<p class=message>I haven't, but I'll definitely check them out. Thanks for the recommendation!<p class="message sent">No problem! I'm always happy to share new music with people.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9c0dccc4-5d78-427e-bd5e-b47c65ec4fb6.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
