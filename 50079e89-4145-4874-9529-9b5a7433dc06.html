Have you considered using microservices? They're a great way to have smaller, more easily manageable components.<p class="message sent">Yeah, we've definitely been looking into that. We're also thinking about using Kubernetes for container orchestration.<p class=message>Nice, that would definitely make scaling easier. Have you thought about using a distributed database like Cassandra?<p class="message sent">Actually, we've discussed that too. We like the idea of having the data spread out more for high availability.<p class=message>That makes sense. Just make sure the consistency model is right for your use case. What about using a content delivery network for static assets?<p class="message sent">Good point. That would help with latency issues. We've been looking at CloudFront or Akamai for that.<p class=message>Ah, I've used CloudFront before and it was pretty straightforward. Have you considered setting up monitoring and alerting with something like Prometheus?<p class="message sent">Definitely, we need to make sure we can catch issues quickly. We're just trying to figure out the best way to configure it all.<p class=message>Well, if you need any help, I'd be happy to pitch in. And in the meantime, let's grab a drink and brainstorm some more ideas.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4fff9422-4230-4273-af1c-e3c2bba997c7.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
