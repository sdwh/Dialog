How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Doctor A. I'm doing great, thanks! How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. Ready to start a busy day?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. We have several patients scheduled today, and I'm eager to get started.<p class=message>That's great to hear. We have Mrs. Smith in room 3 for her yearly check-up.<p class="message sent">I remember her from last year. She's always so pleasant to talk to.<p class=message>Yes, and her blood pressure was slightly high at her last appointment, so we need to monitor that.<p class="message sent">I'm on it. And we have Mr. Jones in room 5 for his flu shot.<p class=message>Excellent. We don't want him getting sick with everything going on right now.<p class="message sent">Speaking of sickness, have you heard about that new virus?<p class=message>Yes, it's been all over the news. We need to make sure we're taking extra precautions to keep ourselves and our patients safe.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. On a lighter note, have you tried that new coffee place down the street?<p class=message>I haven't had the chance yet. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">It's amazing! They have this caramel macchiato that's to die for.<p class=message>Sounds like we need to make a coffee run during our lunch break.<p class="message sent">Great idea, Doctor. I'll start looking up their menu now.<p class=message>And then it's back to work to keep our patients healthy and happy.<p class="message sent">That's what we do best! Let's get started.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=056e6846-b1b8-46a3-b8a8-1046798a130a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
