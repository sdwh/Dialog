How are you?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great too. I'm excited to be working on this ISO 27001 audit with you. Have you had a chance to review the checklist?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It seems like we have our work cut out for us.<p class=message>Haha, yes, but I'm sure we'll make a great team. Do you have any favorite controls?<p class="message sent">I'm a big fan of the access controls. They are so important for data security.<p class=message>Agreed! And I personally love the incident management controls. It's always interesting to see how a company responds to incidents.<p class="message sent">That's true. Hopefully we won't find any incidents during our audit.<p class=message>Fingers crossed! But if we do, I'm sure we'll handle them quickly and efficiently.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. By the way, did you hear the latest joke in the IT department?<p class=message>No, what is it?<p class="message sent">Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!<p class=message>Hahaha, that's a good one! I'll have to share that with my team.<p class="message sent">Feel free to use it. Now, back to the audit. Have you started reviewing the security policy?<p class=message>Yes, I have. It looks pretty solid, but I'll be paying special attention to the password policy.<p class="message sent">Good call. That's a common weak spot for companies.<p class=message>Definitely. Since we're on the topic of passwords, have you heard of the guy who got fired from his job at a bank for using "password" as his password?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What happened?<p class=message>He couldn't believe it when they told him his account was hacked. Hahaha!<p class="message sent">Oh my, that's a good one. You definitely have a knack for jokes.<p class=message>Thanks, B! But let's not forget about our task at hand. We have a lot of work to do.<p class="message sent">Right you are, A. Let's get to it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a3696511-6c6c-4d77-8e61-1ae22d93668f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
