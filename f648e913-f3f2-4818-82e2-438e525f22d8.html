How's it going?<p class="message sent">Not bad, just getting everything set up for another night of grilling.<p class=message>Yeah, it looks like it's going to be a busy one. What do we have on the menu tonight?<p class="message sent">We've got some fresh catch of the day - snapper and grouper, and some sirloin steaks. Our customers love that surf and turf combo.<p class=message>Nice! I love grilling seafood. It's so much fun to experiment with different marinades and seasonings.<p class="message sent">Speaking of which, have you tried our new house BBQ sauce? It's got a secret blend of spices that we've been tinkering with for a while now. The customers are really digging it.<p class=message>Oh, I haven't had a chance to try it yet. Mind if I taste a bit?<p class="message sent">Here you go! Let me know what you think.<p class=message>Wow! This is amazing. It's got a perfect balance of sweetness and heat. I can see why people are raving about it.<p class="message sent">Great, I knew you'd like it. Hey, speaking of flavor, what's your go-to seasoning for seafood?<p class=message>Hmm, tough question. I usually like to keep it simple with just some salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice. But sometimes I'll throw in some smoked paprika or chili powder for a little kick.<p class="message sent">Nice choices. I'm more of a garlic and herb kind of guy myself. But hey, to each their own.<p class=message>For sure. That's the beauty of grilling - everyone can make it their own.<p class="message sent">I couldn't agree more. Alright, the grill is all heated up, and we've got a line forming. Time to get to work!<p class=message>Let's do it! I've got a feeling tonight's going to be a great night.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f64805d0-566e-4f9c-a6d0-9f925a85a494.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
