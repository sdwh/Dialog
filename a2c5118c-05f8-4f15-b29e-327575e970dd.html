Where are you headed?<p class=message>I'm on my way to Mumbai for a business meeting. How about you?<p class="message sent">Same here! Looks like we're going to be stuck together for a while.<p class=message>Haha, seems like it. At least the ride will be more enjoyable with someone to talk to. So, do you drive a lot?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I drive a lot. But I actually love it. You get to meet interesting people like yourself.<p class=message>That's true. Speaking of interesting, have you had any funny experiences with passengers before?<p class="message sent">Oh yes, I've had quite a few. One time, a passenger put a live chicken in the trunk thinking it was okay to bring on a ride.<p class=message>No way! That's hilarious. Have you ever been lost while driving?<p class="message sent">Yes, one time I got lost and ended up in the middle of an agricultural field. It was quite the adventure.<p class=message>Wow, you've had quite the experience as a driver. What do you usually do to pass the time on long drives?<p class="message sent">I usually listen to music or podcasts. What about you?<p class=message>I love to read, so I usually bring a few books with me. Speaking of which, have you read any good books lately?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I just finished a really good mystery novel. What about you?<p class=message>I recently read a self-help book and it was very motivating. Do you believe in the power of positive thinking?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! I think it's important to have a positive attitude towards life. It makes all the difference.<p class=message>I completely agree. Oh, we're almost here. It was nice chatting with you.<p class="message sent">Likewise, have a great business meeting!<p class=message>Thanks, you too. Take care.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=a2c40f75-da6f-4236-92d4-56e62b9f1845.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
