Your room comes with toiletries, towels and bed linens. You should be all set!<p class=message>Great, just wanted to make sure. Is there anything else you'd recommend or things to do around the area?<p class="message sent">Well, the hotel offers a few fun activities like morning yoga or bike tours, but if you're looking for something off property, I highly recommend visiting the local farmer's market. They have the best fresh produce.<p class=message>Awesome! I'm definitely interested in that. Where is it and what time does it run?<p class="message sent">It's just a 10 minute walk away and it runs every Saturday from 10am to 2pm. It's a really fun atmosphere.<p class=message>Sounds perfect. Thanks for the recommendation! Where are you traveling from?<p class="message sent">I'm from London. How about yourself?<p class=message>I'm from Tokyo. It's my first time in this area, so I'm excited to explore!<p class="message sent">Oh, that's really cool. What are some must-see places on your list?<p class=message>I definitely want to see the beach, try some local seafood and visit the nearby historic village.<p class="message sent">It sounds like you have a great itinerary planned! Have fun exploring and let us know if you need anything else during your stay.<p class=message>Thank you so much, I appreciate it. Can't wait to see what this area has to offer.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=617bd737-fe12-4f22-8fca-be9b224c54ca.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
