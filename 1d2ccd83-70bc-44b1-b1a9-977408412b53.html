How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks. I'm actually pretty excited to be heading to Manila.<p class="message sent">Ah, Manila! It's a beautiful city with lots to see and do. Have you been there before?<p class=message>No, this is actually my first time. What would you recommend I go see?<p class="message sent">Well, I think you should definitely check out Intramuros. It's the old walled city and there are a lot of historical sites there.<p class=message>That sounds interesting. Anything else?<p class="message sent">You should also go to Rizal Park. It's a great place to relax and take a walk. And while you're there, you might as well visit the National Museum.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan. I'm also hoping to try some delicious Filipino food.<p class="message sent">Oh, there's no shortage of that in Manila. Adobo, sinigang, and lechon are some of my favorites.<p class=message>Yum, those all sound great! I heard that traffic in Manila can be pretty bad. Do you have any tips for avoiding it?<p class="message sent">Well, it's pretty much inevitable, especially during rush hour. But if you can, try to avoid the main roads and take the side streets instead.<p class=message>Thanks for the advice. I'll keep that in mind.<p class="message sent">No problem! I hope you have a great time in Manila.<p class=message>Thanks, I'm sure I will. How much longer until we get there?<p class="message sent">We should be there in about 20 minutes, traffic permitting.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=1d2b00f9-861b-4259-b27c-9bf7fe274943.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
