How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, Dr. A. I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing great, thanks. Have you had a chance to review the patient's chart we're seeing today?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. The patient is here for a routine check-up.<p class=message>Fantastic. Let's get started then. So, Nurse B, how was your weekend?<p class="message sent">It was good, thanks. I spent some time with my family and also caught up on some reading. How about you?<p class=message>I went hiking with some friends. It was a beautiful day and we had a great time on the trails.<p class="message sent">That sounds like fun. Did you see any wildlife?<p class=message>Yes, we saw a family of deer and a few squirrels. It was quite refreshing to be out in nature.<p class="message sent">That's great. Speaking of nature, have you heard of that new park opening up in the city?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Tell me more about it.<p class="message sent">Well, it's called the Butterfly Garden Park and it's supposed to be a beautiful oasis in the middle of the city. I'm planning on taking my kids there this weekend.<p class=message>That sounds lovely. Let me know how it is, and maybe I'll have to take a trip there myself.<p class="message sent">Sure thing, Dr. A. Now, let's get back to our patient. Have you started the exam yet?<p class=message>No, I was waiting for you. Should we go ahead and get started?<p class="message sent">Yes, let's do it. And don't forget, we have another patient coming in after this, so we'll need to keep things on schedule.<p class=message>Of course, Nurse B. Thanks for the reminder. Let's get to it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=75f339e1-0abf-4695-b8f2-4e0499ee384c.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
