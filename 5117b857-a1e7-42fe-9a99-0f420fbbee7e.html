And we should definitely collaborate with influencers to expand our reach.<p class=message>Yes! And we can also run some fun contests and giveaways to engage our followers.<p class="message sent">Definitely. And what about email marketing?<p class=message>It's still important. We can send newsletters and exclusive offers to our subscribers.<p class="message sent">Right. We should make sure the content is valuable and not just promotional.<p class=message>Agreed. And let's not forget about SEO optimization.<p class="message sent">Of course. We need to make sure our website is easily searchable and accessible.<p class=message>Exactly. And we can also try experimenting with video marketing to keep things fresh.<p class="message sent">That's a great idea! We could make some funny or informative videos to share on social media.<p class=message>Yes! It's important to have fun and be creative while also being strategic.<p class="message sent">For sure. With you leading the team, I know we'll come up with some great ideas.<p class=message>Aw, thanks B! You're a valuable member of the team too.
