Look at these croissants, they're freshly baked right out of the oven.<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! They do look great. Did you also make the pain au chocolat that's right next to them?<p class=message>Yes, I did. I also made some macarons and eclairs last night.<p class="message sent">Wow, you're a real expert in French pastry. I'm glad I hired you as my main baker.<p class=message>Thank you, Boss. It's been a dream of mine to work in a bakery like this.<p class="message sent">Well, you're doing a great job. Our customers are loving your creations.<p class=message>Speaking of customers, I noticed that we've been getting a lot of positive feedback online. People are really enjoying our special pastries.<p class="message sent">That's amazing to hear. We must be doing something right.<p class=message>Definitely. Oh, by the way, I brought some samples of a new pastry I've been experimenting with. Would you like to try them?<p class="message sent">Yes, please! What is it exactly?<p class=message>It's a twist on the classic cheesecake. I added some matcha powder to the filling and made a black sesame crust.<p class="message sent">That sounds really interesting. Let's give it a taste. Wow, it's delicious! You're a genius, A.<p class=message>Thank you so much, Boss. I'm glad you like it. Maybe we can add it to our menu?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I'm sure it will be a hit with our customers.<p class=message>Great! I'm excited to keep experimenting and creating new pastries.<p class="message sent">Me too, A.
