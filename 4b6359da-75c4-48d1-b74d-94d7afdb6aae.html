I heard we'll be using Vue.js for the front-end and ASP.NET MVC 5 for the back-end. What do you think about that?<p class=message>Personally, I think it's a great choice! Vue.js is a popular and efficient library that's easy to learn and use.<p class="message sent">I agree. It's also great for creating interactive user interfaces and single-page applications.<p class=message>Definitely! Plus, ASP.NET MVC 5 is a reliable and secure backend framework that's been around for a while.<p class="message sent">That's right. It's also great for creating complex web applications with a lot of functionality.<p class=message>I'm really excited to work on this project. It'll be a great opportunity to improve our skills with these technologies.<p class="message sent">Me too! I'm always down for learning new things and expanding my knowledge.<p class=message>Speaking of which, have you looked into any helpful resources for learning Vue.js or ASP.NET MVC 5?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've been checking out some online tutorials and documentation. How about you?<p class=message>Same here! I also found some great courses on Udemy that I plan on taking.<p class="message sent">Nice! We should definitely share resources and support each other on this project.<p class=message>Agreed! It's always helpful to have a partner to bounce ideas off of and troubleshoot any issues that come up.<p class="message sent">For sure. And who knows, we might even come up with some innovative features that could make this website system even better!<p class=message>That would be amazing! I can't wait to see what we create.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4b60b326-5723-49e3-86f4-5470237fdcc4.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
