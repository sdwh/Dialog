What's on the menu today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! We've got some delicious espresso drinks and some tasty desserts. Have you tried our matcha latte yet?<p class=message>No, I haven't. It sounds interesting though. Does it go well with any of your pastries?<p class="message sent">Definitely! It goes great with our green tea tiramisu, which is one of our most popular desserts.<p class=message>That sounds amazing! I think I'll have a matcha latte and a slice of that tiramisu.<p class="message sent">Great choice! What can I get for you?<p class=message>I'll have a cappuccino and the chocolate lava cake, please.<p class="message sent">Excellent, coming right up!<p class=message>How long have you been working here at this caf√©? I always see you bustling around.<p class="message sent">A few years now, but it doesn't feel like it. Time flies when you're having fun, right?<p class=message>Absolutely. What are your favorite items on the menu? I'm always curious to hear from the experts.<p class="message sent">Definitely the vanilla latte and our raspberry cheesecake. You can't go wrong with those.<p class=message>Oh, I'll have to try them next time. Hey, do you ever do any latte art? I've always been impressed by that.<p class="message sent">Yes, definitely! Would you like a customized one with your order?<p class=message>Really? That would be great! How about something with a heart design, if it's not too much trouble?<p class="message sent">Of course, consider it done. Hey, that's our order up! Enjoy your drinks and desserts.<p class=message>Thank you! Same to you. It was nice chatting with you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=2a89682a-090b-4948-8492-f6e03f9a9ae3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
