How are you today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm doing great, thank you. How about you?<p class=message>I'm doing well, thanks. Say, have you tried our new strawberry shortcake? It's been a hit with our customers.<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. But I did bring in some new matcha from Japan that I think would go great with it.<p class=message>That sounds like a delicious combination. Maybe we could offer a special promotion with the two together?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! And while we're at it, have you thought about introducing some French-inspired pastries to our menu?<p class=message>Funny you should mention that. I've been working on a batch of croissants that I think would be perfect for our customers.<p class="message sent">Wonderful! And perhaps we could serve them alongside some matcha lattes for a unique twist on the classic croissant and coffee combo.<p class=message>Brilliant! We make a great team, don't we?<p class="message sent">Definitely. It's always fun to collaborate with someone who shares the same passion for creating delicious and unique treats.<p class=message>Agreed. Speaking of which, do you have any new tea blends or flavors to try?<p class="message sent">As a matter of fact, I just got in a new batch of sencha that has a light, sweet flavor that would pair well with our fruit tarts.<p class=message>Perfect! Let's make sure to feature it on our menu with a description of its unique qualities.<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. We'll have to invite our regulars in to try our new creations.<p class=message>Absolutely. And who knows? Maybe we'll even attract some new customers with our unique and delicious offerings.<p class="message sent">Here's hoping! It's all about spreading the love of good food and drink.<p class=message>Well put, my friend. Let's get to work!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=eb684996-0f2f-41d9-8f3d-8e3cb8b24230.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
