It's been a while since we've caught up.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. How have you been?<p class=message>Busy as usual, working on a new book idea. Actually, that's what I wanted to discuss with you.<p class="message sent">Okay, I'm all ears. What's the idea?<p class=message>Well, it's a romance novel set in the 1920s. Think flapper dresses, jazz music, and prohibition-era speakeasies.<p class="message sent">Sounds interesting. What's the target audience?<p class=message>I'm thinking it would appeal to both younger and older readers who enjoy historical fiction with a romantic twist.<p class="message sent">That's a broad audience. Can you give me a brief synopsis?<p class=message>Sure. It's about a young woman who falls in love with a jazz musician but struggles to balance her passion with the social expectations of the time.<p class="message sent">I like it. Do you have a title in mind?<p class=message>Tentatively, it's called "Star-Crossed Swing".<p class="message sent">Oh, I like it. Have you started writing it yet?<p class=message>Yes, I'm about a quarter of the way through.<p class="message sent">Great. Do you have a deadline in mind?<p class=message>I'm hoping to finish the manuscript in about 6 months.<p class="message sent">Okay, we can work with that. I'll start looking into publishers who would be a good fit for this book.<p class=message>Thanks, B. You always know what to do.<p class="message sent">It's my job, A. But I'm excited to see how this book turns out.<p class=message>Me too. It's definitely a departure from my usual fare, so I'm nervous but also excited.<p class="message sent">That's a good sign. It means you're pushing yourself as a writer.<p class=message>I hope so. But for now, how about we order a cup of coffee and catch up some more?<p class="message sent">Sounds like a plan. Let's do that.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=24b13b3c-eb0a-4ff6-88b3-b01c31c8be40.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
