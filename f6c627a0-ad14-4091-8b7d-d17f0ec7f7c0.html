I work for a car rental company and was hoping to get some information about how to operate at this airport.<p class=message>Sure thing, we're happy to help. Have you operated at airports before?<p class="message sent">Yes, but each airport has their own unique procedures and policies, so I'm hoping to get a better understanding of what we need to do here.<p class=message>Of course. We have designated rental car pickup areas located just outside of baggage claim. Our team will assist with directing customers to your company's spot.<p class="message sent">That sounds great. Can you give me an idea of the peak hours for rentals here?<p class=message>Typically, we see the most rentals early in the morning and late in the evening. However, we recommend having staff available throughout the day in case of fluctuations in demand.<p class="message sent">That's helpful to know. Are there any permits or agreements we need to obtain before operating here?<p class=message>Yes, we require all rental companies at this airport to have a permit and provide proof of insurance. You can find more information and applications on our website.<p class="message sent">Alright, thank you for the information. Is there anything else we should be aware of?<p class=message>One thing to note is that our off-site rental car return lot is located a short shuttle ride away from the airport. We provide shuttle service every 10 minutes and recommend advising customers to budget extra time for returning the vehicle.<p class="message sent">Understood, we'll be sure to inform our customers of that. Thank you for your assistance today!<p class=message>My pleasure, let me know if you have any further questions. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f6c30fb6-fa76-45ec-b3f6-06ea37f9a0d0.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
