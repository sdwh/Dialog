How about you?<p class="message received message-content">Not too bad. I'm here to inspect the quality of your catch today.<p class="message sent message-content">That's great. We always strive for the best quality fish.<p class="message received message-content">That's good to hear. I noticed that some of the fish are a little bruised. Perhaps handling them with more care could improve their value.<p class="message sent message-content">Yes, we'll make sure to be more gentle with them in the future. Do you have any other suggestions?<p class="message received message-content">Well, I also noticed that some of the fish are not as fresh as they could be. It's important to keep them on ice and in good condition as soon as they're caught.<p class="message sent message-content">Absolutely. We'll make sure to stick to our high standards.<p class="message received message-content">That's great to hear. I also think that working more closely with the chefs and restaurants in the area could help to increase the value of your fish.<p class="message sent message-content">That's an interesting idea. We'll look into it.<p class="message received message-content">Wonderful! I'm glad that I could be of help.<p class="message sent message-content">Thank you, we always appreciate having an expert eye.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=0c720d5b-3cf1-431a-a8e4-cb6811a6f2ac.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
