How about you?<p class=message>Pretty good, just trying to wrap my head around this new JavaScript library we're using for this project.<p class="message sent">Yeah, it can be a bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty powerful.<p class=message>Agreed. Have you tried the new feature that was added in the latest update?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it do?<p class=message>It allows you to easily create animations without having to write a ton of code. It's pretty neat.<p class="message sent">That sounds awesome! I'll have to check it out. Have you seen any good movies lately?<p class=message>Actually, I just saw a really funny one last night. It had me laughing the whole time.<p class="message sent">Oh really? What was it called?<p class=message>It was called "Game Night". I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for some laughs.<p class="message sent">Thanks for the recommendation, I'll have to add it to my list. Have you tried the new Thai restaurant that just opened up down the street?<p class=message>No, I haven't. Is it any good?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I went there for lunch yesterday and it was fantastic. You should definitely check it out.<p class=message>Sounds good, maybe we can grab lunch there sometime this week.<p class="message sent">That would be great! Let me know when you're free and we'll make it happen.<p class=message>Will do. Alright, I better get back to coding. Talk to you later.<p class="message sent">Same here. See you later!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=78142407-968b-4373-885b-67ff7996d861.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
