These babies are looking mighty tasty.<p class=message>They sure are, but I wouldn't expect anything less from our famous Texas barbecue joint.<p class="message sent">Speaking of famous, did you hear about that celebrity who dined here yesterday?<p class=message>No way, who was it?<p class="message sent">Apparently it was Matthew McConaughey! He said our brisket was "alright, alright, alright."<p class=message>(laughs) That's amazing, I'll have to add that to our website testimonials.<p class="message sent">Definitely! By the way, have you tried our new bourbon-glazed ribs?<p class=message>Oh yeah, they have the perfect balance of sweet and smoky.<p class="message sent">I agree, but I still love our classic dry-rubbed ribs with a side of jalapeno coleslaw.<p class=message>Can't go wrong with a classic, that's for sure.<p class="message sent">Hey Chef, can I ask you for some grilling tips? My burgers always end up so dry.<p class=message>Of course! One tip is to never flip the burger more than once, and make sure to let it rest for a few minutes before serving.<p class="message sent">Thanks, Chef! I'll try that next time.<p class=message>Anytime, B. Teamwork makes the dream work in this kitchen.<p class="message sent">You got that right, Chef.
