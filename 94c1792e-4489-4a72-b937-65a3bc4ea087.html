It helps organizations keep their information assets safe from security risks.<p class="message sent">Ah, got it. So, what kind of threats does it cover?<p class=message>Well, it covers a wide range of threats, such as malware, hacking, phishing, and physical theft.<p class="message sent">That’s a lot of things to be worried about. How can we protect ourselves from all of that?<p class=message>One way is to implement security controls based on the ISO 27001 standard. It provides guidelines on how to identify, assess, and mitigate security risks.<p class="message sent">That sounds complicated. Can you give me an example?<p class=message>Sure! For example, you can implement access controls to restrict who can access sensitive information. You can also conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities in your systems.<p class="message sent">Okay, that makes sense. But what if a threat slips through the cracks?<p class=message>That's why it’s important to have an incident response plan in place. It outlines the steps to take in the event of a security breach.<p class="message sent">Good point. I guess prevention is key but being prepared is just as important.<p class=message>Exactly! Prevention is always better than cure, but sometimes it’s not enough. That’s why organizations need to be ready to respond quickly and effectively to any security incident.<p class="message sent">I couldn’t agree more. It’s better to be safe than sorry!<p class=message>That’s right. It’s always better to be one step ahead of the bad guys. So, have you thought about getting certified in ISO 27001?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have. I think it’ll be a great way to prove my expertise in information security management.<p class=message>Definitely! Plus, a certification in the gold level of TOEIC would be impressive as well.<p class="message sent">Ha! Thanks for the encouragement. Let’s keep working towards our goals!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=94be24c1-95ce-4180-a993-f6e2d7b13316.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
