How heavy is this cargo we need to deliver today?<p class="message sent">Good morning! It's not too heavy actually, just around 500 kilos.<p class=message>That's a relief. Could you please tell me how it should be loaded on the plane?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. We need to distribute the weight equally between the front and back sections of the plane. And please make sure to secure the cargo tightly.<p class=message>Absolutely. Safety is our top priority here. By the way, have you been to Tokyo before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It's a beautiful city with so much to see and do.<p class=message>That's great to know. I've always wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. Have you been there?<p class="message sent">Actually, I haven't been to Disneyland, but I did manage to catch a sumo wrestling match. It was quite an experience!<p class=message>Wow, that sounds really interesting! I haven't watched a sumo wrestling match before, but I heard it can get pretty intense.<p class="message sent">Yes, it definitely can! But it's a unique cultural experience that shouldn't be missed if you have the chance.<p class=message>I'll definitely keep that in mind. Speaking of cultural experiences, have you tried any traditional Japanese food?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. I love sushi and ramen. How about you? Have you tried any Japanese food?<p class=message>Of course, I've had sushi before. But my favorite is definitely tempura. It's so crispy and delicious!<p class="message sent">That's a great choice. Japanese cuisine has so much to offer. Alright, the cargo looks good to go. Thank you for your help!<p class=message>No problem at all. It was great working with you. Have a safe flight!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=d5d15e2b-c8d5-4c04-b0a8-66156c23ff2b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
