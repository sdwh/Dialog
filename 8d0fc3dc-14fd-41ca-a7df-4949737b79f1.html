I heard you're designing a new desktop game. What's it all about?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! Yes, we're currently developing a game about cats and their adventures in the city.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds interesting! I love cats. What kind of characters will be in the game?<p class="message sent">The main character will be a sassy little kitten who has to navigate through the busy streets to find her way back home.<p class=message>Oh, that's cute! What challenges will she have to face in the game?<p class="message sent">Well, for starters, there will be lots of obstacles in her path - cars, bicycles, and even other mischievous cats who try to distract her.<p class=message>Ha, that sounds like quite the adventure! How do you control the kitten in the game?<p class="message sent">It's a point-and-click game, so players will have to guide the kitten around by clicking on different objects in the environment.<p class=message>Nice! Will there be any fun surprises in the game?<p class="message sent">Definitely! We're planning on adding some cool power-ups that will give the kitten unique abilities to navigate through the city.<p class=message>Sounds exciting! When will the game be ready to play?<p class="message sent">We're hoping to release it in a few months, once we've finished testing it thoroughly.<p class=message>I can't wait to give it a try! Thanks for sharing the details with me.<p class="message sent">You're welcome, A! We're really excited about this game, and we think it's going to be a lot of fun for players of all ages.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8d0f71d8-06a0-495a-a0cd-8df31134c06d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
