Did you find any bugs in the code?<p class="message sent">Hey A, everything's fine. Yeah, I did find a couple of bugs. One was a minor one related to syntax and the other was a bit complex related to concurrency.<p class=message>Okay, can you tell me more about the concurrency bug? Was it difficult to find?<p class="message sent">Actually, it was not that hard to find, but it took some time to figure out the exact cause. It was a race condition issue that was occurring due to multiple threads accessing a shared resource.<p class=message>Hmm, that sounds interesting. But I'm glad that you found it. So, what's the plan for fixing it?<p class="message sent">My first approach would be to use some synchronization mechanism, like locks or semaphores. That should resolve the issue. However, I'll have to do some more testing to confirm it.<p class=message>Makes sense. I guess we can't afford to miss anything in the final release.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's always better to take extra precautions than to regret later. And how about you, did you find anything of significance in the review?<p class=message>Thankfully, no major issues. But I did suggest a few minor improvements that should make the code more readable and maintainable.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. It's always good to have a fresh pair of eyes for code review.<p class=message>Yeah, definitely. By the way, have you taken a break yet? It's been a while since we started reviewing the code.<p class="message sent">Oh no, I completely lost track of time. Thanks for reminding me. I'll take a short break and grab a cup of tea.<p class=message>Sure thing, I'll join you. And maybe we can discuss something else apart from coding for a change. What do you say?<p class="message sent">Haha, that sounds like a great idea. Let's catch up on some Netflix shows.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b3562508-072d-44bd-b138-f363fe316ffa.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
