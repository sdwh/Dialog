What are you working on?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm just checking the security protocols on our servers. Some updates need to be done.<p class=message>Oh, I see. Do you think the system is vulnerable to attacks?<p class="message sent">It could be if we don't do the necessary updates. Hackers are always finding new ways to breach security.<p class=message>Yeah, that's true. Have you thought about implementing two-factor authentication?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have it implemented on some of our systems but not all. We should definitely review and make sure it's on every platform.<p class=message>Sounds like a good idea. What other measures can we take to improve our security?<p class="message sent">We should monitor login attempts and block IPs that have repeated failed attempts. Regularly updating software and using strong passwords can also help.<p class=message>Absolutely. You know, I once had a password that was "password123", and I was shocked when it was cracked so easily.<p class="message sent">Yikes, that's not a good password. Make sure to follow the strong password requirement next time, A.<p class=message>I definitely will. Thanks for the reminder, B. By the way, have you heard about the latest security breach in the news?<p class="message sent">Yes, it's a ongoing issue that's been happening recently. It's important to stay informed and vigilant.<p class=message>Agreed. It's scary how much damage a security breach can cause. Anyway, thanks for the info, B. I'll let you continue with your work.<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Always happy to help with security.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=30aad5f1-d3df-4a70-9750-debffec5f714.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
