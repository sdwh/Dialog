I see you're the database manager for our airline. I'm the engineer who will be designing the online booking and check-in application.<p class="message sent">Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm excited to work together on this project.<p class=message>Me too. So, what do you think are the most important features we need to include in the application?<p class="message sent">Well, as a database manager, I think it's important to have a secure and reliable database to store all the booking and passenger information. What about you?<p class=message>Definitely agree. From my end, I think we need to focus on making the application user-friendly and easy to navigate.<p class="message sent">I see. How about implementing a system that allows passengers to choose their seats during the booking process?<p class=message>Good idea! And we can include an option for passengers to change their seats if needed.<p class="message sent">Yes! And what about a feature that automatically checks passengers in and sends their boarding passes to their phones?<p class=message>Perfect! And we can also include alerts for any changes in flight status or delays.<p class="message sent">Great. And we'll need to make sure the application is available in multiple languages for our international passengers.<p class=message>Absolutely. And for those who prefer human interaction, we can include a customer service hotline or live chat feature.<p class="message sent">Yes, and we should also make sure the application is optimized for mobile devices, as many people use their phones to book and check-in for flights.<p class=message>Right. And we'll need to test the application thoroughly to ensure it's working smoothly and efficiently.<p class="message sent">Agreed. This is definitely going to be a challenging project, but I'm confident we can create a great application together.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. Let's get started!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c6aae451-c12c-4f58-ba15-069ce5397a93.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
