How's the procurement going these days?<p class="message sent">It's a bit of a headache honestly. It's hard to keep up with the demand and the shipment schedules.<p class=message>Yeah, I can imagine. We've been trying to make things more efficient on our end too. Are there any particular products that seem to be flying off the shelves?<p class="message sent">Definitely toilet paper and cleaning supplies. People are still hoarding those items.<p class=message>Oh boy, don't remind me. We've had to increase our orders on those big time.<p class="message sent">I can imagine. Do you think you'll be able to keep up with the demand?<p class=message>We're definitely doing our best. Our delivery drivers have been working overtime to get everything to the stores on schedule.<p class="message sent">Good to hear. Speaking of schedules, have you seen the latest shipment schedules for the next few weeks?<p class=message>Yes, we have it all planned out. We're trying to make sure we get everything on time and delivered to the right locations.<p class="message sent">That's great. I was worried that we might not be able to keep up with the demand, but it sounds like we're both on top of things.<p class=message>For sure. We're all in this together, trying to make sure people can get the supplies they need. It's a tough time, but we'll get through it!<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Thanks for all your hard work, by the way. We couldn't do it without you guys.<p class=message>Same to you! Let's keep up the good work and continue to help make people's lives a little bit easier.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4dde1cc3-2c03-487b-9e02-c848c4311b9b.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
