Great to meet you too.<p class=message>Speaking of cuisine, we're currently in Guangdong Chaozhou, any foods you'd recommend?<p class="message sent">Definitely! You should try out the Chaozhou beef balls and the Chaozhou barbecue. They're both specialties in this region. Have you tried any yet?<p class=message>Yes, I had a chance to sample some dishes earlier today. I also had the pleasure of having some oyster omelette for breakfast.<p class="message sent">That sounds delicious. Speaking of oysters, have you tried the Chaozhou-style oyster pancakes? They're a real treat.<p class=message>No, I haven't. Where can I find them?<p class="message sent">There's this popular restaurant in the town center that serves them.

Do you have any recommendations?<p class="message sent">Oh, yes! I highly recommend the Chaozhou tangyuan, which is a type of sweet rice dumpling filled with sesame paste or red bean paste.
