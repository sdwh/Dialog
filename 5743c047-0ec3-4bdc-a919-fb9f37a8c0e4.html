What brings you to our humble school today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, A! I'm an educator, here to teach you and your fellow students about agriculture.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds interesting! I'm a farmer myself, so I'm definitely looking forward to it.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear, A. Do you have any specific crops or animals you'd like me to highlight?<p class=message>Well, we mostly grow rice, corn, and some vegetables here. As for animals, we have chickens and a few cows.<p class="message sent">Perfect! We'll definitely cover those. How do you usually handle pests on your crops?<p class=message>We use natural methods, like neem oil and garlic spray. It's better for the environment and doesn't harm the crops.<p class="message sent">That's a great approach! I'm glad to hear you're conscious of the impact of your farming practices. Speaking of which, have you tried organic farming?<p class=message>Not really, but I've heard about it. What's different about it?<p class="message sent">Organic farming uses only natural fertilizers and pesticides, and focuses on building healthy soil. It's a great way to produce healthy and sustainable crops.<p class=message>That sounds like a worthwhile endeavor. How long does it take to convert to organic farming?<p class="message sent">It can take a few years, since you need to rebuild the soil and adjust your practices. But the benefits are definitely worth it.<p class=message>I see. Well, I'm definitely interested in learning more about it. Thanks for sharing your knowledge with us today, sir!<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure, A. I'm always happy to help spread awareness about sustainable agriculture.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=573be046-2c4e-41b6-b825-e18de82f522f.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
