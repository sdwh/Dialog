Not too hot, not too cold.<p class=message>It's the perfect temperature for walking around and patrolling the streets.<p class="message sent">Speaking of patrols, have you heard about the new K9 unit that's been added to our department?<p class=message>No, I haven't. That's exciting news though. I know our four-legged friends can be a great help when it comes to maintaining public safety.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. I think it's also great for community relations. People love seeing dogs on patrol.<p class=message>That's true. Do you have any experience working with police dogs?<p class="message sent">Actually, I do. I used to work with a German shepherd that was trained to sniff out narcotics.<p class=message>Oh, wow. That's impressive. I'm sure that came in handy during some busts.<p class="message sent">Definitely. He was a real lifesaver. Speaking of lifesavers, have you tried that new doughnut shop that opened up down the street?<p class=message>Ha! No, I haven't. I try to stick to my healthy eating habits. But I've heard good things about it.<p class="message sent">You'll have to try it sometime. They have some pretty unique flavors, like bacon maple and lavender honey.<p class=message>Hmm, I'll have to keep that in mind. But for now, we should probably get back to our patrol. We don't want any trouble on our watch.<p class="message sent">Agreed. Let's keep our eyes and ears open for anything suspicious.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=44fa0a69-ff1e-4fa7-9aae-3421804e7d0d.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
