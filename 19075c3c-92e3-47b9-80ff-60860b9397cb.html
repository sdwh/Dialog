Where to?<p class="message sent">Hi there! I'm a tourist and I'm here to explore Melbourne. Can you take me around the city?<p class=message>Absolutely! Melbourne's an amazing city, I'll take you to the best spots. Do you have a particular destination in mind?<p class="message sent">Not really, I just want to see some of the famous landmarks and experience the vibe of Melbourne.<p class=message>Well, I suggest we start with the Flinders Street Railway Station, Federation Square, and the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground.<p class="message sent">Great! I've heard that Melbourne's known for its street art. Can you take me to some of the best graffiti spots?<p class=message>Sure thing! I know some of the hidden graffiti lanes that locals love to explore. How about the Hosier Lane and AC/DC Lane?<p class="message sent">That sounds perfect! By the way, do you have any recommendations for local food?<p class=message>Of course, mate. For some delicious dim-sum, we can stop by Tim Ho Wan at Bourke St. Or, we can head to Queen Victoria Market for some traditional Aussie cuisine.<p class="message sent">Yum, my mouth is already watering! Can we also visit some of the parks around Melbourne?<p class=message>Definitely! I can take you to Treasury Gardens, Fitzroy Gardens, or the Royal Botanic Gardens. They're all stunning, especially during autumn.<p class="message sent">Wow, Melbourne really has a lot to offer! This has been a great ride.
