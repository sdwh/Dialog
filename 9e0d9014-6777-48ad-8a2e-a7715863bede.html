I'm getting my boarding pass and going through security. Is it always this busy?<p class="message sent">Hi! Yes, it's always busy during peak hours, but don't worry we'll get you through in no time!<p class=message>Great, thanks! I just need to make sure I'm not carrying anything I shouldn't be.<p class="message sent">Yes, we take safety very seriously. Do you need any assistance with your carry-on luggage?<p class=message>I think I'm good, just a laptop and a few snacks.<p class="message sent">Alright, don't forget to double-check the restrictions for fluids and gels.<p class=message>Right, no more than 3.4 ounces. Got it! Do you guys get a lot of funny items in checked luggage?<p class="message sent">Oh, we sure do! Last week, we found a bag of live crickets in someone's checked baggage.<p class=message>(laughs) That's crazy! Was there a reason why they had crickets in their bag?<p class="message sent">Apparently, they were meant as a protein source for the traveler's destination.<p class=message>(laughs) Interesting. Well, luckily I'm not carrying any unconventional snacks.<p class="message sent">(laughs) That's probably a good thing. Now, let's get you on your way to your destination. Have a safe trip!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=9e0bd3e9-4e1e-4be1-bddd-5af88d081d70.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
