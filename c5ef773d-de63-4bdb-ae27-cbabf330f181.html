You must be the owner of this restaurant.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. What can I help you with today?<p class=message>I'm a fisherman and I wanted to know if you're interested in buying some fresh seafood for your restaurant.<p class="message sent">Of course! We pride ourselves on having the freshest seafood in town.<p class=message>Well, I have some jumbo prawns that I caught this morning. They're still alive and kicking, so they're as fresh as can be.<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing! We go through so many prawns, especially during the busy season. How much are you asking for them?<p class=message>I'm willing to sell them to you for a fair price, say $15 per kilogram.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Can you deliver them to the restaurant later today?<p class=message>Certainly, I'll be back in a few hours with your order.<p class="message sent">Great! I can't wait to try them out. Do you have any recommendations on how to prepare them?<p class=message>Well, grilled prawns with garlic and lemon is always a hit. Or you can try a prawn scampi with linguine.<p class="message sent">Both those dishes sound mouth-watering. I think I'll have to try them both! Thanks for the suggestions.<p class=message>No problem, happy to help. And if you ever need any more seafood, you know who to call.<p class="message sent">Definitely. Thanks again for stopping by, and I'll see you soon with the prawns.<p class=message>Looking forward to it. Have a great day!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c5eb7086-d796-479a-8770-df81defb68ad.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
