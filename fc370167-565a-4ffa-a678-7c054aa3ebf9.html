Thanks for picking me up. Can you believe this traffic?"<p class="message sent">"Oh, I know! It's always like this around here. So, where are you off to today?"<p class=message>"I'm headed to Los Angeles to visit some friends. Have you ever been?"<p class="message sent">"Oh yes, I've been plenty of times. It's a great city, but the traffic can be a nightmare."<p class=message>"Yeah, I've heard that too. I'm just hoping to make it to my friend's place before rush hour hits."<p class="message sent">"Well, we'll do our best. Mind if I turn on some tunes?"<p class=message>"Not at all, go ahead. What kind of music do you like?"<p class="message sent">"I like a bit of everything really. Some classic rock, some hip hop, even some country."<p class=message>"Wow, you really are diverse in your musical tastes!"<p class="message sent">"Gotta keep things interesting, right?"<p class=message>"Definitely! So, do you have any funny stories from working as a taxi driver?"<p class="message sent">"Oh, I've got plenty of those. I once had a guy who wanted me to drive him to the airport, but he didn't have any money. He offered to pay me in hot dogs!"<p class=message>"Ha, that's hilarious! Did you take him up on the offer?"<p class="message sent">"Nah, I had to decline. I don't think my boss would've been too happy with me bringing hot dogs back as payment."<p class=message>"Yeah, that's probably a good call. So, how much longer do we have until we get to LA?"<p class="message sent">"We should be there in about an hour or so, traffic depending. Is there anything specific you want to see or do while you're there?"<p class=message>"I'm not too sure yet. My friends have some plans, but I'm always up for some suggestions!"<p class="message sent">"Well, you could check out the Hollywood Walk of Fame, or take a tour of some of the movie studios."<p class=message>"That sounds like fun! Thanks for the suggestion."<p class="message sent">"No problem, happy to help. We'll be there before you know it!"</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=fc31a275-6da1-423c-8a9a-cc33831df8f3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
