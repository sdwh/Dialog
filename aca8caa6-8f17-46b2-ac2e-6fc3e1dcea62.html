What are you working on these days?<p class="message sent">Hey A, I'm just designing the latest puzzle game. It's going to be a real brain-teaser.<p class=message>That sounds awesome! Can you give me a sneak peek of the game's concept?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! It's a detective game where you need to solve a series of puzzles to figure out the mystery.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a challenge! What kind of puzzles are you including in the game?<p class="message sent">Oh, it's going to be a mix of logical puzzles and riddles. The players will need to use their problem-solving skills to solve them.<p class=message>I love solving puzzles! Which platform are you developing it for?<p class="message sent">It's primarily a mobile game, but we're also releasing it on PC and consoles.<p class=message>That's great! It's always nice to have more platforms to play games on. When do you think it will be ready for launch?<p class="message sent">We're hoping to launch it in about six months. We still have some work to do, but we're making good progress.<p class=message>Sounds exciting! Will there be any multiplayer options?<p class="message sent">Unfortunately, no. It's a single-player game, but we're planning to include leaderboards so that players can compete against each other.<p class=message>That's still cool! Do you have any fun Easter eggs hidden in the game?<p class="message sent">Of course! We're sneaking in some nods to classic detective fiction and puzzles. I think the players will get a kick out of them.<p class=message>I can't wait to play the game! Let me know if you need a beta tester.<p class="message sent">Definitely, I'll make sure to send you a copy when it's ready. Thanks for your interest, A!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=aca75912-2755-4608-9282-52c42b9fd660.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
