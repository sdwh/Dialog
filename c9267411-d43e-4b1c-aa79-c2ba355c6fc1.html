How was your weekend?<p class="message sent">Hi, teacher! My weekend was great. I went to the beach with my family.<p class=message>That sounds like fun. Did you swim in the ocean?<p class="message sent">Yes, and we also played beach volleyball. I realized I'm not very good at it though.<p class=message>Practice makes perfect! Speaking of practice, have you all been reviewing for your upcoming tests?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. But I'm still struggling with the grammar section.<p class=message>No problem, we can go over some grammar rules later. And by the way, have you heard about the new coffee shop that just opened near the school?<p class="message sent">No, I haven’t. What's it called?<p class=message>It’s called "Brewed Awakening," and I heard their coffee is amazing. We should check it out sometime.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me, I could definitely use a good cup of coffee.<p class=message>Speaking of coffee, did you know that Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee?<p class="message sent">Really? I had no idea.<p class=message>Yes, and it's been a cherished beverage in Ethiopian culture for centuries.<p class="message sent">Wow, that's so interesting. I love learning about other cultures.<p class=message>That's great to hear. In fact, in our next class, we'll be discussing different cultural practices from around the world.<p class="message sent">I can't wait! This class is always so interesting and informative.<p class=message>Well, thank you, that means a lot. And remember, if anyone needs help with reviewing or studying, I'm always here to help.<p class="message sent">Thank you, teacher. We appreciate it.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=c920e773-b4e8-490a-8739-77eb61a74773.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
