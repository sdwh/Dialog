How's everyone doing today?<p class="message sent">Good morning, sir! We're doing well. How about you?<p class=message>I'm great, thank you. Now let's start our lesson for today.<p class="message sent">Can we have a break first, sir? I didn't have my coffee yet.<p class=message>Sure thing, we can have a 10-minute break. But make sure to be back on time.<p class="message sent">Thanks, sir. By the way, have you watched the latest episode of our favorite tv series?<p class=message>Oh, yes! I've seen it last night. It was so intense! What did you think of it?<p class="message sent">I’m speechless, sir! It left me hanging and wanting more. Too bad the next episode won’t be available until next week.<p class=message>I know, right? The suspense is killing me. Anyway, let's continue with our lesson.<p class="message sent">Before that, sir, can you share with us your experience watching that new blockbuster movie on the weekend?<p class=message>Oh, definitely! I thought the plot was creative and the visual effects were outstanding. It's definitely a must-watch film.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear, sir. It seems like you had a fun weekend.<p class=message>Yes, I did. Now, let's focus on today's discussion.<p class="message sent">Okay, sir. We're all ears.<p class=message>So, the rule of subject-verb agreement is very important in constructing a sentence.<p class="message sent">I totally agree, sir. I've been practicing it a lot these past few weeks.<p class=message>That's good to hear, keep it up! Now, let's work on some exercises to improve your skills.<p class="message sent">Great idea, sir. We're all ready for it.<p class=message>Alright, let's start!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=ee440f91-59b6-4350-bd21-b5b0d1e1f412.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
