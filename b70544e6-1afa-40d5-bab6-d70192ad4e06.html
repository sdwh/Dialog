Nice to meet you!<p class="message sent">Hi, I'm the database manager. Pleasure to meet you as well.<p class=message>So, let's get right into the audit. Have you had a chance to review the control objectives?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It seems like we're in compliance with most of them.<p class=message>Great to hear! Anything that you're unsure about?<p class="message sent">Well, I'm not sure if we've implemented the "clear desk" policy effectively. You know, making sure sensitive documents are put away when not in use.<p class=message>Ah, that's important. We can take a look at that during the walkthrough.<p class="message sent">Sounds good. Speaking of the walkthrough, it's pretty chilly in here. Want a cup of coffee to warm up?<p class=message>I'd love that, thanks! Do you have any snacks? The audit is making me hungry.<p class="message sent">Sure thing! I have some chips and chocolate in the break room.<p class=message>Thanks, you're a lifesaver. So, it looks like your disaster recovery plan is up to date. Have you had to actually use it before?<p class="message sent">Thankfully, we haven't had to use it in a real scenario. But we do test it annually to make sure everything works properly.<p class=message>Excellent. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Alright, I think we're ready to move on to the next control objective.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me. Let's keep the momentum going.<p class=message>Agreed. And don't worry, I'll save you some chips for later.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b702d4cf-44e9-4d48-ae0c-88cd6862fcc3.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
