As a professional baker, I can say that choosing the right tea leaves is crucial for a great pairing. What kind are you looking for?<p class=message>I'm interested in a variety of leaves - white, green, oolong, and black. Would you recommend any specific ones for me?<p class="message sent">Sure thing. For white tea, I'd recommend Silver Needle. For green, Dragonwell or Gyokuro. For oolong, Tie Guan Yin or Da Hong Pao. And for black, Darjeeling or Ceylon.<p class=message>Those all sound great. Thank you. I would also like to know if you could recommend something that would go well with our bakery's famous chocolate cake.<p class="message sent">Definitely! I would suggest trying a strong black tea like Ceylon or an earthy oolong tea like Da Hong Pao. They both bring out the richness of the chocolate cake.<p class=message>Oh, that sounds perfect. How do you recommend brewing these teas to get the best flavor?<p class="message sent">For black tea, boiling water is best. For green and white tea, just under boiling. And for oolong, somewhere in between. The steeping time also depends on the type of tea, but generally 1-3 minutes.<p class=message>Thank you for the tips. I can't wait to try them out with our baked goods.<p class="message sent">No problem at all. Just let me know which ones you decide to go with, and I'll make sure to roast them perfectly for you.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=93bcb3d3-f9c3-492e-9d2f-be0e5685de41.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
