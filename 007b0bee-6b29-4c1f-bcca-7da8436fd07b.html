You've come to the right place. Are there any particular types of fish you're looking for?<p class=message>Yes, I'm interested in the tuna. I've heard it's world-famous here!<p class="message sent">Definitely. We have some of the best and largest tuna in the world. Let me show you around and give you some tips on how to choose the best quality tuna.<p class=message>Sounds great! I'm all ears.<p class="message sent">First, pay attention to the color of the fish. Tuna should have a bright red color, and the flesh should be firm and shiny.<p class=message>That makes sense. What else should I look for?<p class="message sent">You should also check the thickness of the meat. The thicker pieces are usually better for sushi or sashimi.<p class=message>Got it. This is really helpful advice. Thanks so much.<p class="message sent">No problem. It's always a pleasure to share my knowledge and passion for fish with others.<p class=message>I can see that. You really love what you do, don't you?<p class="message sent">Absolutely. It's a privilege to work in this market and be surrounded by such amazing seafood every day.<p class=message>Well, being a fisherman, I understand that feeling too. There's something special about being out on the water and catching your own food.<p class="message sent">That's true. Fishing is both a challenging and rewarding experience. It takes skill, patience, and a bit of luck.<p class=message>I couldn't agree more. And when you finally land that big catch, the feeling is indescribable.<p class="message sent">Yes, and that's the same feeling I get when I see people enjoying the fish I sell here at the market.<p class=message>Well, you can count me as one of those happy customers. I'm excited to bring some of this fresh tuna back home and cook it up for my family.<p class="message sent">That's great to hear. I hope you have a wonderful time cooking and eating your fish.<p class=message>Thanks again for all your help. I had a great time learning about the different types of fish and how to choose the best ones.<p class="message sent">Anytime. It was a pleasure to have you here at the Tsukiji Fish Market. Safe travels!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=007907e3-4a09-4955-9ae6-145c05828d1a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
