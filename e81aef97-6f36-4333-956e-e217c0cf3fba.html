Any suggestions?<p class=message>Well, there's a new comedy that just came out. It's supposed to be really funny.<p class="message sent">Sounds good to me! What's it called?<p class=message>It's called "The Good Place". Have you heard of it?<p class="message sent">No, I haven't. What's it about?<p class=message>It's about a woman who accidentally ends up in heaven and has to pretend she belongs there. It's hilarious.<p class="message sent">That sounds interesting. Let's watch it!<p class="message sent">This show is so funny! I'm glad you suggested it, Dad.<p class=message>I'm glad you're enjoying it, B. It's nice to have a good laugh every once in a while.<p class="message sent">Yeah, especially with everything going on in the world right now.<p class=message>That's true. But it's also important to remember that things will get better eventually.<p class="message sent">Yeah, you're right. And in the meantime, we'll just keep watching funny shows like this one.<p class=message>Absolutely! And maybe next time we can try a new genre, like a mystery or a drama.<p class="message sent">Sure, that sounds like a plan. Thanks for spending time with me tonight, Dad.<p class=message>Of course, son. Anytime. Let's finish this episode and then head to bed.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=e814aa02-a253-48a9-b8ed-7643654d3a97.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
