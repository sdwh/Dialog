Is it okay if I sit in the front seat?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Absolutely, please make yourself comfortable.<p class=message>Thanks! So, how long have you been a taxi driver in Marseille?<p class="message sent">Oh, for several years now. It's a beautiful city, and I enjoy driving around and showing it to visitors.<p class=message>Yes, Marseille is a lovely place, and I'm excited to explore it. By the way, do you have any recommendations for restaurants or cafes?<p class="message sent">Certainly! If you're looking for traditional French cuisine, I highly recommend La Table de Cana. And if you want something with a view, there's a great cafe called Le Cours Julien.<p class=message>Awesome, thank you for the tips! Speaking of French culture, have you ever tried playing boules?<p class="message sent">Haha, yes I have! It's a popular game here. Although, I have to admit, I'm not very good at it.<p class=message>Well, neither am I. Maybe we should team up and play against some locals for fun?<p class="message sent">That sounds like a great idea! I have some free time this evening, would you like to give it a try?<p class=message>Sure, why not? It'll be a fun cultural experience for me.<p class="message sent">Excellent! Who knows, maybe we'll even win.<p class=message>Haha, fingers crossed! Oh, and I almost forgot to ask, have you ever heard of the song "La Mer" by Charles Trenet? It always reminds me of Marseille.<p class="message sent">Of course! It's a classic French song. In fact, I have a CD of his music playing in the car right now.<p class=message>Wow, what a coincidence! It's a beautiful song, and it definitely sets the mood for exploring Marseille.<p class="message sent">Absolutely. There's something about this city that just inspires art and creativity. Maybe you'll find that inspiration too.<p class=message>I hope so! I'm really looking forward to seeing everything Marseille has to offer.<p class="message sent">Well, you'll definitely love it here. And if you need any more tips or recommendations, don't hesitate to ask.<p class=message>Thank you so much, driver! You've been a real lifesaver.<p class="message sent">It's my pleasure. Enjoy your stay in Marseille!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=f108051b-9e48-4db8-8d47-0d2cfd325144.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
