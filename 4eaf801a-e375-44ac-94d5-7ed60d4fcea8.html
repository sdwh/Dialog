Where are we headed today?<p class="message sent">Hi there! Just to the town center please.<p class=message>Great choice, there's plenty to see and do there. Have you visited Perth before?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have actually. I came here a few years ago and loved it, so I decided to come back for a quick visit.<p class=message>That's awesome! Any plans for your stay?<p class="message sent">Just some shopping and checking out the local cafes. I heard there's a new one that opened up recently.<p class=message>Oh yes, I know the one you're talking about. They have amazing coffee and pastries.<p class="message sent">That's exactly why I want to go there! I can't resist a good cup of coffee and a delicious pastry.<p class=message>Haha, I can relate to that! Have you tried any other cafes in Perth?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have actually. I visited this really cute cafe last time I was here, but I can't remember the name of it.<p class=message>Was it by any chance the Little Bird Cafe? That's one of my favorites.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's the one! Do you go there often?<p class=message>Whenever I can, I try to stop by for a quick bite. They have the best vegan options.<p class="message sent">Really? I'm not vegan, but I do love trying out new things. Maybe I'll give it a try.<p class=message>You definitely should! They're famous for their breakfast menu too. But enough about food, we're here at the town center now.<p class="message sent">Already? Time flies when you're having a good conversation, right? Thanks for the ride, and for the cafe recommendations!<p class=message>It was my pleasure! Have a great day, and happy exploring!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4eae4ce7-272e-41a7-8043-f837f9f384db.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
