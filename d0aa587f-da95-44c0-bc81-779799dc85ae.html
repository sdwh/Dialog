Moving on to network security, have you conducted a risk assessment recently?<p class="message sent">Yes, we have. Our IT team checks for vulnerabilities regularly and implements security patches promptly.<p class=message>That's reassuring. Now, let's talk about human factors. How often do you train employees on data protection policies?<p class="message sent">We have regular training sessions which cover topics such as phishing, password management, and social engineering.<p class=message>Excellent. Finally, can you show me your incident response plans?<p class="message sent">Of course. We have a detailed plan in place and we conduct regular drills to ensure all employees are aware of their roles and responsibilities.<p class=message>That's great to hear, B. Overall, your department has done an excellent job in implementing ISO 27001 standards.<p class="message sent">Thank you, A.
