How long have you been a taxi driver in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">Good morning! I've been driving for about 10 years now. It’s a great job because I get to see the city from a unique perspective.<p class=message>That's interesting. What's your favorite place to drive around in Tokyo?<p class="message sent">I love driving around the Shibuya crossing area. It’s very iconic and there's always a lot of activity going on there.<p class=message>Yeah, the Shibuya crossing is very famous. Have you ever seen a celebrity whilst driving?<p class="message sent">Actually, I did once! I had the pleasure of driving Emma Watson around a few years ago. It was a surreal experience.<p class=message>Wow, that must have been amazing! Have you driven any other famous people?<p class="message sent">Yes, I've driven quite a few celebrities over the years. I once drove Lady Gaga around for a whole afternoon!<p class=message>No way! That's so cool! Do you have any funny stories you can share with me?<p class="message sent">I remember one time I had a passenger leave a fish in the back seat of my car. It was alive and it flopped around everywhere. Definitely one of my strangest experiences!<p class=message>Haha, that's hilarious! You must have a lot of interesting stories being a taxi driver for so long.<p class="message sent">I definitely do! What about you? Any interesting stories from your travels?<p class=message>Actually, I just came back from a trip to Thailand. I ate some pretty weird things there, like fried insects and durian.<p class="message sent">That sounds adventurous! Did you like the food?<p class=message>The fried insects tasted okay, but I couldn't handle the taste of durian. It's too smelly for my liking!<p class="message sent">Yeah, durian isn't for everyone. But it’s a popular fruit in Asia nonetheless. Well, here we are, arriving in Tokyo. Enjoy your stay in the city!<p class=message>Thank you so much for the ride and the interesting conversation, driver. Take care!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=8c3c4705-0038-49ad-adde-40a390174699.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
