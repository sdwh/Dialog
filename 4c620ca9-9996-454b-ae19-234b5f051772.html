How are you doing today?<p class="message sent">Hey there, A! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?<p class=message>Couldn't be better, especially since we've got a great selection of coffee and cakes for our customers today. What's on the menu for your cakes?<p class="message sent">I've actually been working on a new recipe for a strawberry shortcake. It's got fresh whipped cream and a light fluffy sponge cake. And what about you, A? Any new coffee drinks you've been experimenting with?<p class=message>As a matter of fact, I've been playing around with a cold brew latte infused with lavender syrup. The flavors are amazing together.<p class="message sent">Oh, that sounds divine, I can't wait to try it! Speaking of flavors, have you ever thought of making coffee flavored cakes?<p class=message>Actually, I have! I've been thinking of incorporating espresso into a chocolate cake recipe. What do you think?<p class="message sent">That sounds amazing, I think our customers would love it. And while we're on the topic of new ideas, have you heard about the trend for drip cakes?<p class=message>Yes, I have! They look so cool, it would be awesome to have one on display in our store.<p class="message sent">I completely agree, and I think we could make it extra special by adding some edible flowers to the design.<p class=message>Great idea, B! And speaking of new ideas, have you thought about offering some gluten-free options for our customers?<p class="message sent">Actually, I have! I've been experimenting with some alternative flours, and I think I've come up with a recipe for a delicious almond flour cake.<p class=message>Fantastic! And I've got some gluten-free oat milk that would go perfectly with it.<p class="message sent">That's great, A! I love how we're always coming up with new ways to improve our offerings for our customers.<p class=message>Me too, B! And I love working with you, we make such a great team.<p class="message sent">Likewise, A! It's so fun to collaborate on different projects and make our customers happy with our delicious treats.<p class=message>Agreed, B! Now let's get back to work and make some coffee and cakes magic happen!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=4c614abb-965a-4773-b34e-998da7a36c45.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
