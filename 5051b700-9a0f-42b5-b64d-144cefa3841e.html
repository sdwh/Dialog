How about you?<p class=message>Same here, working on some API routes for the project. Have you had any experience using Github before?<p class="message sent">Yeah, I've used it for a few projects before. It's a great tool for collaborating with others on code.<p class=message>That's awesome. I'm still getting used to it, but I appreciate how organized everything is on Github.<p class="message sent">Definitely. It makes it easy to keep track of changes and updates. Plus, the ability to pull and merge code from different contributors is a game-changer.<p class=message>Totally agree. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but there are so many resources available online to help make using Github easier.<p class="message sent">Yeah, I remember spending quite a bit of time watching Youtube tutorials to get the hang of it. Did you find anything useful?<p class=message>Yeah, I found this great Github tutorial playlist that's been really helpful.<p class="message sent">Nice, I'll have to check it out. It's always good to have some extra help when it comes to learning new tools and technologies.<p class=message>Absolutely. It definitely takes some time to get the hang of these things, but it's all worth it in the end.<p class="message sent">For sure. It's so rewarding to see your code come to life and work seamlessly with other parts of the project.<p class=message>Couldn't agree more. Working on this project with you has been a blast and I'm excited to see what we can do with it using Github.<p class="message sent">Me too, let's keep the momentum going and knock out these backend tasks.<p class=message>Let's do it!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=50488fd8-c6b3-4d85-b118-c7a74c8d9c9a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
