Are you enjoying working at this seafood restaurant here in Busan?<p class="message sent">Hi A! Yes indeed, it's been so thrilling serving all these fresh catches from the sea to our customers.<p class=message>I understand. Our seafood is second to none in this town. Have you tried any of our signature dishes?<p class="message sent">Yes, the grilled prawns and the seafood stew are my favourites. They're so delicious!<p class=message>Glad to hear it, B. Say, have you had any unusual requests from customers lately?<p class="message sent">I had this customer who asked for sea urchin sashimi, but they only wanted the gonads. It was a bit strange, but we made it for them.<p class=message>That is indeed an unusual request! But, we always try to accommodate our customers' preferences. Speaking of, do you have any dream dish you want to create?<p class="message sent">Actually, yes! I want to create a dish that combines spicy Korean sauce with fresh oysters. I think it would be a big hit.<p class=message>That combination sounds promising. You should try it and let me taste it, B. By the way, how do you find the pace of work here?<p class="message sent">It's been busy, but the time flies by quickly. I think I'm getting better at multitasking and handling multiple tables at once.<p class=message>That's great to hear. You're doing an excellent job, B. Keep it up! By the way, did you hear about the new seafood festival happening next month?<p class="message sent">No, I didn't. What is it about?<p class=message>It's a week-long celebration of seafood, and there will be cooking demonstrations and competitions. We should take part as a team.<p class="message sent">Wow, that sounds like fun! I'm up for the challenge.<p class=message>Wonderful! Let's start planning and practicing our dishes. Our seafood will surely impress the judges and the guests alike.<p class="message sent">I'm excited to take part in the festival and represent our restaurant. Thank you for giving me the opportunity, A.<p class=message>You're welcome, B. Together we'll make this seafood festival a success. Now, let's get back to work and serve our customers with a smile!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=dd7c7043-f1e4-4b23-b245-ac42f2115c9a.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
