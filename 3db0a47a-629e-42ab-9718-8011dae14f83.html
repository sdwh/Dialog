You must be the new intern. My name is John, and I'm the lead researcher on our project.<p class="message sent">Hi, John. Yes, I'm the new intern. My name is Maria, and I'm excited to start working with you.<p class=message>Great to have you on board, Maria. Have you had a chance to look at our project proposal yet?<p class="message sent">Yes, I have. It looks really interesting! I'm particularly interested in the survey component.<p class=message>That's fantastic. We're hoping the data we collect from that will give us some valuable insights.<p class="message sent">Definitely. I was wondering if we could add a fun question to the survey, like 'What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?'<p class=message>(laughs) I love that idea. We could make it a more light-hearted way to end the survey.<p class="message sent">Exactly! It could also make people more likely to share their opinions.<p class=message>True. You've got some good ideas, Maria. I'm looking forward to working with you.<p class="message sent">Thanks, John. Likewise. Do you have any suggestions for my first task?<p class=message>Actually, yes. We need someone to contact potential survey participants. Would you like to take on that role?<p class="message sent">Sounds perfect. I'll get started on that right away.<p class=message>Great. Let me know if you have any questions, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it.<p class="message sent">Thanks, John. I'm sure I will. I'm excited to start contributing to the project.<p class=message>And we're excited to have you on the team. Let's grab lunch later and talk some more about our research.<p class="message sent">Sounds great! Thanks again, John.<p class=message>No problem, see you later!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=3dae4d48-5e43-4b26-a55a-3454d0c8f5a8.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
