I heard you run a seafood restaurant.<p class="message sent">Yes, that's right. Nice to meet you. Are you a fisherman?<p class=message>Yeah, I am. I've been fishing around these waters for as long as I can remember.<p class="message sent">That's great! I could use your help then. I'm trying to revamp my menu and I'm looking for some local and unique seafood. Any suggestions?<p class=message>Well, you should definitely try our fresh clams. They're a crowd favorite, and they'd make a great addition to your menu.<p class="message sent">I'm sold! What other seafood do you think my customers would love?<p class=message>Our crabs are always a hit. They have a sweet taste and they're meaty. Oh, and our lobster is to die for! They're so succulent.<p class="message sent">You know what? I think you're right. I'm going to put those on my menu right away. Say, do you ever come up with your own recipes using the seafood you catch?<p class=message>Yes, actually. I love experimenting with different flavors and ingredients.<p class="message sent">Would you be interested in partnering with me and coming up with some signature dishes for my restaurant?<p class=message>Of course! That sounds like a lot of fun.<p class="message sent">Great! I'll cook up some of my own ideas, and we can compare notes.<p class=message>Sounds like a plan to me. Oh, before I forget. Do you have any extra hands around here? I'm pretty good with a knife and a frying pan.<p class="message sent">As a matter of fact, I do. You're hired!<p class=message>Yes! Finally, a new adventure to sink my teeth into.</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=b3ebfad5-670c-43ac-a6da-a5b05220dc15.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
