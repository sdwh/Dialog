What are you working on these days?<p class="message sent">Hey, A! I'm actually working on the latest desktop game for our company.<p class=message>Cool! Can you tell me more about it?<p class="message sent">Sure thing! It's going to be a role-playing game set in a post-apocalyptic world.<p class=message>Ah, interesting! What kind of challenges will players have to face in this world?<p class="message sent">Well, players will have to scavenge for resources, build shelters to survive against the dangers of the world, and form alliances with other players to complete missions.<p class=message>Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. When can we get our hands on it?<p class="message sent">We're aiming to release it by the end of the year, so you won't have to wait too long!<p class=message>Can players customize their characters?<p class="message sent">Absolutely! Players can select their character's gender, appearance, skills and abilities.<p class=message>That's fantastic!
