I heard we're working on a new e-commerce system. How's the database design going?<p class="message sent">Hey, A. Yes, we're designing a new SQL Server schema for the system. The design is going well so far, just figuring out the optimal table structure.<p class=message>Cool. What are some of the new features we're adding in this system compared to the old ones?<p class="message sent">We're incorporating some new customer behavior data analytics features, and we're also doing more personalized recommendations for customers. So we need to ensure all the relevant data is being captured and linked.<p class=message>Ah, sounds like we're going to need a lot of tables then. Would it make sense to optimize the system for parallel query execution?<p class="message sent">Yes, that's definitely something we're considering. Particularly with the increasing data size we're dealing with, parallelism should help us speed up query times.<p class=message>Great, sounds like we're well on our way towards an optimal design. Anything else we should be thinking about?<p class="message sent">Yes, we also want to pay close attention to the potential for data duplication across tables. We want to minimize redundancy as much as possible, but also avoid ending up with a completely normalized schema.<p class=message>Makes sense. And what about choosing the right indexes?<p class="message sent">Yes, we need to think about the right type and number of indexes to use so that we can optimize for the most common queries.<p class=message>Got it. Well, it sounds like we're well on our way towards having a well-designed database schema for our new e-commerce system. Thanks for the update, B!<p class="message sent">No problem, A. Looking forward to seeing what we can achieve with this new system!</div><div class=col-12><div class="col-lg-6 text-end mx-auto"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg mb-3"href=79024b61-b1ff-4bae-9233-fc58ad164a0e.html>Next</a></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script><script src=js/scripts.js></script>
